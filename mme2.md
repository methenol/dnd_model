# PRAISE FOR MONSTER MANUAL EXPANDED II

"5/5. The Monster Manual Expanded II does exactly as promised: this tome delivers dozens more variants based on the reference bestiary, Volo's Guide to Monsters, and the creatures of Mordenkainen's Tome Of Foes."

- Bob World Builder

"5/5. Better than the first! Wowee this book has every monster I have ever wanted that wasn't covered in the official Monster Manual plus heaps more. Up to par with the official 5e books, if not better in some places. Full art, and over 300 pages. An absolute tome! Personal favorite: The Grim."

- P. B. Publishing

"5/5. Remember how great Monster Manual Expanded 1 was? Well you can take that and double it with Monster Manual Expanded 2. Long story short, buy it - you won't regret it."

very well conceived and equally well

a lot of new and original pieces."

- Nerd Immersion

"5/5. For content here ... the amount you're getting ... I have to give this 5 out of 5!" - Allthingslich

- Adam D.

- Aran M.

examples of artwork throughout, including

"5/5. This monster manual supplement and its predecessor is, hands down, the most informative and helpful monster supplement I've seen and used ... It has everything I look for in a monster book, including short hooks in the monster descriptions to spin off your own adventure and challenging foes. This is a work of love, and it pays off."

- A Customer

"5/5. Worth the money. I purchase quite a few of the interesting items that pop up on DM's Guild, and not many carry the same level of value as this."

- Callum S.

"5/5. Great collection of monsters. What dungeon master doesn't need new monsters?"

- Kyle T.

### ABOUT THIS BOOK

Monster Manual Expanded II is a continuation of the best-selling Monster Manual Expanded, which is to be used as a source of content to supplement the 5th edition Monster Manual, Volo's Guide to Monsters, and Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes. It aims to provide the Dungeon Master with more options and variants of the monsters presented in those books, as well as provide extra value to Dungeon Masters who own multiple types of miniatures of the same creature.

### ABOUT THE COVER

Monster Manual Expanded II, since it is half based on Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes and released during the arrival of Descent into Avernus, has a large number of fiends. What better way then to feature one of the most endearing and popular demon lords of all the time. the Oueen of the Demonweb Pits herself. Lolth. This beautiful artwork was crafted by the talented Sandeson Gonzaga. We've had multiple versions of this piece. The first two pieces were more of a manga-style insane Lolth (as seen near the end of this book). We went for a serious expression for the final book version. Thanks to Rowena Zaragoza for allowing us to use her face as a model. : )

# THE BESTIARY

his book continues what Monster Manual Expanded started. Once again it builds on what exists in the first Monster Manual, adding several new variants for the classic humanoids and giants, and thus providing you with more archetypal options. The key additions here are the kings, sharpshooters, and vanguards.

As mentioned in the book's cover, the Monster Manual Expanded II also includes creatures found in Volo's Guide to Monsters and Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes. As in the previous book, you'll find both advanced and lesser versions of the creatures to give you more flexibility in building your encounters, using your miniatures, and, most importantly, keeping your players on their toes. As before, several nostalgic favorites from previous versions have been added as well.

Due to the release of this book coinciding with Descent into

Avernus, you shouldn't be surprised to find a legion of new fiends to play around with. There are over a dozen new demons and devils that have been added, as well as a couple of new ones, such as the horrid brachavyrm and the wretched gastrobolus. You'll also find in these pages the Spider Queen herself, plus a trio of Archdevils that's been curiously missing from the main books.

But the biggest addition you'll discover is the return of the Aspects, which I find very important. Not many DMs, like myself, run a lot of high level or epic campaigns. This means most epic level monsters, especially the various archdevils and demon lords, will rarely be encountered. Aspects are a great way to increase the presence of these fiends in your campaign and allows you to create a mid-level preview of what's to come at the end if you ever plan to get there.

And lastly, new NPCs can be found at the end of the book, as well as a special section for diabolic and abyssal cultists!

# ALLIP

### DREAD ALLIP

It is said that when a group of people working together uncover or stumble upon a dangerous secret known only by the archdevil Dispater, a horrible curse befalls all of them. This knowledge instantly drives them mad and enraged, causing them to attack and tear each other apart until all of them are dead. From their grisly remains, there is a chance that a dread allip will rise.

Twisted Amalgamation. Unlike the normal allip, the dread allip is a twisted amalgamation of each of the poor souls driven insane. Multiple distorted faces pulsate through its head and shoulders, all whispering and babbling incoherently. Any living soul unlucky enough to be within hearing distance of their whispers falls prey to the allip's clutches.

Undead Nature. A dread allip doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Challenge 9 (5,000 XP)

Aura of Insanity. When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the allip and is able to hear the allip, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw, unless the allip is incapacitated.

 On a failed save, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d10 to determine what it does during that turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing except mutter words incoherently. On a 5 to 7, the creature takes no action but uses all its movement to move in a random direction. On a 8 to 10, the creature

makes one melee attack against a random creature, or it does nothing if no creature is within reach.

If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the allip's Aura of Insanity for the next 24 hours.

Incorporeal Movement. The allip can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The allip makes two attacks with its maddening touch and then uses whispers of madness.

Maddening Touch. Melee Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d6 + 4) psychic damage.

Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.

Howling Babble (Recharge 5-6). Each creature within 30 feet of the allip that can hear it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (4d8 + 4) psychic damage, and it is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't stunned. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.

# ARANEA

### ARANEA

An aranea is an intelligent shapeshifting creature not unlike a lycanthrope. In its natural form, the aranea appears as a giant spider with slender humanoid arms in place of its pedipalps. Its thorax has a humpback-shaped bulge that houses its brain. The aranea's other form is that of a humanoid female.

Magically Adept. An aranea is naturally gifted with the arcane arts. Due to their highly secretive nature, they focus their expertise in the schools of illusion and enchantment. Some, although very rarely, even have psionic abilities.

Silk Weavers. Despite their nature, most aranea are neutral and will keep to themselves, often living at the fringes of civilization so as not to attract unwanted attention to themselves. Those that manage to live within city walls work as silk weavers and silk traders and can live out their lives normally without getting exposed.

Evil Aranea. Evil aranea are con artists and serial killers that use their guile and magical charms to lure innocent victims into their hovels where they can ensnare and cocoon them with their webs and place them in their larder-like attics.

Male aranea do not have the ability to shapechange into humanoid form and have no magical abilities. They only serve the female as consorts and guards.

The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

### ELDER ARANEA

A colony of aranea is always led by an elder that acts as a hive queen. The elder is a powerful and intelligent spellcaster that will prioritize the safety of its kin above all else.

An evil elder aranea will lead its colony in insidious attacks against small humanoid communities. The aranea will ride into a hamlet in a caravan posing as silk merchants. By morning the next day, the aranea have charmed, isolated, and led the men and guards into ambushes. When they determine that there are no more threats, they enter the houses one by one and capture and cocoon each of its inhabitants, including children and livestock. The aranea will then stay in that hamlet for weeks, feasting on their captured prey, and whoever else that might wander into the hamlet. After completely devouring the place's inhabitants and divesting it of its valuables, the aranea colony will move once more to find another suitable place to strike.

# ATHACH

### ATHACH

An athach is a massive 18-foot tall giant that has a third arm growing from its malformed, portly body and a gnarled, tusked maw that drips with debilitating venom. The creature never bathes, and the stench its body emits is nearly overpowering.

Obsessive Hoarder. An athach is a greedy collector of gems, jewelry, and precious metals. It has an obsessive fascination with such objects, polishing and talking to them for hours in its lair. When it isn't admiring its loot, it sets out to hunt for food or look for more treasure, which directly puts it into conflict with dwarves, mining settlements, and merchant caravans.

Paranoid Sociopath. Due to its greedy and obsessive nature, the athach is a solitary creature. It will never live with another intelligent being it doesn't intend to eat, and very rarely will it be with another of its kind, except probably its mate. But due to its greed, the relationship does not last long as they will soon try to murder each other for fear that the other will steal the other's treasures. An athach, on the other hand, may have monstrous pets, such as hydras, owlbears, and otyughs, to guard its lair.

Grappling Brute. In combat, it moves with a lumbering gait, crushing enemies with its enormous tree-trunk club. It will try to grab targets smaller than itself and will then either bite their heads off, slam them to the ground, or fling them like a missile weapon against other foes.

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller target. Hit: 14 (2d4 + 9) bludgeoning damage and if the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 19) and restrained until the grapple ends, and the athach can't use Slam on another target.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) piercing damage and if the target is a creature, it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the target is incapacitated. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects on itself on a success.

Slam Foe. The athach slams a creature grappled by it into another creature it can see within 5 feet of it or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or take 22 (3d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be stunned until the end of the athach's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't stunned.

Fling. One creature grappled by the athach is thrown up to 40 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 9 + 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

A THE PERSON DIARDA

# BALHANNOTH

### ELDER BALHANNOTH

A balhannoth, if left alone for decades, can gain a vast amount of power from devouring countless victims. It eventually evolves into the more fearsome elder balhannoth. Extremely rare even in the Shadowfell, the elder balhannoth will either take over balhannoth colonies as its alpha or destroy and consume everything (even its kin) within miles of its territory to ensure it has no competition.

Irresistible Lure. The elder balhannoth has developed an ability to emit an aura of enchantment around it. When a creature enters this aura, the elder balhannoth immediately digs deep into its mind, draws forth its greatest desires, and then projects a reality-warping manifestation of it that only the unwitting creature can see. This causes the victim to approach the elder balhannoth, oblivious to the actual danger.

Enticing Presence. Any non-balhannoth creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the balhannoth must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed by the balhannoth for 1 minute. While charmed by the balhannoth, a target is incapacitated. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the balhannoth, the target can take the Dash action on its turn to move toward the balhannoth by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the balhannoth, a target can repeat the saving throw.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the balhannoth's Enticing Presence for the next 24 hours.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the balhannoth fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### ACTIONS

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the balhannoth can't use this tentacle against other targets. The balhannoth has four tentacles.

Tentacle Slam. The balhannoth slams creatures grappled by it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or take 19 (4d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage and be stunned until the end of the balhannoth's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't stunned.

### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The balhannoth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The balhannoth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Bite Attack. The balhannoth makes one bite attack against one creature it has grappled.

Tentacle Attack. The balhannoth makes one tentacle attack. Teleport. The balhannoth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying and any creatures it has grappled, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Vanish. The balhannoth magically becomes invisible for up to 10

minutes or until immediately after it makes an attack roll.

# BANDERHOBBS

### BANDERHOBB SHADOW ASSASSIN AND RAIDER

Banderhobbs normally have a short existence. They expire once they fulfill their duties, leaving only a puddle of dark goo and a puff of shadow. In some very rare instances, however, a banderhobb may reform in the Shadowfell and continue to live the rest of its existence there, evolving into more mature versions of their normal ilk. They eventually band together, loosely kept in line by the most powerful in their group. They are often hired and summoned by fiends, cultists, and evil spellcasters to serve as mercenaries.

### BANDERHOBB BOGEYMAN

Once in awhile, there will be a banderhobb of exceptional guile and skill that reforms in the Shadowfell. Birthing the legend of the Bogeyman, this deadly banderhobb can shift from the Shadowfell and into the Material Plane. While it enjoys feeding on flesh, it requires consuming psychic energies generated by frightened and stressed beings to sustain its magical abilities.

A banderhobb bogeyman can normally be found leading a band of banderhobb shadow assassins and raiders.

2/day each: major image, phantasmal killer, plane shift (self only)

Resonant Connection. If the banderhobb has even a tiny piece of a creature or an object in its possession, such as a lock of hair or a splinter of wood, it knows the most direct route to that creature or object if it is within 1 mile of the banderhobb.

Shadow Stealth. While in dim light or darkness, the banderhobb can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The banderhobb makes three attacks: one with its bite or tongue and two with its claws.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (5d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15) if it is a Large or smaller creature.

Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) psychic damage and the target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Swallow. The banderhobb makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the banderhobb, and it takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the banderhobb's turns. A creature reduced to 0 hit points in this way stops taking the necrotic damage and becomes stable.

The banderhobb can have only one creature swallowed at a time. While the banderhobb isn't incapacitated, it can regurgitate the creature at any time (no action required) in a space within 5 feet of it. The creature exits prone. If the banderhobb dies, it likewise regurgitates a swallowed creature.

Frightful Presence. Each creature of the banderhobb's choice that is within 120 feet of the banderhobb and aware of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the banderhobb's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

Shadow Step. The banderhobb magically teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of dim light or darkness that it can see. Before or after teleporting, it can make one melee attack.

# BARGDA

### BARGDA

Once in every generation, a hill giant worshiper of Baphomet will give birth to a Bargda. Seen as a gift from the unholy union between giant and demon, the Bargda is regarded as a boon to its tribe and is groomed to become its leader. Towering over its hill giant brethren, the Bargda's physique and visage is a bent and twisted version of its progenitor.

Horned Tyrant. Aware of its heritage, the bargda uses its position to lead and force its kin to do its bidding. The bargda also subjugates other lesser giants and monsters such as ogres, trolls, minotaurs, and verbeeg and uses them to expand its territory. It normally leads hunting parties into humanoid communities in search of treasure, slaves, and food.

Venomous Saliva. While the bargda's great club and menacing horns can prove to be a challenge, adventurers should also watch out for its bite and saliva which has enough toxins and bacteria to bring any able-bodied creature to an agonizing death in a matter of days.

Charge. If the bargda moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horns attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.

Horrid Visage. When a creature that can see the bargda starts its turn within 30 feet of the bargda, the bargda can force it to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw if the bargda isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against the bargda until the start of its next turn. If the creature looks at the bargda in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the bargda's Horrid Visage for the next 24 hours.

### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The bargda makes three attacks: one with its bite or horns, and twice with its greatclub.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d10 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

Horns. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

Greatclub. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

# BARGHESTS

### BARGHEST WHELP

The young barghest whelp may look like a goblin, but this sly shapechanger is only biding its time until it can gather enough power and return to Gehenna by consuming goblinoid souls.

Wolf in Goblin's Clothing. Unlucky adventurers may stumble upon a goblin nest, only to find a barghest whelp hiding among the goblins. When discovered, the whelp can revert to its true form that of a feral canine and rip the flesh and soul of its prey in mere seconds.

### GREATER BARGHEST

Greater barghests are mature barghests that have consumed nearly all the goblinoid souls they need to return to Gehenna. These vicious beasts have grown larger and more powerful than its brethren by consuming only the souls of powerful goblinoid warriors and spellcasters, and the occasional adventurer.

Fiendish Commanders. It is not uncommon to encounter greater barghests leading their goblinoid armies, with their unfortunate goblin underlings both serving as slaves and sources of sustenance. Due to their strength and cunning, some greater barghests have even formed alliances with creatures that goblinoids might find too troublesome to be with on their own, such as hill giants, ogres, hags, harpies, trolls, and verbeeg.

# BEHOLDERS

### DOOMSPHERE

Urban legends speak of the bodies of adventurers who were unfortunate enough to encounter the ghostly globe of death. Lifeless bodies frozen in fear and anguish, no one can tell how they came to their gruesome ends. Perhaps this spectral beholder passed through their bodies, its necrotic touch corrupting flesh and bone. Or perhaps one look at its pale, abhorrent visage was enough to drain the life out of its victims.

Mad Orb of Undeath. A doomsphere is the restless spirit of a beholder that spawned after its death due to a curse or was created by powerful necromantic magic. In extremely rare

Antimagic Cone. The doomsphere's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the anti magic field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the doomsphere decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the doomsphere's own eye rays.

Ethereal Sight. The doomsphere can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

Incorporeal Movement. The doomsphere can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

### ACTIONS

Withering Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (4d8 + 2) necrotic damage.

Etherealness. The doomsphere enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

Eye Rays. The doomsphere shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:

 1. Chill Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (4d8) cold damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn. This ray has no effect on creatures immune to cold damage.

2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

instances, a beholder that sought lichdom but failed in the ritual would instead return as a doomsphere. The creature retains almost all of its arsenal of abilities, save a few that have changed due to undeath. Most, but not all, tend to become insane after this ghastly reincarnation.

The doomsphere continues to "live" beyond death as the vile xenophobic beholder it once was, only far more dangerous and more isolated this time and adventurers know better than to invade its old stomping grounds, which it haunts to this day.

Undead Nature. A doomsphere doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

3. Fear Rav. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. ending the effect on itself on a success.

5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the doomsphere moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the doomsphere's next turn or until the doomsphere is incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The doomsphere can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.

7. Exhaustion Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion.

8. Withering Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature ages 1d4 x 10 years. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

9. Disintegration Rav. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.

10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.

Amphibious. The eye of the deep can breathe air and water.

Baleful Flash. The eve of the deep's central eve projects a blinding flash of light in a 60-foot cone as a bonus action. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute.

Innate Spellcasting (psionics). The eye of the deep's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). The eye of the deep can innately cast the following spells, without providing material components:

At will: major image

### ACTIONS

Eye Rays. The eye of the deep shoots two eye rays, choosing one to two targets it can see within 120 feet of it:

1. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### EYE OF THE DEEP

An aquatic sub-species of beholders, the eye of the deep is only found in the darkest depths of the ocean or the deepest subterranean lakes of the Underdark. Growing to about five to nine feet in diameter, the eye of the deep retains its beholder-like qualities with a cyclopean eye and a large maw of razor-sharp teeth. Unique among its kind, the eye of the deep only has two eye stalks but is armed with two limbs ending in crustacean-like pincers that it uses to crush and dismember its foes. Instead of projecting an antimagic cone, its central eve creates a bright burst of light that can leave its enemies unlucky enough to be looking at it blinded for a minute.

Intolerant Tyrants. True to its nature, the eye of the deep is xenophobic and fiercely territorial. While they may tolerate and subjugate nearby weaker life forms such as kuo-toans, merrow, and sahuagin, other dangerous, intelligent beings such as aboleths and morkoths are a different matter. It will relentlessly try to destroy or drive them out if it can. Otherwise, it will seek out new territory.

### GOUGER

Gougers are large beholder-kin created by phaerimms eons ago to hunt and kill other beholders. Slightly larger than a normal beholder, the gouger possesses the same magical powers as that of their kin and is armed with an abrasive and razor-sharp tongue that it uses as a whip. It even has four tiny legs under its body that enables it to skitter if forced on the ground. Because of its nature as a beholder-hunter, gougers have grown stronger than their brethren and can negate another beholder's magic. They are also quite insane.

Aggressive Stalkers. While the phaerimm have since mostly forgotten about them, the gougers continue to aggressively prowl the Underdark, hunting actively for beholders. This doesn't mean they will not attack other creatures, however. In fact, they will almost always attack and prey on anything Large or smaller on sight to sustain their eternal hunt. It is quite possible however to convince them to stop attacking or enter a truce if they are provided information about a beholder's location.

Each time the beholder target fails its saving throw, it loses another use of its eye ray or central eye (determined randomly, rerolling any duplicates).

Beholders that do manage to escape, and these are the exceptional ones, end up roaming the Underdark seeking its own territory where it can make its mark and grow into adulthood.

While the bodak still prefers to use its terrifying gazes to kill its foes, the ravager enjoys using its imposing size and strength to crush its enemies.

Undead Nature. A bodak ravager doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

# BOGGLE

Arcane Tricksters. These boggles are canny rogues that dabble in enchantments and illusions which they use for distraction while it skips in and out of the darkness to steal from, frighten, and - inopportune moments - torment its victims. While they do not intentionally try to kill anyone, they can be very dangerous if backed in a corner, if that is at all possible.

Sneaky Infiltrators. When not engaging in pranks to amuse themselves, boggle tricksters are sometimes hired as spies by their fey masters to infiltrate strategic targets, such as a noble folk's keep, a church, or a wizard's tower where they can potentially encounter adventurers hired as guards.

Cruel Sentinels. While weaker than the standard boneclaw, lesser boneclaws are still intelligent undead that can serve as elite guards. Their finger claws can still extend to a distance of 15 feet, their bony faces twisted in a macabre smile as they skewer and slice their victims apart with ease.

# BUNYIP

### BUNYIP

Looking like a cross between a shark and a leopard seal, the bunyip is a curious specimen of nature. Covered in a seal's matted fur, but with the fins, tail, and serrated teeth of a shark, the bunyip is an aquatic predator that can be found in shallow bodies of freshwater and near sea caves. It generally keeps to itself, heading out in the open only to forage for edible plants and hunt for prey. It is normally solitary, using its keen sense of smell to avoid encounters with other creatures and humanoids unless it can ambush them.

Frenzied Killer. What makes a bunvip dangerous is when it smells blood in the water, which sends it in a savage frenzy. A bite from a bunyip can become a life and death struggle for its victim. The bunyip drags its prey underwater and proceeds to thrash its head sideways, tearing and shredding its victim senseless.

### DIRE BUNYIP

The extremely rare gigantic bunyip lives in isolation and is the alpha of its kind. A very hungry dire bunyip has been known to attack small ships or boats docked near shallow waters or stuck in polar ice, slamming into and attempting to overturn them to get to its crew and cargo.

# CADAVER COLLECTOR

### GREATER CADAVER COLLECTOR

The greater cadaver collector is an ancient juggernaut of war. Only a few were made due to its exorbitant costs and difficulty to create, but they were probably worth the trouble as they still exist, roaming the ancient battlefields of the Lower Planes for eons. Both demons and devils give them a wide berth, lest they get added on to the mighty construct's grisly collection.

War Machine. In battle, the greater cadaver collector can summon multiple specters for aid as it uses its massive iron fists to bludgeon opponents into mush. Creatures unable to resist its paralyzing breath are crushed and trampled by its massive stomps. Those unfortunate enough to get captured suffer a worse fate: getting impaled on the construct's armor spikes and left there to suffer and slowly die as they bleed out.

# DEEP SCIONS

### DEEP SCION ASSASSIN

A deep scion assassin works with cruel efficiency. It often comes in the guise of a flamboyant sea merchant or a sultry maiden traveling through town, looking for wine and entertainment. One does not need to count long until it has everyone relaxed and disarmed with its charm. The assassin expertly marks and seduces its target, then disappears into the shadows with the unsuspecting prey. Its target disappears from the town completely, people believing the couple running off. The assassin, its job complete, returns to the sea and waits for its master's next command.

### BRACHAVYRM

The loathsome brachavyrm is a creature of nightmares that prowls the fens, jungles, and marshlands of the Abyss. This demon resembles a giant 20-foot long, slime-coated, segmented worm with a maw ridged with sharp teeth. Its midsection splits into two tails, each ending with a wicked-looking stinger. Pairs of emaciated arms ending in clawed hands extend grotesquely from its segmented body and function as the creature's legs.

Arm Collector. The brachavyrm is a solitary predator that hunts for mortal humanoids. Each time a brachavyrm consumes a humanoid, a pair of arms will sprout from the sides of its

elongated body. As the brachavyrm consumes more prey, more arms are created. But these arms wither and die after a short period, causing the brachavyrm to constantly hunt for more humanoids.

Versatile Predator. In combat, the brachavyrm first spits a line of saliva from its maw towards its target. The saliva instantly hardens into sticky, web-like filaments upon contact with air, and can entangle a target. Once a creature is ensnared, the brachavyrm lunges at it and quickly impales it with its twin stingers. After the venom is injected, the demon wraps its body around the victim, constricting it at the same time that its multiple clawed arms dig and tear through its flesh. Finally, the fiend bites the helpless prey and slowly swallows it whole.

Spider Climb. The brachavyrm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The brachavyrm makes four attacks: one with its bite, one to constrict, and two with its tail stingers. It can replace its bite attack with swallow or web spray, if available.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the brachavyrm can't bite another target.

Tail Stingers, Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned.

Swallow. The brachavyrm makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the brachavyrm, and it takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of the brachavyrm's turns.

If the brachavyrm takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the brachavyrm must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the brachavyrm. If the brachavyrm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

If a swallowed creature dies and the creature is a humanoid, the corpse's body is consumed and a pair of arms sprout from the brachavyrm's body. When this happens, the creature can only be restored to life only by means of a resurrection spell or greater.

Web Spray (Recharge 5-6). The brachavym spits webbing in a line that is 30 feet long and 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 15 Strength check, escaping from the webbing on a success. The effect ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 10, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage and and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.

### NUCKALAVEE

According to legend, the nuckalavee was once a powerful champion of good that fell in battle against the forces of the demon prince Orcus. As punishment, the champion and its steed are transformed by the Demon Prince of Undeath into a demon. This is partially true. Deathpriests of Orcus perform an unholy ritual where they sacrifice, willing or otherwise, a knight and its steed to the demon lord. A mighty abyssal fiend is summoned and uses the sacrifice as its vessel. Both man and steed are then fused together in an agonizing ritual that brings forth the nuckalavee - a fiendish abomination whose horrifying visage can bring unending nightmares to those that gaze upon it. The resulting appearance - crimson ropy muscles visible through translucent skin, black blood coursing through yellow veins, an equine skull jutting from its midsection is horrific.

Amphibious Fiend. While it may be a fiend, the amphibious nuckalavee is normally encountered in the Material Plane. wading in dismal watery places such as fog-filled bogs and marshlands.

Bringer of Woe. Like all servants of Orcus, the nuckalavee is devoid of its heart, and its once righteous spirit has been replaced with a desire for death and destruction - all for the glory of the demon prince of undeath. It now serves as a terrifying herald of Orcus. Some say that when someone a nuckalavee is sighted, disease, drought, and pestilence shall soon follow.

Champion of Undeath. The nuckalavee's entire being seethes with necrotic energy. Its very presence instantly kills nearby animal and plant life, leaving only death and decay at its wake. It is not surprising then that it can be found in the company of undead, even serving them as their leader.

Baleful Weapons. In combat, the nuckalavee can be a deadly opponent that should not be underestimated. Its potent breath can instantly cause flesh and bone to rot, and its dreaded claws can cause instant death to those who are foolish enough to challenge it.

If the initial saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is paralyzed while frightened in this way. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the nuckalayee is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Iovoc

Jovocs are small, obnoxious demons that roam in packs in the Abyss. Standing only at around four feet tall, jovocs resemble dark-skinned hairless shriveled humanoids that have long arms that end in three clawed fingers that are permanently stained with blood.

Angry Mob. While jovocs appear to be weak compared to other demons, they make up for it in sheer numbers. They have been known to take on bigger and stronger targets, overwhelming them with coordinated attacks.

Aura of Retribution. What make jovocs a real threat in battle is their aura of retribution which allows them to magically inflict pain against nearby creatures when they get hurt. When facing multiple enemies, the jovocs employ a nasty tactic. Instead of directly attacking their foes, jovocs will claw each other, enabling them to deal damage to multiple targets.

### PALRETHEE

Palrethees were ambitious lesser demons that aspired to become greater ones but failed in some unknown trial that destroyed their original forms. They now appear as tall, emaciated humanoids with vestigial wings protruding from their back and hot flames enshrouding their entire bodies. They can control the appearance of their flames, turning them from searing blue, translucent and ghostly, or bright fiery orange. Palrethees often serve as captains to lesser demons or as attendants to greater demons, such as a balor.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

Flaming Warrior. In combat, palrethees can be difficult opponents due to their constant body flames. A mere touch or striking them with a melee weapon can cause severe burns. For offense, they rely mostly on their martial abilities, cutting down foes with their flaming greatsword. If faced with large numbers of foes, palrethees will fall back on their ability to cast fear.

### Zovvut

Zovvuts are said to be the horrific bastard spawn of angels that were assaulted by greater demons and demon princes. They resemble large, muscular hairless ogres with fanged and tusked maws and arms that end in scimitar-like finger claws. Wretched feather wings stretch from their humped backs, the only vestige left of their angelic heritage. Make no mistake, zovvuts may be half an angel, but their hearts are full of hate and anger as their demonic parent's which is probably why they resent being commanded or spoken down to by their more powerful ilk.

Reckless Brutes. Foul tempered and hard to control, their masters often just set them loose against foes and left on their own, which is probably wise. Zovvuts rely mostly on their brute strength, wading recklessly into melee and shredding their victims with their fearsome claws. Against tougher targets, zovvuts utilize their dreaded draining gaze which simultaneously deals necrotic damage that can't be cured and healing the zovvuts' wounds.

# DEMON: DEMON LORD

### LOLTH, THE SPIDER OUEEN

Lolth, the Queen of Spiders, is the primary deity of the drow. Cruel and unforgiving, Lolth demands blood and sacrifice from her worshipers. Those who gain her favor are gifted with her boon, and those who do not are severely punished by Lolth herself. This has caused much of the infighting within the drow, as Houses fight against each other to bring the best sacrifices to the Spider Queen. In truth, Lolth does not have an ounce of care for her worshipers; she simply revels in the death and destruction being spread about in her name. Her hatred spans millennia and goes back to the time when she was exiled to the Abyss. To this day, all the plans she enacts are all for the downfall of those who sent her to the Demonweb Pits.

Spider Queen. Lolth usually appears as a slender female drow dressed in silk made from spider webs. Her true form, however, is the epitome of the Queen of Spiders. Lolth has the upper half of a strikingly beautiful female drow, with long white hair and gleaming black and purplish eyes. Her humanoid waist is connected to the head of a giant black spider with eight glowing red eyes, two poisonous fangs, and eight chitinous legs that end in razor-sharp points.

Demonweb Pits. There are many ways to access the 66th layer of the Abyss where the realm of the Demonweb can be found but getting out may be the biggest problem. The Demonweb is a mass of tunnels and pathways that stretch from all directions and are all full of webs, traps, and its hungry denizens. No one has ever been able to map this maze-like pit because Lolth constantly changes paths when she spins her webs.

The entire realm of Demonweb is difficult terrain, and any creature that seeks to traverse its web-filled tunnels will need to take care not to get caught in any of the webs lest they be food for Lolth's faithful. The Pit, which resides at the bottom of the Demonweb, is a dark cavern Lolth occupies. The entire cavern is lit with blue flame torches scattered about its numerous alcoves. Thick webs cover every corner and also form a natural carpet on the floor, making walking more difficult for everyone except spiders and spider-kin alike. In the middle of the cavern is Lolth's throne, just behind a stone altar used for sacrifices. Behind the throne is a set of golden doors through which are multiple passages to different planes and locations.

Vicious Sadist. Lolth is known for extreme cruelty and sadism. She takes great pleasure in inflicting pain and psychologically tormenting her prey. In the rare instances that she finds herself in combat, she will toy with her opponents first, giving them false hope that they might have a chance of defeating her, only to quickly turn the tables and reveal that she was never in any real trouble. She will prioritize targeting those who are beloved by all so she can revel in their agony as she slowly kills that target while the rest of her victims watch helplessly in horror.

Deadly Foe. As a deity, Lolth is incredibly powerful and does not need weapons when fighting. She usually summons her faithful handmaidens, or yochlols, and select high level drow servitors to fight for her. Lolth relies on her spellcasting abilities to confound her opponents and trap them in her steel-like webs. Each of her legs can be used as a spear and can stab and pierce creatures with ease as she goes for the kill with her poisonous fangs.

# THE ASPECTS

eities and fiends will sometimes send a portion of their power to the Prime Material Plane in order to provide assistance to their worshipers. These fragments of spiritual energy manifest in an "Aspect," a being that is similar in form to their originators but are not directly controlled. Instead, they are a separate entity

altogether, albeit sharing the same agenda as its progenitor. Aspects can never be summoned, but highly favored priests or mages can petition their gods to bestow upon them an Aspect.

Born of Power. Despite being just a portion of the progenitors' power, the Aspects will take a physical and biological form that is nearly identical to their progenitor and with near matching attributes and traits, but obviously scaled down in power. They always appear as large or larger sized forms and will sport a weakened version of their progenitors' favored weapon (should they have one). Unless specified, fiendish Aspects last 666 days

before they dissipate, or until recalled by their progenitor. There can be only One. Only one Aspect can exist at a time, no matter how many times the progenitor creates them. In addition, the progenitor cannot exist in the same plane as its Aspect. When the progenitor creates an Aspect, it actually sends an essence of itself to the destination plane. Only when it reaches that plane does the Aspect form. Once an Aspect is created, the progenitor must recall it first or wait for it to dissipate before it can create another Aspect.

Independent Extension. Aspects are not directly controlled by their progenitor nor can they see through the Aspect's eyes or learn any knowledge the Aspect discovers. They are independent beings after their manifestation and will act in accordance to their alignment and general goal of their progenitor. They are aware that they are not the 'real' beings, but understand that they are an extension and take comfort that once they dissipate, they will return to their real form.

# DEMON: THE ASPECTS

### ASPECT OF BAPHOMET

Baphomet, the Horned King, may bestow his petitioners an Aspect if it is going to be used to hunt prey.

The Aspect of Baphomet will appear as 15-foot tall dark-furred minotaur, its head topped with six iron horns. It sports a weapon that looks similar to Baphomet's Heartcleaver, but is just a lesser copy.

> The Aspect of Baphomet does not share the same cunning as its progenitor, but its savagery and might in combat are much in line with the Prince of Beasts.

In combat, the Aspect will immediately charge at its foes. Only against challenging opponents will the Aspect even think of using its spells or its Frightful Presence ability.

### ASPECT OF BAPHOMET

Huge fiend (demon), chaotic evil

Armor Class 16 (natural armor) Hit Points 150 (12d12 + 72) Speed 40 ft.

Damage Immunities poison

Condition Immunities charmed, exhaustion, frightened, poisoned Senses darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 19 Languages all, telepathy 60 ft. Challenge 11 (7,200 XP)

Charge. If the Aspect of Baphomet moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 13 (3d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.

Innate Spellcasting. The Aspect of Baphomet's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: detect magic

1/day each: dispel magic, dominate beast, hunter's mark

Labyrinthine Recall. The Aspect of Baphomet can perfectly recall any path it has traveled, and it is immune to the maze spell.

Legendary Resistance (1/Day). If the Aspect of Baphomet fails a

saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Reckless. At the start of its turn, the Aspect of Baphomet can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The Aspect of Baphomet makes three attacks: one with Heartcleaver, one with its bite, and one with its gore attack.

Heartcleaver. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage.

Gore. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage.

Frightful Presence. Each creature of the Aspect of Baphomet's choice that is within 120 feet of the Aspect of Baphomet and aware of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Aspect of Baphomet's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The Aspect of Baphomet can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Aspect of Baphomet regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Charge. The Aspect of Baphomet moves up its speed. Heartcleaver Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The Aspect of Baphomet makes a melee attack with Heartcleaver.

### ASPECT OF DEMOGORGON

The Aspect of Demogorgon will be about 15 feet in height with a body of that of a green-scaled dinosaur with a huge forked tail. It's muscular and hairy torso is topped with two leering simian heads that resemble a cross between a baboon and a mandrills.

Of all Aspects, the Aspect of Demogorgon is probably the most difficult to measure and anticipate its actions. Being the embodiment of chaos, madness, and destruction, its worshipers are always taking a huge risk to petition for one. But then again, almost all worshipers of Demogorgon are deranged, if not totally insane.

The Aspect of Demogorgon will act similarly as its progenitor, with its two simian heads not caring where their gaze might land, even if it falls on a loyal worshiper. Which is probably why its worshipers will only petition one when they are in desperate need or in a dire situation, such as when their temple is being attacked by a party of powerful adventurers.

In combat, the Aspect of Demogorgon will seemingly appear to employ random attacks, not focusing on any single target. In truth, each of the two heads are simply following its own tactical course of action and will not work together unless faced with a strong foe.

### ASPECT OF DEMOGORGON

Huge fiend (demon), chaotic evil

Armor Class 16 (natural armor) Hit Points 178 (17d12 + 68) Speed 50 ft., swim 50 ft.

Condition Immunities charmed, exhaustion, frightened, poisoned Senses darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 21 Languages all, telepathy 60 ft. Challenge 14 (11,500 XP)

Innate Spellcasting. The Aspect of Demogorgon's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: detect magic, major image

1/day each: dispel magic, fear, telekinesis

Legendary Resistance (1/Day). If the Aspect of Demogorgon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Two Heads. The Aspect of Demogorgon has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, deafened, stunned, or knocked unconscious.

### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The Aspect of Demogorgon makes two tentacle attacks.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

Gaze. The Aspect of Demogorgon turns its magical gaze toward one creature that it can see within 60 feet of it. That target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the target is incapacitated, it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze and to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see the Aspect of Demogorgon until the start of the Aspect of Demogorgon's next turn. If the target looks at the Aspect of Demogorgon in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the target fails the save, the target suffers one of the following effects of the Aspect of Demogorgon's choice or at random:

1. Beguiling Gaze. The target is stunned until the start of the Aspect of Demogorgon's next turn or until the Aspect of Demogorgon is no longer within line of sight.

2. Hypnotic Gaze. The target is charmed by the Aspect of Demogorgon until the start of the Aspect of Demogorgon's next turn. The Aspect of Demogorgon chooses how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and movement. Because this gaze requires the Aspect of Demogorgon to focus both heads on the target, it can't use his Maddening Gaze legendary action until the start of its next turn. 3. Insanity Gaze. The target suffers the effect of the confusion spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of the Aspect of Demogorgon's next turn. The Aspect of Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spell.

### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The Aspect of Demogorgon can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Aspect of Demogorgon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.

Maddening Gaze. The Aspect of Demogorgon uses his Gaze action, and must choose either the Beguiling Gaze or the Insanity Gaze effect.

### ASPECT OF FRAZ-URB'LUU

Rarely does Fraz-Urb'luu share its essence to create an Aspect of itself, especially if the ones petitioning for one are unaware that they are petitioning the Prince of Deception. If it ever happens, however, an Aspect of Fraz-Urb'luu may not share the same skill level of deceit and illusory powers of its progenitor, but it is more than capable enough to deal with most enemies.

The Aspect of Fraz-Urb'luu will appear as a 10-foot tall muscular, green furred gargoyle with reptilian features. Large fin-like ears stretch from the side of its head and long tendril-like whiskers dangle from each side of its chin.

In combat, the Aspect will employ hit and run tactics, swooping in to strike vulnerable targets and flying away before its allies can help. In between those strikes it will

use its spells such like Phantasmal Killer to take out those that are most likely to be susceptible to it.

### ASPECT OF FRAZ-URB LUU

Phantasmal Killer (Costs 2 Actions). Fraz-U rbluu casts phantasmal killer, no concentration required.

A STATUS SEAR FRANCE A CONSULT OF CONSULT OF

### ASPECT OF GRAZ'ZT

Of all demon lords of the Abyss, Graz'zt is the most likely to grant a follower's petition for an Aspect. The Dark Prince of Pleasure, unable to resist feeding his vanity, enjoys the awe his Aspect inspires upon his worshipers.

The Aspect of Graz'zt stands just slightly smaller than its handsome progenitor at nearly 9-feet tall. Its muscular body is covered in dark purplish skin, and it has six fingers on each hand as well as six toes on each foot. It wields a greatsword that has the likeness and near power of Wave of Sorrow but nowhere near Graz'zt's skill in combat and magic.

In combat the Aspect will rely mostly on its martial prowess and Wave of Sorrow. It will only resort to its spells if faced with a challenging foe.

### ASPECT OF JUIBLEX

Of all demon lords, the least likely to ever bestow an Aspect is Juiblex. The Faceless Lord is apathetic, even to its own worshipers. It would take a very specific reason for it to ever allow it, which is the promise to be able to consume and absorb an insurmountable number of living matter, such as unleashing the Aspect in the middle of a human bustling city or an elven treehome community.

The Aspect of Juiblex will resemble a 9-foot tall, horrid-looking amorphous mound of greenish, slimy ooze with numerous tendrils. Its glistening, slimy body is riddled with pulsating bloodshot eyes and gaping, biting maws ridged with sharp teeth.

In combat, the Aspect will use its Eject Slime against armored targets and then concentrate its acid lash attacks against the most vulnerable foe, attempting to kill it quickly so it can consume it. It will seldom use its spells, unless to finish off a foe.

### ASPECT OF |UIBLEX

Eject Slime (Recharge 5-6). The Aspect of Juiblex spews out a corrosive slime, targeting one creature that it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 27 (5d10) acid damage. Unless the target avoids taking any of this damage, any nonmagical metal armor worn by the target takes a permanent -1 penalty to the AC it offers, and any nonmagical metal weapon it is carrying or wearing takes a permanent - 1 penalty to damage rolls. The penalty worsens each time a target is subjected to this effect. If the penalty on an object drops to -5, the object is destroyed.

### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The Aspect of Juiblex can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Aspect of Juiblex regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### ASPECT OF KOSTCHTCHIE

Kostchtchie will only answer petitions from his frost giant worshipers, and if ever, it doesn't take much effort for as long as it allows the Aspect to unleash its bloodthirsty rage and wreak havoc against as many enemies as possible.

The Aspect is nearly identical in size with its progenitor, resembling a cross between an ogre and a frost giant. Its muscular body is squat and rotund and stands about , and its skin is deathly white with shades of icy blue. It wields an almost exact copy of its mightv, oversized warhammer that emanates bluish frost.

In combat, the Aspect of Kostchtchie will hardly deviate from its course of action, which is to angrily crush and maim as many foes as it can, hardly casting any spells. The only thing that would cause it to alter its actions is when it spots a challenging opponent. It would then use its curse on its opponent before charging towards it.

### ASPECT OF LOLTH

The Demon Queen of Spiders will only answer petitions from a favored drow worshiper, and only if the petition has something to do with taking vengeance against an entity or organization Lolth hates.

The Aspect of Lolth will always appear as that of Lolth's drider-form or that of a horrid-looking huge spider with Lolth's strikingly beautiful head.

While it may not match the natural cunning of its progenitor, the Aspect will still personify her extreme cruelty and hatred against all non-Drow races and will take great pleasure in tormenting and destroying its foes.

In combat, it will first cause as much pain and suffering on its targets, toying with them for as much as she can. Only when it feels threatened will it make use of its full powers to bring them down.

### ASPECT OF ORCUS

Petitioning Orcus for an Aspect will only have a chance of success if the reason for the petition furthers the goal of the Demon Prince of Undeath, which is the nullification of all life.

The Aspect of Orcus stands about 12-feet tall and has a disgusting corpulent body that is covered with animal hair. Its head and legs resembles that of an emaciated giant goat's and massive leathery bat-like wings spread from its back. In its hand is a lesser but still potent copy of its dreadful weapon, the Wand of Orcus.

The Aspect of Orcus always begins combat summoning undead before wading into battle. If it finds an opportunity to trap or block targets within melee range from escaping, it will use its Creeping Death ability and cast it centered on itself.

### ASPECT OF YEENOGHU

The demon lord and god of gnolls, Yeenoghu, the Lord of Savagery, desires slaughter and destruction above everything else. He enjoys inflicting pain and misery to his victims before he killing them, and crushing everyone else's hopes.

For Yeenoghu to grant an Aspect, the petitioner should be a powerful gnoll or flind with and use the Aspect for furthering the Beast of Butchery's desires.

The Aspect of Yeenoghu appears as a 12-foot tall, gaunt gnoll with emaciated features. Its body, which radiates an overpowering and disgusting musky smell, is covered with a leathery hide topped with a dirty orange mane, and protected with garish, spiked armor scraps tied together with chains and decorated with the flayed skin of its progenitor's foes.

In combat, the Aspect of Yeenoghu will mostly just attack with its flail, never bothering with spells unless the situation warrants it. If given the chance, the Aspect will not immediately kill those it fights. Instead, it will maim them first, then slay and devour those they love in front of them. Only when it has broken its foes will it finish them off.

On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmov. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).

The Demon Queen of Fungi may grant petitioners her Aspect if the will use it to infect as many living creatures with her spores.

The Aspect of Zuggtmoy looks like a 14-foot tall fungal creature that has the features of a female humanoid dressed in a faux gown made of lichen and mycelium. Sprouting from its lower torso are fibrous tentacle-like pseudopods that excrete poison.

To prepare for a big fight, the Aspect of Zuggtmoy will always create thralls and spore creatures first. Only when it is satisfied that is has enough, will it venture forth to seek its enemies.

In combat, the Aspect of Zuggtmoy will lash at and batter its foes with its pseudopods. If it can catch more than two targets, it will release its infestation spores. Those that survive its initial attacks will be subjected to its mind control spores.

# DERRO

### DERRO BERSERKER

Berserkers are usually placed at the frontlines of battles and hunting parties not just because of their fighting prowess, but because no one else wants to fight beside them. Berserkers are rabidly aggressive and are prone to attack anything it sees, enemies and derro alike. Hook guards and thugs placed in the frontlines keep berserkers at bay with their spears while taskmasters keep their rage focused on enemies.

# DEVILS

### CORNUGON

Cornugon devils are an elite subtype of horned devils that serve under archdevils. They are known for their strength, fighting prowess, and magical abilities.

Terrifying Fiends. Typical cornugon devils stand at around 11 to 12 feet tall, are overly muscular, and have steel-like scales or tough fur covering their body. Two great horns flank each side of their head, and their massive leathery or feathered wings stand well above their full body, enough to serve as a shield in battle. Their appearances vary, and will closely resemble the archdevils they serve. For example, cornugon devils who serve under Bael will look like massive winged minotaurs while those who serve under Dispater will look like armored humanoids that have ridged, iron scales covering its body and metallic wings.

Archdevils' Elite. Cornugon devils are often tasked to lead lesser devils in combat or if grouped together, serve as the archdevil's elite troops. When a favored cultist prays for an archdevil to deal with a major threat and the cultist's sacrifice is deemed worthy, the archdevil may send a cornugon.

Warrior Spellcasters. In combat, cornugon devils take a dual role. They start off as artillery support, unleashing devastating long range spells from afar to break clustered enemy ranks while also dispelling any magical threats and barriers that may hinder their allies. When the battle finally joins, they take flight and dive at the most dangerous but vulnerable targets, such as enemy spellcasters. Against challenging opponents, cornugon devils will utilize both their martial and spellcasting abilities to full advantage, often creating illusions to distract and mislead while making hit and run tactics.

### DOGAI (ASSASSIN DEVIL)

The dogai, also known as assassin devils, are highly skilled silent killers, infiltrators, and spies who serve the Lords of the Nine and other archdevils. If they are not on spying missions against the demons, they are sent to the Material Plane to assist and take care of problems the worshipers of the Nine pray and ask for, such as troublesome adventurers.

Meticulous Planners. If a dogai is sent to assassinate a target, it will first plan its approach, assess the target's location, and make preparations. It will never engage a target unless it can have total surprise. It will always conjure its shadow blade beforehand, and will utilize its shadow abilities to ensure it reaches striking distance unnoticed.

### GASTROBOLUS

A gastrobolus is a wretched devil that is normally found in infernal sewers, dungeons, and blood-soaked battlefields. It looks like a bloated, single-horned humanoid with the lower body of a disgusting giant snail. Poisonous spines protrude from its sides, and its skin and outer shell is coated with a corrosive, sticky slime.

Fiendish Cleaners. The gastrobolus is sometimes called the custodian of the Nine Hells. It sweeps, scavenges, and clears the floors and grounds of organic materials.

Incapacitating Weapons. In combat, the gastrobolus excretes and throws acid globs at its targets. The acid globs are caustic and sticky, burning and restraining a victim hit by it. If a target is within melee range, the gastrobolus uses its spines to impale and inject its target with paralyzing venom. Once its prey has been rendered helpless, the gastrobolus opens its abhorrent central maw, which is located at the lower front side of the devil, and then swallows the creature whole. The victim is then deposited into its acid vat-like abdomen to be consumed completely.

glob attacks. It can use Swallow in place of one of these attacks.

Spine. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned, the creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Acid Glob. Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) acid damage and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be restrained. While restrained, a creature takes 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of the gastrobolus's turns. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 17 Strength check, escaping from the acid glob on a success. The effect ends if the acid glob is destroyed. The acid glob has AC 10, 5 hit points and immunity to acid, poison, and psychic damage. The gastrobolus is immune to its acid globs.

Swallow. The gastrobulus swallows an incapacitated Large or smaller creature. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the gastrobolus, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the gastrobolus's turns.

If the gastrobolus takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the gastrobolus must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 5 feet of the gastrobolus. If the gastrobolus dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Teleport. The gastrobolus magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing and carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

### PAELIRYON

A paeliryon is a greater devil that does its work unseen. This devil believes that information is the key to advancing in power and as such, is responsible for the spy and assassin networks that rivals even Lolth's.

> The paeliryon is a disgusting sight to behold, with a massive bloated obese body covered in warts. Its massive face is framed by a devious, redlipped smile that prominently shows its rows of sharp teeth. On its back sprouts two bat-like wings with ends flayed like old leather and its hands are armed with poisoned claws painted in blood red.

> > Out of the dark. Paeliryons rarely come out in the open, preferring to leave its agents to do the dirty work. When a paelirvon does come out, it means the plan has gone wrong, or an opponent has piqued its interest. Few rarely see this happen, and even fewer survive, for paeliryons are incredibly powerful spellcasters that rival even some of the demon lords of the Nine Hells.

### PASSION DEVIL

Passion devils were created by the archdevil Fierna in her likeness and image, and are therefore both strikingly beautiful and terrifying. While the passion devils serve Fierna officially as ambassadors to the courts of other archdevils or dukes of the Nine Hells, their true purpose is to infiltrate enemy ranks and spy on other devils.

Emotional Manipulators. Passion devils rarely engage in combat and instead use their powers of domination, manipulation, and seduction to meet their objectives. If forced into a fight it does not like, it will use its spells and abilities to sow just enough confusion and discord for it to escape.

Passion devils rarely travel alone, and are often accompanied by bearded devils that serve them as bodyguards.

### REMMANON

The remmanon appears as a naked androgynous humanoid creature that is constantly hovering a few feet above the ground. Barbed chains and hooks adorn its hairless skin, and long ram-like horns curl backwards on each side of its head.

Devils of Discord. Remmanons are greater devils of discord, greed, jealosy, and lust. They hate and destroy the concepts of camaraderie, kinship, teamwork, trust, and harmony by sowing dissonance among mortals, breaking their ranks from within. Most remmanons can be found in Phlegethos, and serve the archdevil Fierna, while a few work under Dispater and Mammon.

Insidious Manipulators. In combat, remmanons prefer to stay behind the front lines and will very rarely engage in melee. They would rather manipulate and influence without been seen, using spells and their Insidious Aura to do most of the damage. If hardpressed, they summon bearded devils to protect them and if they must, use their devastating hellfire touch that can incinerate a creature and leave nothing but ash.

### XERFILSTYX

The xerfilstyx is a greater devil that has the upper form of a huge winged devil, while its lower half is that of the body of a giant slug. It lives within the depths of the river Styx, sampling the memory fragments of souls that flow through it. Having lived in the waters of Styx, the xerfilstyx devil has been driven insane from the constant bombardment of memories. Like the sweetest of poisons. a xerfilstyx takes pleasure in the memories it absorbs while it dissolves its own mind. It is this insanity that drives xerfilstyx to attack other creatures, eager to drive them into the waters of Styx and taste memories within it. It is also because of this that other devils avoid them.

Opportune Fighters. Xerfilstyx fight from the safety of the river Styx, unleashing a barrage of offensive ice-based spells to stun its enemies until it can charge in for a grapple. Once an enemy is grappled, the xerfilstyx will suck out its blood and then plunge it into the waters of Styx to end its life. When faced with overwhelming numbers, the xerfilstyx will use its dreaded blood breath, exhaling its own blood which is so caustic it can melt flesh like butter.

# DEVIL: ARCHDEVILS

### ASMODEUS

Asmodeus, the Lord of Nessus, is the supreme master of the Nine Hells. Deep within The Pit, the lowest point of all of Baator, Asmodeus sits on his throne as he leads the eight archdukes of Hell and schemes towards the total conquest of the cosmos. Asmodeus believes that existence would be better off if he was to rule it. His main goal is to destroy all of creation and rebuild it in his image, pure and serene with him at the top. Those who do not know his true capabilities see this as an arrogant vision bound to fail, if only they knew that Asmodeus is one, if not the most, intelligent and competent creatures in the plane of existence.

Being the most cunning of all. Asmodeus has the rest of the archdukes in the palm of his hands. While the other archdevils may have incredible power and sizable armies, Asmodeus is able to diffuse hostilities through his incredible charisma and unassailable logic. The other archdukes are incredibly wary of raising arguments with Asmodeus, for fear of being drawn to a contract that they know will only benefit him.

Majestic Ruler. No one knows the true form of Asmodeus, but he often appears as a 9-foot-tall humanoid with dark red skin, long black hair, and two horns. He is always dressed in an expensive-looking majestic black and red robe, covering the still bleeding wounds from his body that he gained when he was forcefully exiled to the Pit a millennia ago. The wounds, though centuries old, never cease to bleed, and yet Asmodeus is able to keep his calm demeanor befitting the regal station of a supreme ruler. Asmodeus is never without the Ruby Rod, an all-powerful artifact given to him by Primus which he uses to bind souls into an unbreachable contract. Through the ages, Asmodeus has learned to channel the Ruby Rod which has evolved his powers to the godly levels.

Nessus. Nessus, the lowest layer of the Nine Hells, is a barren plain devoid of any life or activity. The ground on Nessus is extremely flat, and is dotted with massive gouges, gorges, and canyons that are miles across and dozens of miles deep. Wooden bridges in various states of disrepair are scattered across some of the gouges. Deep below the gouges that span several miles deep, pit fiends and all kinds of devils cling to the walls and outcroppings, waiting for any soul unfortunate enough to have fallen into Nessus.

Most of the canyons and gouges in Nessus end in fiery pits of lava except for the ones that houses the creatures that form Nessus' great army.

Fortress Nessus. Notable among these locations is Malsheem, an enormous city that is home to Fortress Nessus. Asmodeus' stronghold. The citadel sits at the very bottom of the Pit, and is only accessible to those he calls upon. While Nessus is a barren wasteland, the insides of the fortress is like that of a magnificent castle, intricately designed and furnished in gold and other expensive elements. Those that step in are immediately weighed down by the stifling aura of despair. Asmodeus' throne sits at the bottom of the fortress, and is guarded by pit fiends, cornugons, and his generals. Any creature that manages to find Asmodeus himself will first have to deal with the immense aura of submission that comes from him. Asmodeus loathes mortals and weaker creatures and will usually not appear nor accept their challenge. Instead, he sends his most powerful generals to dispose of them.

Unassailable Logician. Asmodeus is one of the most powerful beings in the cosmos. Aside from being a mighty divine caster, his time with the Ruby Rod has given him even more deadly abilities. But what makes Asmodeus a truly dangerous opponent is his unmatched logic. If ever he finds himself in combat with equally powerful beings, Asmodeus will constantly explain to them the error in their ways, even while he is being assaulted. Halfway through the fight, he would have already planted the seeds of doubt in his opponents, who will slowly begin to question themselves and the necessity of fighting Asmodeus. By the time the fight is over, his opponents would be divided, and some would have already joined his side.

On a failed save, the creature must kneel and bow before Asmodeus until the start of its next turn. Until this kneeling and bowing ends, the target can't take actions or reactions, and its speed is 0 and can't be increased. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to Asmodeus's Aura of Submission for the next 24 hours.

Swift Caster. While wielding the Ruby Rod, Asmodeus can use a bonus action to cast a spell that has a casting time of one action.

### ACTIONS

Multiattack. Asmodeus attacks twice with his Ruby Rod and uses his Chill Gaze.

Ruby Rod (+5 Mace). Melee Weapon Attack: +20 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d8 + 11) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 27 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must kneel and bow before Asmodeus until the start of its next turn. Until this kneeling and bowing ends, the target can't take actions or reactions, and its speed is 0 and can't be increased, unless Asmodeus forces it to (see Command Submissive below).

Chill Gaze. Asmodeus turns his magical gaze toward one creature he can see within 120 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 31 (6d6 + 10) cold damage, can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage.

Reverie of Nessus (1/Day). While wielding the Ruby Rod, Asmodeus magically creates a 5-foot radius spherical wall of force centered on Asmodeus that lasts until the start of Asmodeus's next turn. This wall of force functions as both the wall of force and the antimagic field spells. While inside this sphere, Asmodeus can function as if under the time stop spell. In addition, Asmodeus is automatically purged of any unwanted physical and magical conditions, enchantments or effects, diseases, and maladies (including lost body parts). Furthemore, Asmodeus regains all hit points and gains the benefits of someone that has completed a long rest.

Teleport. Asmodeus magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

Asmodeus can take 4 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Asmodeus regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

### Chill Gaze. Asmodeus uses his Chill Gaze.

Command Submissive. Asmodeus targets one creature that is kneeling and bowing he can see within 60 feet of him. The target uses its reaction to move up to half its speed and make one weapon attack against a creature of Asmodeus's choice that he can see.

Teleport. Asmodeus uses his Teleport action.

Ruby Rod (Costs 2 Actions). Asmodeus attacks with his Ruby Rod. Master Strategist (Costs 2 Actions). Roll d10 for Asmodeus. Depending on Asmodeus's choice, the number rolled on the die is subtracted from an attack roll made against Asmodeus or an ally of his choice or a saving throw roll made against Asmodeus within the next minute. Alternatively, the number rolled can be added to Asmodeus's next ability check, attack roll or saving throw within the next minute, if he so chooses. Asmodeus can keep up to 3 Master Strategist dies at a time.

Cast a Spell (Costs 1-4 Actions). Asmodeus expends a spell slot to cast a 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-level, or 4th-level spell that he has prepared. Doing so costs 1 legendary action per level of the spell.

Summon Pit Fiend (Costs 4 Actions). Asmodeus magically summons a Pit Fiend. The devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Asmodeus, acts as Asmodeus's ally, and can summon other devils if it has such power. The devil remains until Asmodeus dies or until he dismisses it as an action.

### DISPATER

The reclusive lord of Dis rules the second layer of Baator with a militaristic grip. Hidden within his main lair, the ominous Iron Tower, Dispater sits on his throne surrounded by the weapons, treasures and scrolls of secrets he has gained throughout millennia. The Lord of Iron stands at an imposing height of 7 feet, with steel-like, bluish skin that is cold to the touch. His black hair is always swept back, prominently showing the two horns on his forehead. Dispater prefers to roam his castle in resplendent regalia, but underneath the royal robe is a unique adamantine armor that he personally crafted and designed to protect him from any attack no matter how powerful. The armor gleams in the darkness, imbued with magical charms that allows him to teleport to safety if he is about to be harmed. Always cautious and prepared, Dispater has a heavy mace at his side, and a gleaming black rod with his symbol at the top serving as his badge of office.

Arms Dealer. Dispater trades in iron and secrets. The most vicious weapons in all nine layers of Hell come from Dis and Dispater sits at the top of all arms deals, selling weapons and armor to both sides of any battle. The most powerful weapons, however, are in the hands of his archdukes and trusted commanders, with a select few stored in his throne room for his own use.

Within the main chamber of the tower sits a mound of scrolls full of secrets that Dispater has collected throughout his life. This veritable treasure trove of knowledge has been the object of envy among the other lords, seeing it as a new source of advantage over each other. The secrets that Dispater has collected has always come at a price. Creatures will often bargain their souls as payment for the answer to a secret, which Dispater always gladly collects to fuel his soul harvesters.

The Iron Tower. Dispater rarely leaves his fortress, preferring to stay inside his libraries and workshops as he watches over Dis through the eyes of his minions. The Iron Tower stands in the middle of Dis, and always looks like it is farther than it seems. The tower is completely black and is always enveloped in dark mists and shadows. Erinyes constantly circle the tower, ensuring that no one gets in or out without Dispater's approval.

Dispater is the only one who decides who is allowed to go in and out of the fortress and getting in is a near-impossible task. There are several ways to get in the tower and all have deadly consequences. One may try to secure the services of the imps that loiter along the streets of Dis. These imps usually pose as mischevious and chattering children and are willing to guide anyone through the maze-like city and into the fortress for a price. Adventurers beware though, because the imps' true goal is to lure would-be victims to their deaths.

Due to Dispater's deep paranoia, he prefers to stay in his fortress and instead send messages to his archdukes through letters sewed on the bodies of imp servants. These messengers use a secret passage to travel in and out of the fortress. Adventurers may attempt to follow the imp as it goes through the secret passage, though they will need to take great care not to harm or kill the imp, lest Dispater be alerted.

Dispater's Lair. The halls of the Iron Tower is as labyrinthine as the city it stands on. Hallways and chambers look identical and no pathway looks the same after passing through it, leading intruders in a hopeless, trap-filled, rat race to find Dispater's throne room.

Dispater's lair sits at the top of the Iron Tower, underneath the dome that forms the highest point of the tower. The circular room has obsidian black walls which are as hot as all the walls in Dis, and four full-sized windows that Dispater uses to watch the entire city. In the middle of the room is a dais where Dispater sits on his iron throne. On one side of the throne is a rack of weapons that Dispater has chosen for his private collection. On the other side is a long table full of maps and plans that cover the second layer and the city of Dis that Dispater uses to create his security and construction plans. Lined up against the walls are the numerous scrolls of secrets that Dispater himself guards with magic connected to his life force.

Rust and Discord. Anyone who tries to reach the main lair and challenge the Lord of Iron will need to contend with the room's unbearable heat and Dispater's aura of fear. Metal obviously has no effect on him, any weapon or armor that he touches rust almost immediately. Opponents will also have to deal with his ability to teleport and summon powerful erinyes and horned devils to fight for him, as well as his ability to share the shameful and despicable secrets of his opponents to their allies, twisting the truths, and forcing them to fight each other.

### MEPHISTOPHELES

Mephistopheles, the Lord of Cania, is the Archduke of the eight layer of Hell. Steeped in research and acquisition of knowledge, Mephistopheles has spent countless millennia on the study of arcane magic. The expanse of his research has attracted the attention of other archdukes, most notably Dispater the lord of the second, who now regularly sends envoys to Cania in case Mephistopheles stumbles upon new knowledge that he would also like to acquire. The most prominent research on Mephistopheles' table is that of hellfire magic. While he is the only one who has mastered the use of hellfire magic, Mephistopheles willingly imparts the power to influential people and devoted followers in order to build up and strengthen his cult following.

Irritable Lord. On the surface, he has a calm demeanor like that of a welleducated and sophisticated gentleman. But as Asmodeus's foremost wizard of the Nine Hells, Mephistopheles is impatient and unforgiving, and is prone to killing minions and other creatures that he may perceive to be distractions or annoyances to him. Over 9 feet tall with red skin, a muscular body, leathery bat wings, two curved great horns, long black hair, and vellow eyes, Mephistopheles' appearance is that of a traditional devil that mortals perceive. He wears a long, black cape and always carries his ranseur, a vicious three-pronged staff through which he can channel his hellfire magic.

Cania. Adventurers who dream of going to Cania will need to survive the frigid temperature that it offers. Without any protection, any creature will freeze to death in seconds while exposed to Cania's punishing weather. Mephistopheles chooses to keep the entire layer of Cania under freezing temperatures and ice storms to deter unwanted visitors. Anyone wishing to visit Cania will need to sign a written approval from Mephistopheles himself which grants visitors protection from the cold weather, but also makes them subject to Mephistopheles's Word of Injunction. Most visitors are loyal worshipers and powerful wizards who would like to study under Mephistopheles or offer him new knowledge. These unfortunate visitors soon find themselves the fancy of the Lord of Eight and are soon unwillingly bound to a contract and forced to toil in the vast libraries and research laboratories of Cania for all eternity.

Mephistar. The Citadel of Mephistar is the manor of Mephistopheles. Perched on top of the tallest point of Cania and surrounded by glaciers, Mephistar acts as the Lord of Eight's main laboratory. The entire citadel is colder than Cania, and the citadel's inhabitants, who are mostly scholars, sages, and wizards, have learned not to touch the walls for fear of freezing their limbs instantly. This design was not made to punish the dwellers though. Mephistar was brought to lower than freezing temperatures so that the citadel could sustain Mephistopheles' hellfire experiments. Some areas that house the strongest hellfire experiments have already started to melt and are creating icy pools on the floor. While these pools are a trivial matter to its denizens, naïve wanderers and intruders may find themselves frozen in an icy pool of water or dying of hypothermia.

Hellfire and Ice. The hallway to Mephistopheles lair is lined with various ports and hidden holes that blast hellfire from time to time. While others may see this as a trap, Mephistopheles only designed this for his amusement. In the middle of his lair, Mephistopheles sits on a slowly melting throne, with a "moat" of icy water surrounding the dais. The temperature in the room can change depending on Mephistopheles' whim. Adventurers who wish to defeat the Lord of Eight will have to deal with extreme heat and cold as they battle Mephistopheles. The archduke is an archmage and can emit an aura of hellfire from his body at will. As the true master of hellfire, Mephistopheles can disintegrate opponents through hellfire with nothing but a gaze. While Mephistopheles possesses all of these powers, he perceives combat as trivial and will have his subordinates and the ice devils he summons to fight for him.

Hellfire Aura. As a bonus action, Mephistopheles can emit an aura of diabolic fire, appearing swathed in dark searing flames. A creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of Mephistopheles, or touches him or hits him with a melee attack while within 10 feet of him and the Hellfire Aura is active takes 11 (2d10) fire damage. A creature that takes damage from the Hellfire Aura becomes vulnerable to fire damage until the start of its next turn. The Hellfire Aura remains until Mephistopheles dies or until he dismisses it as an action.

Innate Spellcasting. Mephistopheles's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

Multiattack. Mephistopheles makes two ranseur attacks.

Ranseur. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) fire damage and the creature is vulnerable to fire damage until the end of Mephistopheles' next turn.

Hellfire Gaze (Recharge 5-6). Mephistopheles's eyes project intense fiery energy in a 120-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 29 (6d6 + 8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine ash and slag. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.

Word of Injunction (1/Day). Mephistopheles utters a dreadful word of power that can compel one creature it can see within 60 feet to die instantly or be assailed with waves of intense pain. The creature must have entered into a legally binding contract with Mephistopheles beforehand. Otherwise, it has no effect.

If the target has 150 hit points or less, Mephistopheles can choose to have its hit points reduced to 0 and its corpse reduced to ashes. Otherwise, Mephistopheles can cause the target to be affected by crippling pain and any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.

A target suffering this pain can make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.

Teleport. Mephistopheles magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

The devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Mephistopheles, acts as Mephistopheles's ally, and can summon other devils if it has such power. The devil remains until Mephistopheles dies or until he dismisses it as an action.

# DEVIL: THE ASPECTS

### ASPECT OF ASMODEUS

Asmodeus, despite being the most powerful fiend in the known multiverse, ironically does not make it difficult to grant a petitioner an Aspect. However, the petitioner must willingly sign away his soul in eternal servitude to Asmodeus.

The Aspect of Asmodeus may not match the cunning and calculating logic of its progenitor, but it still captures the Lord of Nessus's magnetic appeal. The Aspect appears as a 13-foot tall, dark-skinned man with extremely handsome features. Two short curving horns sprout from its forehead and its eyes glow a

On a failed save, the creature must kneel and bow before the Aspect of Asmodeus until the start of its next turn. Until this kneeling and bowing ends, the target can't take actions or reactions, and its speed is 0 and can't be increased.

malevolent red. It wears a rich crimson robe made from the most expensive materials and wields a faux version of the Archfiend's Ruby Rod. The Aspect exudes a charismatic aura that captivates any that look at it to kneel and bow in reverence and adoration.

While it may lack its progenitor's brilliant tactical mind, the Aspect is still a mighty being to face. Its spell abilities are already more than enough to defeat most heroes.

The Aspect of Bael looks like a 10-foot tall muscular humanoid with handsome bovine features. It has an impressive mane of bright red hair and a pair of bull horns on its head. Its skin is colored gold and its mouth is ridged with sharp teeth and fangs.

When engaging enemies, the Aspect of Bael unfortunately does not share its progenitor's natural ability to think a few steps ahead, measure the battlefield, and make tactical decisions. Instead, the Aspect prefers to wade into battle with its morningstar, only falling back to its spells and other abilities if hard-pressed.

# DESTRACHANS

### DESTRACHAN

Destrachans are cruel Underdark-dwelling creatures that look vaguely reptilian and move about like ten-feet long bipedal dinosaurs, but are actually quite intelligent and very sadistic. They normally hunt in packs, feeding on misery and taking pleasure in torturing their victims before going in for the kill.

Sightless Hunters. As underground creatures, destrachans have evolved to become naturally blind, relying more on their unmatched sense of hearing to navigate their surroundings and locate viable prey. They have a pair of sophisticated, three-part ears that can pinpoint a target's exact location more accurately than sight.

Deadly Harmonics. What makes destrachans dangerous are their ability to emit flesh-rending sound waves. Their tubular maws can project carefully focused harmonics, producing sonic vibrations so powerful it can literally shatter objects and barriers. Their tough scaly hide has naturally evolved as well to become resistant to their own harmonics, as well as other thunder-based attacks.

3. Shatter. Each non-magical object that isn't worn in that area takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage.

### DESTRACHAN PACK LORD

Destrachans that were physically more superior and vicious than others eventually bully their way to the top and get the choicest meals. They eventually grow to a huge size and become the natural alphas of the pack and the only ones that can breed with the females. Extremely cunning, they are able to lead other destrachan to make coordinated attacks.

# DIRE CORBIES

### DIRE CORBY

These denizens of the Underdark look like a dark skinned, humanoid crow, with muscular arms ending in hooked claws. Dire Corbies are flightless omnivorous predators that have a greater preference for meat. Although they have a measure of intelligence, these creatures have no societal structure and do not often use tools.

They nest in underground cliff-side caves and normally hunt their prey by leaping down from ceilings or overhangs to rend targets with their claws. When attacking as a pack, they turn into a savage frenzy and become nearly suicidal.

### DIRE CORBY ALPHA

Alphas are the natural leaders of the dire corby pack. Not only are they physically stronger and larger, dire corby alphas also developed an ear-splitting shriek that it uses constantly to distract and frighten enemies, giving their hunting pack an opening for a killing strike.

# DRACOLISKS

### DRACOLISK

The dreaded dracolisk is an extremely rare crossbreed between a dragon and a basilisk.

The dracolisk appears at first glance like a typical dragon, with its same chromatic skin and typical batlike wings. However, it has three pairs of legs that end with razor sharp claws.

Just like a dragon, the dracolisk has a breath weapon. What makes it more dangerous is its deadly ability to petrify opponents with its gaze just like a basilisk's.

Presented below are the stats of an ancient, adult, and voung dracolisk of the black dragon variety.

On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the dracolisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert it s eves again. If it looks at the dracolisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the dracolisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dracolisk's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6). The dracolisk exhales acid in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 58 (13d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

They fear and avoid frost giants, because the latter tend to capture young white dragons and use them as guards and scouts.

# DRAGONNES

### DRAGONNE

A dragonne is a very rare subspecies of dragon that appear to be a cross between a lion and a dragon. An adult dragonne is about 8 feet tall at the shoulder and has a 16-foot long body of a lion covered in either lion fur or dragon colored scales and sporting a pair of dragon wings.

Territorial Predators. Dragonnes live in the dense jungles and savannahs. They are very territorial creatures but will also often let out warning roars to scare would-be intruders. Those that do not take heed, however, become prey and are treated to the full brunt of the dragonne's roar, a thunderous rumble that weakens the body and the mind, allowing the dragonne to tear apart and rend its targets.

# DRAGONSPAWNS

### DRAGONSPAWNS

The deity Tiamat continuously seeks to escape its infernal prison and return to the Prime Material Plane. To that end, it has empowered its most gifted followers to create the Dragonspawn from various beasts and monstrous eggs. These spawns of Tiamat have a sliver of Tiamats' power and are born to spread chaos and destruction, and help prepare the deity's return.

Tiamat's Sentinels. Dragonspawn reach maturity in just a few years, never reaching sizes bigger than Large, and leave the nest to strike out on their own, preferring to stay in environments similar to those favored by their parents. They nest with other dragonspawn or even other races so long as they have the same objectives. They are normally found in the company of Tiamat's followers, such as the Cult of the Dragon and kobolds, often serving as guards.

All dragonspawn are loyal to Tiamat's cause and have adopted Tiamat's temperament when it comes to dealing with other races, which is to say they look down on all non-Dragons and they hate good-aligned Dragons with a vengeance.

### BLACKSPAWN STALKER

This nightmarish creature looks like a young black dragon whose body has bloated into a spiders' proportions. It has lost its wings and in exchange has two spinneret tails that weave webbing, six arachnid limbs and four pairs of eyes that glow a sickly yellow as it hunts for prey.

The blackspawn stalker prefers to live in temperate swamps or dark forests where they lay clutches of eggs in multiple locations to increase chances of hatching.

Ambush Hunter. The blackspawn stalkers is an expert trap hunter, spinning webs on the forest floor or the treetops to waylay unsuspecting wanderers with. It then spits caustic webbing at its prey to pin them down before lunging at them for a bite and bludgeoning them with its tails.

Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) acid damage and be restrained by webbing. A creature that starts its turn restrained takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 15 Strength check, escaping from the webbing on a success. The effect ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 10, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage and and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.

CHAPTER 1. BESTIARY

### BLACKSPAWN CRAWLER

The blackspawn crawler is the horrific combination of a monstrous centipede and a black dragon. It has the segmented multilegged body of a centipede, with the head, horns, and fins of a wingless black dragon. It lives underground beneath temperate swamps, forests, and ruins. It will head to the surface only to hunt for prey.

In combat, the blackspawn crawler will prioritize constricting a target so it can't escape. It then tries to finish it off with its poisonous bite, unless there are other targets to fend off. In which case, it will either use its acid breath or bite attacks against them.

### BLUESPAWN AMBUSHER

Ambushers are what blue dragons would look like when compressed into the shape of a badger. They stand 3 feet tall at the shoulder and measure 5 feet in length and width. Their blue-scaled body, which crackles with electricity, no longer have wings but have adapted to burrowing under the ground.

Ambushers prefer to live in deserts and hunt in packs, mainly by hiding under the sand to wait for prey to pass by.

### GREENSPAWN LEAPER

The greenspawn leaper resembles a 4-foot long wingless green dragon that has had its body streamlined for traveling among tree branches.

Arboreal Assassins. Leapers prefer to live in warm forests. They hunt alone or in groups by traversing across the treetops looking for prey on the ground. When they find a likely target they will ambush it by dropping down with a killing bite. As a last resort they will also emit a burst of poison gas that affects all adjacent targets. This is usually reserved for escape since the gas would ruin the flesh of the victim and render it inedible for the leapers.

### GREENSPAWN RAZORFIEND

The greenspawn razorfiend bears similarities to a green dragon but their winged forelimbs are not for flight but for combat as the wings act as slashing weapons.

Ambush Hunters. Greenspawn razorfiends live in warm forests or marshlands, hunting singly or in groups. They ambush prey by lurking underwater or in a thicket, leaping out to attack with their blade-like wings and ferocious bite.

Shock Troops. Razorfiends are often raised by Tiamat worshipers to act as vanguards in combat. Their primary means of utilization would be to release them ahead of their armies and take advantage of their bloodthirsty nature to wreak havoc on the opposing force, breaking their ranks.

### REDSPAWN FIREBELCHER

Redspawn firebelchers bears the resemblance of a red dragon with the body of a bull, their bulky bodies averaging at least 12 feet long. They are vicious, stupid brutes that will attack anything that isn't aligned with Tiamat.

Lava Lurkers. Redspawn firebelchers prefer to reside in volcanic areas, living solitary lives until mating season. They tend to laze around in rivers of lava until they become hungry, whereupon they intrude into nearby countrysides to eat their fill of meat. If there is prey nearby, they would hide just underneath the surface of the lava and slowly make their approach until the prey is within striking distance or within range of their firebelch, which is a glob of lava and intense flames that the firebelcher spits out.

Cultists of Tiamat and red dragons often use firebelchers as guards, placing them underneath low bridges that span lava-filled caverns and chambers.

### WHITESPAWN ICESKIDDER

Whitespawn Iceskidders resemble 11-foot long dragon-headed white lizards that have adapted to gliding over icy surfaces. Their forelimb-wings aren't used for flight but instead for adjusting their air resistance while they skim over the ice.

Iceskidders are at home anywhere there is frozen water. They roam the vicinity singly or in pairs looking for prey to hunt, often initiating attacks using their freezing breath to freeze victims in place before closing in to finish them off with a killing bite.

Followers of Tiamat sometimes use iceskidders as mounts or to pull sleds across frozen surfaces.

### AMBUSH DRAKE

Ambush drakes are often found in the service of Draconicspeaking creatures, such as kobolds and lizardfolk. They are either used as guards or as trackers.

Ambush Hunters. In the wild, ambush drakes hunt in packs, often dividing their numbers - one group to lie waiting in ambush while another to drive their prey to the ambush spot. Ambush drakes use a combination of its poisonous bite and slowing breath to immobilize their targets as the rest of the pack swoop in for the kill.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.

### RAGE DRAKE

Rage drakes resemble red dragons in large cat-like bodies. They are incredibly aggressive, strong, and vicious, pouncing savagely on prey. Those hardy enough to survive the initial attack have their bodies locked by the drake's bite and are violently ripped to shreds like ragdolls by its brutal worrying. Although extremely difficult to control and prone to bursts of anger, they are sometimes used as mounts by humanoid champions of Tiamat.

When faced against overwhelming odds or a tough foe, they use their powerful breath weapon - an acid breath so extremely potent that it can melt through a victim's armor.

Warlords and powerful spellcasters that are able to speak draconic can tame stone drakes and utilize them to protect their castles and dungeons from intruders.

Duergar Resilience. The duergar has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being charmed or paralyzed.

Spellcasting. The duergar is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following artificer spells prepared:

Cantrip (at will): fire bolt, mage hand, mending 1st level (4 slots): catapult, shield, thunderwave 2nd level (3 slots): see invisibility, scorching ray, shatter 3rd level (3 slots): fireball, flame arrows, wind wall

Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the duergar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### ACTIONS

Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). For 1 minute, the duergar magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the duergar is Large, doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the duergar lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.

Light Hammer. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one

target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

Heavy Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage.

Arcane Turret (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The duergar magically summons a Medium turret in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of it. The turret is a magical object that occupies its space and that has crablike legs. It has an AC of 18 and 60 hit points. It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 10 minutes. The duergar can dismiss it early as an action.

When the duergar summons the turret, it decides which type it is, choosing from the options listed below:

1. Flamethrower. The turret exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

2. Force Ballista. Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the turret, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the turret.

3. Defender. The turret emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it 1d8 + 3 temporary hit points.

On each of its turns, the duergar can take a bonus action to cause the turret to activate if it is within 60 feet of it. As part of the same action, the duergar can direct the turret to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space.

The duergar can use an action to command the turret to detonate if is within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the turret and forces each creature within 10 feet of it to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The duergar magically turns invisible until it attacks, casts a spell, or uses its Enlarge, or until its concentration is broken, up to 1 hour (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is invisible with it.

### DUERGAR BATTLE SMITH

A duergar battle smith is an artificer who can create and command constructs, known as iron defenders, in battle. The iron defender would often resemble a mechanical spider that can inject poison with its bite. Together, the battle smith and iron defender form a potent team that can prove challenging to a low level party of adventurers.

In combat, the iron defender shares the duergar's initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after the duergar.

### DUERGAR HEAVY SNIPER

Duergar heavy snipers are experts at the use of the heavy crossbow, which is evident in the speed that they demonstrate when reloading what others may regard as a slow and cumbersome weapon. Excellent sharpshooters, heavy snipers can kill targets with just one shot from greater distances, even when the targets are partially hidden by cover.

# ELEMENTALS, ELDER

When pure elemental energies converge, a new elemental is created. This occasion, however, is extremely rare and only happen during catastrophic events that involve the elements. There are some situations, like that of the phoenix, where an elemental is reborn into a new body when its current one is weakened. Many theories other than the ones above persists, yet we will never know how these mysterious and powerful elementals came to be. One thing is for sure, young versions of elder elementals are more likelier to be encountered in their home planes than the older ones.

Presented below are variants of existing elder elementals.

### YOUNG LEVIATHAN

Young leviathans retain the same shape as their elder counterparts, albeit a tad smaller and less powerful. These massive serpent-like creatures roam the deepest seas, protecting its subjects. In its true form, a young leviathan can crush sea fortresses with its blows and sink battleships with a massive tidal wave. Fortunately, voung leviathans are rarely encountered, and only a fool-hardy simpleton would dare provoke it.

Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: + 11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (1d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) acid damage.

Tidal Wave (Recharge 6). While submerged, the leviathan magically creates a wall of water centered on itself. The wall is up 120 feet long, up to 120 feet high, and up to 20 feet thick. When the wall appears, all other creatures within its area must each make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. A creature takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At the start of each of the leviathan's turns after the wall appears, the wall, a long with any other creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from the leviathan. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or take 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage. A creature takes this damage no more than once on a turn. At the end of each turn the wall moves, the wall's height is reduced by 40 feet, and the damage creatures take from the wall on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the effect ends.

A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful DC 19 Strength (Athletics) check to swim at all during that turn.

### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The leviathan can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The leviathan regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Move. The leviathan moves up to its speed. Slam (Costs 2 Actions). The leviathan makes one slam attack.

### YOUNG PHOENIX

When a phoenix dies, or when it sees its powers dim, it can choose to die and be reborn anew. The young phoenix partially retains the wisdom of its former self, and gains a hot-headed temperament, eager to try its new-born powers in the world.

### YOUNG TEMPEST

Young tempests are born of the most powerful lightning storms, forming their serpent-like body alongside their "parent" until they are whole. Like their adult brethren, young tempests are temperamental, and are prone to unleashing torrential rains and punishing winds across all land it passes through.

### YOUNG ZARATAN

Zaratans are born from earthquakes and are about the size of a small hill when young. These dim-witted elementals only concern themselves with food, moving slowly across the terrain in search of the best territory. Young zaratans are normally overlooked since their carapace resemble the earth, complete with various types of flora. They are, however, very territorial and when provoked, can induce earthquakes and spew various debris from its mouth.

# FLAIL SNAIL

### MONSTROUS FLAIL SNAIL

A normal flail snail may grow to monstrous proportions if left alone to consume everything it comes across. The monstrous flail snail, which can grow three times the size of its kind, is a threat to hamlets and small towns that unfortunately happen to be in its path.

The monstrous flail snail's tentacles are so powerful that it can stun a creature if it is struck by it multiple times in the same turn.

Antimagic Shell. The flail snail has advantage on saving throws against spells, and any creature making a spell attack against the flail snail has disadvantage on the attack roll. If the flail snail succeeds on its saving throw against a spell attack misses it, an additional effect might occur, as determined by rolling a d8:

1-2. If the spell affects an area or has multiple targets, it fails and has no effect. If the spell targets only the flail snail, it has no effect on the flail snail and is reflected back at the caster, using the spell slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster. 3-4. No additional effect.

5-6. The flail snail's shell converts some of the spell's energy into a burst of destructive force. Each creature within 30 feet of the flail snail must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d8 force damage per level of the spell on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

7-8. If Scintillating Shell has already been used, the flail snail's shell converts the spell's energy and recharges Scintillating Shell. Otherwise, reroll and ignore results of 7-8.

Flail Tentacles. The flail snail has five flail tentacles. Whenever the flail snail takes 25 damage or more on a single turn, one of its tentacles dies. If even one tentacle remains, the flail snail regrows all dead ones within ld4 days. If all its tentacles die, the flail snail retracts into its shell, gaining total cover, and it begins wailing, a sound that can be heard for 600 feet, stopping only when it dies 5d6 minutes later. Healing magic that restores limbs, such as the regenerate spell, can halt this dying process.

### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The flail snail makes as many Flail Tentacle attacks as it has flail tentacles, all against the same target. If a target is hit at least three times by Flail Tentacle attacks in the same turn, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the flail snail's next turn.

Flail Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

Scintillating Shell (Recharges 6). The flail snail's shell emits dazzling, colored light until the end of the flail snail's next turn. During this time, the shell sheds bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet, and creatures that can see the flail snail have disadvantage on attack rolls against it. In addition, any creature within the bright light and able to see the flail snail when this power is activated must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the light ends.

Shell Defense. The flail snail withdraws into its shell, gaining a +6 bonus to AC until it emerges. It can emerge from its shell as a bonus action on its turn.

# GOLEMS

### BONE GOLEM

A bone golem is a horrific combination of giant-sized skeleton parts magically bolted and sutured together to form a humanoid-shaped figure about 9-feet tall. It has for four massive skeletal arms, two of which hold giant-sized weapons.

> In combat, the bone golem fights like a brute, hacking at each foe with its weapons and pair of oversized clubbed arms. Against large groups, the skeletal construct can become a deadly machine, able to charge in a straight line and spin its upper body around at the same time, striking all targets within reach of its arms and weapons.

Bone golems are often created by necromancers to serve as guards and as an extra precaution against divine spellcasters that may be prepared against their undead armies.

Unlike other golems, however, a drolem has the same capabilities as a typical dragon, with the ability to fly and unleash dragon's breath.

### MUD GOLEM

Often mistaken for an earth elemental, the mud golem is a magical construct created for its amorphous nature and ability to appear as natural heaps of mud, making it ideal as inconspicuous guardians in outdoor settings, such as a wizard's courtyard or garden.

Sticky Body. A mud golem is a bane to weapon wielding foes as any melee weapon that strikes the construct's body can become stuck fast if the attacker is not strong enough to pull it back out. Any creature caught by the golem's powerful limbs will soon find themselves getting smothered to death within the mud golem's body.

# GRAY RENDERS

### DISPLACER RENDER

Displacer renders are said to be the result of twisted experiments of combining a gray render and a displacer beast by wizards employed by the Unseelie court. Whatever reasons they may have were never uncovered.

The gray render retains its form but is now covered in bluish-black fur with two tentacles sprouting from its back. With the gray render's powerful rage-fueled attacks, and the displacer's natural light bending abilities, the threat level of this monster is taken to an entirely new level.

These gray renders are incredibly aggressive and will return attacks as long as it is able. In addition, it can unleash a deafening roar that can drain the courage of even the mightiest warriors, rendering them nearly incapacitated for the gray render to rip apart.

### YOUNG GRAY RENDER

Young gray renders are created from nodules that burst from the bodies of adult gray renders. They will be abandoned by their parents to fend for themselves, and some may form packs for the first few weeks in order to survive. Eventually, they will live solitary lives, consuming anything edible they come across, until they are mature enough to bond with an intelligent being.

# HAGS

### ELDER ANNIS HAG

The elder annis hag has lived for centuries, prolonging her unnatural life by preying on children and young virgins unnoticed, growing stronger and more powerful. She rarely steps out of from her lair deep within the dark forests of a high mountain, sending only her minions, such as hill giants, ogres, and trolls, to descend on nearby villages and towns to capture victims she can torment and later feed on.

The elder annis hag has performed enough evil deeds to secure ties with a dark deity, such as Cegilune. She has become the deity's champion and agent, and has been gifted divine abilities to continue her sinister work.

Despairing Cackle (Recharge 5-6). Each creature within 30 feet of the annis and able to hear the annis must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 20 (4d8 + 2) psychic damage, drop whatever it is holding, and become frightened for one minute. While frightened in this way, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the annis by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the Dash action.

### ELDER BHEUR HAG

The elder hag has acquired immeasurable power throughout centuries, maintaining its life unnaturally by feasting on mortals. It now wields an elder graystaff, a more powerful version of her previous staff, which allows her to cast more spells.

Elder Graystaff Magic. The hag carries a graystaff, a length of gray wood that is a focus for her inner power. She can ride the staff as if it were a broom of flying. While holding the staff, she can cast additional spells with her Innate Spellcasting trait (these spells are marked with an asterisk). If the staff is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a day. Only a bheur hag can use a graystaff.

Ice Walk. The hag can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost her extra movement.

Each creature of the hag's choice that is within 60 feet of her and able to see her must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of her for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the DM controls the creature's movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours.

Numbing Cackle (Recharge 5-6). The hag makes a chilling cackle. Each creature that isn't immune to cold within 30 feet of the hag and able to hear the hag must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target becomes vulnerable to cold, its speed is halved, it can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The effects last for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

# HEADLESS HORSEMAN

### HEADLESS HORSEMAN

No one truly knows where the legendary headless horseman came from. It is commonly said though that the creature first rose from the decapitated corpse of a disgraced knight that was animated by a night hag. As part of the ritual to bind it in servitude, the corpse's head is kept and hidden by the animator. What rises is an evil undead creature imbued with the spirit of vengeance and destruction. The headless horseman is a relentless avenger that will tirelessly hunt its target. The headless horseman retains the armor it wore in life, sans the helm. In place of its head is a jack o' lantern that burns with abyssal fire.

Relentless Avenger. The headless horseman can be summoned or controlled by its animator as long as it keeps possession of the head. While the horseman is bound in servitude, it must follow the commands of its animator without question. A headless horseman that regains possession of its head will immediately attack its animator until it is slain. If there are others creatures the horseman still needs to seek vengeance on, it will seek them out and kill them. Only after all are dead will it finally return to rest.

For traps placed on a surface, the trap is triggered when a surface within the area is touched or stepped on, removing another object covering it, or manipulating an object that holds it. For traps within an object, the trap is triggered when the object is opened or manipulated.

When the kobold lays a trap, it chooses from one of the following options below for its effect. Once triggered, each creature within 5 feet of the trap is targeted by its effect, unless specified otherwise.

1. Bear Trap. This trap can only be placed on a ground surface and only the creature that triggered it as affected. The target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (4d4) piercing damage and is restrained. The creature can make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to escape the trap. If the check fails, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage. Until the creature regains all of its hit points, its walking speed is reduced by half.

2. Flare Blast. Each target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute.

3. Explosive Blast. Each target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage and 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

4. Poison Gas. Each target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute.

5. Stink Cloud. The trap creates a 10-foot radius sphere of green, nauseating gas centered on the trap which lasts for 1 minute. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each target within the cloud must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after I round.

# KRUTHIKS

### KRUTHIK HIVE OUEEN

The kruthik hive queen is the overall master of all hives within its territory, and is always attended to by 2-3 hive lords. It very rarely leaves its main lair, preferring to stay within the hive as it spends its time laying and watching over its eggs and commanding its hive lords to manage its territory.

Battle Mistress. If forced into battle, the hive queen can become a terrifying opponent. Like hive lords, it can stab with its razorsharp forelimbs, shoot iron-like spikes, or spew horrific amounts of acid. In addition to these weapons, the hive queen can also unleash its terrible tail stinger, which can instantly paralyze a creature hit. The hive queen is also a shrewd tactician, able to call other kruthiks to its side, or direct them to attack specific targets of its choosing.

### OGRE WERERAT

Normally only humanoids can be afflicted with lycanthropy. However, there have been a few rare cases where giants, for some unknown reason or fluke, become cursed after suffering a bite from a werecreature. The ogre wererat is such an example. To the ogre, the curse has become a gift. The transformation has given it more resistance and stamina, acute senses, cunning, and agility. Unfortunately, it now also has an insatiable appetite for flesh.

An ogre wererat can sometimes be found in the company of other wererats and serves as their muscle.

# MAUR (HUNCHED GIANT)

### MAUR (HUNCHED GIANT)

Maurs, also known as hunched giants, are rumored to be the devolved cousins of Storm Giants that have been trapped millions of years ago deep in the Underdark. The harsh, cramped, and tight spaces of subterranean life has transformed them into hunched, stoop-shouldered caricatures of their former greatness and their skin and hair pasty white. Unless there is actual space to stand up, these 15-foot tall giants are always hunched over and scraping their knuckles on the floor.

Unfurled Might. Maurs are armed with stone-mail and stone weapons, and they decorate their skin by scarring glyphs onto it. They typically set up ambush by melding into stone, wait for their intended targets to pass by them, before launching an assault with their stone warhammer. If faced with difficult foes and there is a large enough space in the area, they can unfurl, stretch, and stand in a process that can be seen as intensely painful. Once fully upright, the Maurs are better able to leverage their strength and spell capabilities to their maximum potential. Due to their evolved physiology however, they are unable to maintain an upright position for a long period of time and must return to their hunched form as soon as they can.

Symbiotic Giants. Maurs are only encountered in the Underdark, and unless forced, never leave it. They are very rarely encountered in large groups, and, due to the challenges they have with their size, they work and create symbiotic relationships with smaller intelligent races such as duergar, grimlocks, svirfneblin, and troglodytes to serve as guards in exchange for food and treasure.

Creature Sense. The elder brain is aware of the presence of creatures within 2 miles of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each creature's Intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.

Innate Spellcasting (Psionics). The elder brain's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 20). The elder brain can innately cast the following spells, without providing material components:

At will: detect thoughts, levitate, shield 3/day each: dominate monster, telekinesis 1/day each: plane shift, psychic scream

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the elder brain fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Resistance. The elder brain has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Telepathic Hub. The elder brain can use its telepathy to initiate and maintain telepathic conversations with up to ten creatures at a time. The elder brain can let those creatures telepathically hear each other while connected in this way.

### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The elder brain makes two tentacle attacks.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 40 ft., one creature. Hit: 28 (5d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Huge or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 16) and and takes 15 (2d8 + 6) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns until the grapple ends. The elder brain can have up to four targets grappled at a time.

Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6). The elder brain magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or take 39 (6d10 + 6) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Psychic Link. The elder brain targets one incapacitated creature it can perceive with its Creature Sense trait and establises a psychic link with that creature. Until the psychic link ends, the elder brain can perceive everything the target senses. The target becomes aware that something is linked to its mind once it is no longer incapacitated, and the elder brain can terminate the link at any time (no action required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the psychic link, doing so with a successful DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage. The psychic link also ends if the target and the elder brain are more than 5 miles apart, with no consequences to the target. The elder brain can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time.

Sense Thoughts. The elder brain targets a creature with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain gains insight into the target's reasoning, its emotional state, and thoughts that loom large in its mind (including things the target worries about, loves, or hates}. The elder brain can also make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage to deceive the target's mind into thinking it believes one idea or feels a particular emotion. The target contests this attempt with a Wisdom (Insight) check. If the elder brain succeeds, the mind believes the deception for 1 hour or until evidence of the lie is presented to the target.

Psionic Hub. If an elder brain establishes a psychic link with the ulitharid, the elder brain can form a psychic link with any other creature the ulitharid can detect using its Creature Sense.

The ulitharid can maintain its psychic link with the elder brain regardless of the distance between them, so long as they are both on the same plane of existence. If the ulitharid is more than 5 miles away from the elder brain, it can end the psychic link at any time (no action required).

### REACTIONS

Misdirection. When the ulitharid is targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of it is granting it cover against that attack, it can have the attack target that creature instead.

### ULITHARID MASTERMIND

An ulitharid mastermind is an extremely brilliant tactician, schemer, and manipulator. It does its work behind the scenes, secretly instructing its minions and underlings to do the dirty, hands-on tasks, while also influencing other powerful beings, such as other ulitharid and illithids, to work towards its goals, knowingly or unknowingly.

Paranoid Schemer. Due to its nature, an ulitharid mastermind is very careful in its actions, for fear that the elder brain will find it a threat, and end its life early. Because of this, it is very paranoid and tends to get rid of any loose ends, consuming their brains to leave no trace of evidence that the elder brain might discover.

### ULITHARID SUPREME

The most powerful ulitharid is given the title of Supreme and acts as the right hand of the illithid colony's elder brain. It rarely leaves the safety of its colony, preferring to act as the ulitharid's leader in an administrative function.

If it does have to leave, it is always accompanied by a couple of lesser ulitharids and more than a dozen illithid bodyguards. However, this is more for show than necessity, as the ulitharid supreme is very capable of defending itself, even against powerful foes, such as high level adventurers or giths.

Constant Threat. Despite how loyal it is to the elder brain, the ulitharid supreme knows that it has grown too much in power and will be recognized as a threat by the elder brain and its minions. It will thus prepare for contingencies, either to escape and break off from the colony, or to destroy and replace the elder brain as the colony's new leader.

These failed ilithids experience the struggle for survival the moment they are born, having to escape the clutches of adult mind flayers that seek to eliminate it.

# NIGHTSHADE

Nightshades are extremely powerful undead creatures that seek to destroy all life. They are native to the Negative Plane and occassionally can also be found lurking in the Shadowfell. The dreaded Nightwalker is a type of Nightshade.

Undead Nature. All nightshades don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

In this section, three other nightshades are introduced: the nightcrawler, nightprowler, and the nightwing.

### NIGHTCRAWLER

A nightcrawler at first glance resembles a nightmarish purple worm, but is jet black in color and oozes an insidious presence. It is in fact one of the mightiest undead creatures that ever existed. Its giant coiled body constantly emits a shadowy aura that causes living organisms to rot and decay.

Ambush Burrowers. The nightcrawler normally burrows underground and attacks from underneath its prey. Its huge maw, which is lined with rows of long, sharp teeth, bursts from the ground and tries to swallow its target whole. Creatures rarely survive this initial horrific assault, and those that do still have to contend with the nightcrawler's finger of doom and annihilating aura.

Each time the target takes necrotic damage, it must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.

If the nightcrawler takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the nightcrawler must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the nightcrawler. If the nightcrawler dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Finger of Doom (Recharge 6). The nightcrawler chooses one creature it can see within 300 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or take 32 (5d12) necrotic damage and become frightened until the end of the nightcrawler's next turn.

The nightprowler resembles a creature that has a vaguely humanoid upper body and a lower body of a large feline. It has a single eve at the center of its otherwise featureless face, and shadowy mist-like tendrils constantly swirl around its body.

### NIGHTWING

A nightwing resembles a giant shadowy bat with wingspan of 40 feet. Black mists can be seen trailing from its body as it scours the skies of the Negative Plane constantly looking for prey.

The nightwing attacks by performing hit and run tactics,

swooping in to make a quick bite and flying again before giving the victim a chance to retaliate.

# NILBOG, GREATER

### GREATER NILBOG

It is already known that when goblinoids form a host, there is a chance that a goblin will become possessed by a nilbog. However, when a particular goblin jester has suffered greatly under the hands of other goblinoids, there is a small chance that a far deadlier and more sinister spirit possesses the goblin.

Unlike the typical nilbog, this greater version has more potent spell-like abilities and is able to control foes that it has charmed and sometimes even have them fully take an attack intended against the greater nilbog.

# OGRES

### OGRE CHAMPION OF GROLANTOR

There are a few ogres that worship Grolantor, seeing themselves as equals to hill giants. For some unknown reason, the deity seems to listen to their prayers. Their champions are able to magically emit a roar that is terrifying to any who are considered 'lesser' to them. This means any human or beast that is smaller than an ogre.

### OGRE VANGUARD

Very few ogres are trained to wear armor heavier than hide. An ogre vanguard is one of those few. Often found in hobgoblin armies, this ogre can be seen in the front lines, bellowing and grunting as it tries to grab its enemies attention. It then charges and barrels itself into the enemy ranks, cleaving through bodies with its greatsword. Those that dare to run away or disengage from it are met with quick, punishing strikes.

CHAPTER 1. BESTIARY

### ORC CONQUEROR

Very few orcs become champions of their tribes. And fewer still ever become unholy knights that serve their deities. These are the exceptional ones that have survived countless battles and many tests, and have been honed to become merciless tyrants who lead their orcish kin to raid and destroy enemy settlements in the name of their gods.

Frightful Weapons. Blessed and favored by their deities, these conquerors can unleash divine spells and imbue their weapons with necrotic energy to smite their foes with. Any creature hit by their weapons are stricken with fear, and are unable to move away from the orc due to its supernatural aura.

Conquerors are most likely the overall leaders of any orc tribe. If not, they believe they certainly will be.

The orc doesn't see it as a curse though, and welcomes it as its true natural state of a Hand of Yurtrus.

### ORC KING

The mighty orc king is a striking figure, garbed in plate armor and armed with a greatsword. It rides into battle on its personal war beast - often a large dire wolf or boar - commanding its horde to unleash hell's fury on its enemies. Its presence alone can rally nearby orcs in battle. However, the orc king is not just a potent commander. It is a mighty and savage warrior that can attack thrice with its weapon, and emit battle cries that can turn its allies into a battle frenzy, or strike fear into the hearts of its enemies.

### ORC VANGUARD

Most orcs prefer to wear light or medium armor and frown at wearing heavy armor as it feels restrictive. An orc vanguard, however, sees it as a necessity to be able to deflect most blows that might hit. This is an inevitability as the orc vanguard's role is to be at the frontline of a charging army and attract the enemy's attention away from its more vulnerable allies.

Orc sharpshooters are highly skilled archers with deadly aim. Thankfully, only a few orcs attain this level of skill with the bow.

### ORC WAR CHANTER

Very rarely do orcs learn the bardic arts, but those that do almost always become war chanters. While they can still fight savagely as most orc warriors, their true worth shines when they perform their war chants during battle. These war chants enable them to either strike fear to any enemy that can hear it, inspire allies to a battle frenzy, or rally its allies.

### THE GRIM

The embodiment of hopelessness and despair, the Grim is among the mightiest of the Sorrowsworn that can be found in the Shadowfell.

Creatures unfortunate enough to be within range will hear it, even in their minds. The Grim can then choose to fill their thoughts either of extreme sorrow, deep emptiness, or memories of past losses and regret.

The worm is a Tiny undead with AC 6, 1 hit point, a 2 (-4) in every ability score, and a speed of 1 foot. While on the target's skin, the worm can be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use this action to launch a scraped-off worm at a humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, the worm burrows under the target's skin at the end of the target's next turn, dealing 1 piercing damage to it. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum of 10d6). A worm-infested target dies if it drops to 0 hit points, then rises 10 minutes later as a spawn of Kyuss. If a worm-infested creature is targeted by an effect that cures disease or removes a curse, all the worms infesting it wither away.

### TWO-HEADED TROLL

It is not exactly sure how the two-headed trolls came to be. Some say it is due to a troll crossbreeding with an ettin. Others say that it is because the troll ate another troll, and the head of the eaten troll had grown back and merged into the body of the consumer. This is unlikely as well, as such a troll is said to be a dire troll, which is an entirely different species and doesn't share the same qualities. Whatever the case may be, such a troll appears to be considered by its kin as a boon from Vaprak.

In combat, it serves as primary support to its allies, either through the use of healing and enhancement spells, or spells that wreak havoc on enemy ranks, such as call lightning and erupting earth.

When forced into melee, the troll witch doctor is still a dangerous foe, as its claws and teeth can still tear a man into pieces.

# VARGOUILLES

Not all vargouilles are created equal. The most common vargouilles are created from the humanoid races. Some vargouilles are created from the heads of other species, and have resulted in a different species of vargouilles.

### DIRE VARGOUILLE

In most cases, the fiendish curse from a vargouille can only affect a humanoid. In very rare instances, however, the curse may affect beasts and monstrosities, especially if the target was assaulted by a swarm of vargouille. When the transformation occurs, the resulting creature is that of dire vargouille - a stronger, more lethal specimen of the original.

### GREATER VARGOUILLE

Greater vargouille are extremely rare, which happens when a giant undergoes the gruesome transformation after being infected by a vargouille's kiss. These horrid creatures are nearly 3 to 4 feet height in length, have wingspans 10 feet wide, and are able to exhale poisonous vapors that can make creatures violently sick.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage and the target can't regain hit points until the start of the vargouille's next turn.

Kiss. The vargouille kisses one incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target loses l point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a daylight spell. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting remove curse, greater restoration, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse.

Stunning Shriek. The vargouille shrieks. Each humanoid and beast within 30 feet of the vargouille and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the vargouille's next turn. While frightened in this way, a target is stunned. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Stunning Shriek of all vargouilles for l hour.

Kiss. The vargouille kisses one incapacitated giant or humanoid within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target loses 1 point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a daylight spell. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting remove curse, greater restoration, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse.

Stunning Shriek. The vargouille shrieks. Each giant, humanoid, and beast within 30 feet of the vargouille and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the vargouille's next turn. While frightened in this way, a target is stunned. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Stunning Shriek of all vargouilles for l hour.

Horrid Breath (Recharge 5-6). The vargouille exhales nauseating vapor in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the target can't regain hit points and spends its action during its turn retching and reeling. A poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.

Clever Bullies. Verbeeg are clever and are rarely encountered alone. They often bully and take charge of less intelligent groups of giant-kin such as ogres, hill giants, and trolls, and forcing and manipulating them to do the heavy lifting - such as fighting, as they stay behind relative safety.

Verbeeg often establish lairs in underground caves, dungeons, and abandoned castles. They mostly worship the evil giant gods, such as Grolantor and Vaprak. Among its leaders and unique warriors are the chieftain, the shaman, the skirmisher, and the priest of Grolantor. Presented below are the stat blocks for each.

# WENDIGO

### WENDIGO

A wendigo is a dreadful fev spirit that haunts cold temperate forests and desolate tundras. It is often mistaken for an undead or lycanthrope due to its appearance and its insatiable craving for humanoid flesh.

Bestial Horror. The wendigo appears as a gaunt horrid-looking 9-foot tall humanoid with an emaciated elk's head with antlers. Its foul body is covered with dark matted hair that is stained with blood. Its unnaturally long arms end in vicious claws and its mouth is ridged with sharp teeth.

Ravenous Spirit. The wendigo was once an evil humanoid that hunted and preyed on its own kind, surviving as a cannibal for most of its life while living alone in the wilderness. Such a creature will attract the attention of the Queen of Air and Darkness or Malar the Beastlord. Before the creature's death, the deity it gained favor from bestows upon it a gift, or rather a curse, which transforms the creature into the ravenous wendigo. This allows the creature to continue what it did in its previous life, for eternity.

Keen Hearing and Smell. The wendigo has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

Innate Spellcasting. The wendigo's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). The wendigo can innately cast the following spells, without providing material components:

At will: chill touch (3d8), dancing lights, detect magic 1/day each: greater invisibility, wind walk (self only).

Maddening Whispers. As a bonus action, the wendigo chooses one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, or it takes 13 (2d8 + 4) psychic damage and must use its reaction to move up to half its speed and make a melee weapon attack against one creature of the wendigo's choice that the wendigo can see.

Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. While poisoned, the target's Wisdom score is reduced by 1d4 at the start of each of its turns. This reduction will not cause a target's score to go below 3. When a target's Wisdom reaches a score of 3, it becomes insane and ravenous. While in this state, the creature acts as an ally of the wendigo, gains a bite attack (1d6 piercing damage), and must spend its action each turn making a bite attack against an enemy of the wendigo.

The Wisdom score reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage.

Gore. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage.

Baleful Howl. The wendigo emits a terrifying howl. Every enemy within 300 feet of the wendigo that can hear it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target that starts its turn within 30 feet of the wendigo must use all its movement on that turn to get as far from the wendigo as possible, must finish the move before taking an action, and must take the most direct route, even if hazards lie that way. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A target that successfully saves is immune to the wendigo's baleful howl for the next 24 hours.

It trusts no one, not even its advisers, and for good reason. Xvarts by nature are so greedy they can't stop themselves from scheming and finding opportunities to usurp their leader and steal.

# YUGOLOTHS, GUARDIAN

### GUARDIAN YUGULOTHS

Guardian vugoloths are mercenary vugoloths that specialize in defense and protection. They have unnaturally alert senses and are quick to punish any who may attack their wards. They are normally hired by other fiends as bodyguards or guards, but they can also be summoned by evil priests and wizards who are in need of their services.

Guardian yugoloths come in different forms and appearances, but the three most common ones are featured in here: the gorsuloth, ranaeloth, and the ursaloth.

### GORSULOTH

The gorsuloth looks like a 10-foot tall gorilla with dull black fur. curving horns sprouting from its head, pointed ears, fanged maw and over-sized forearms.

Arcane Turret (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The artillerist magically summons a Medium turret in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of it. The turret is a magical object that occupies its space and that has crablike legs. It has an AC of 18 and 65 hit points. It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 10 minutes. The artillerist can dismiss it early as an action.

When the artillerist summons the turret, it decides which type it is, choosing from the options listed below:

1. Flamethrower. The turret exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites

any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. 2. Force Ballista. Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the turret, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the turret.

3. Defender. The turret emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it 8 (1d8 + 4) temporary hit points.

On each of its turns, the artillerist can take a bonus action to cause the turret to activate if it is within 60 feet of it. As part of the same action, the artillerist can direct the turret to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space.

The artillerist can use an action to command the turret to detonate if is within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the turret and forces each creature within 10 feet of it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

### CULTISTS OF ASMODEUS

The Cult of Asmodeus is the largest and most feared of the diabolical cults. While other cults may worship different archdevils, they must still acknowledge Asmodeus as the supreme leader that holds power over them.

Power and Wealth. Although the cult may have fiendish and monstrous members, majority of its sects are secretly located in civilized human cities and a few from the other fair races. Those who join the cult mostly use the membership to take advantage of the Cult's political reach and deep resources to gain wealth and power. As such, a large number of members are local politicians, merchants, and noblemen.

Shrewd Negotiators. However, some do join in hopes of following the ideology of Asmodeus and become priests. Like Asmodeus, the cultists see themselves cut above the rest, and are often regarded by others as arrogant, cruel, and elitist. But despite these negative qualities, majority of their membership are very sharp, intuitive, and very skillful diplomats, forming secret alliances and lucrative trade deals with various organizations, legitimate or not. They have been mostly successful due to their ability to use Dominance of Nessus, as well as their array of coercive spells. If they encounter a threat or problem, they rarely act on it themselves. Instead, they use or leverage other individuals, organizations, or cults to take care of it.

Their humanoid members are comprised of mostly bandits, thugs, and social outcasts They do have two common sets of attributes - all share some form of deformity and a level of deranged sociopathy. Most, if not all, are psychopaths.

Double Headed. Each coven is often led by two heads, each symbolizing demogorgon's twin heads, Aameul and Hathradiah. These two heads lead separate groups, each with their own objectives. They clash with each other as often as they cooperate together. While their methods are not efficient, the horrific trail of bodies they leave sow chaos and fear in most civilized lands.

### CULTISTS OF MEPHISTOPHELES

Centuries ago Mephistopheles discovered and harnessed hellfire, a new magical fiery substance of his design. He has since abandoned it for other projects, but his cultists continued to use the name for its members.

Knowledge Collectors. Majority of the cult's members are mages, sages, and scholars that seek long-lost or forbidden knowledge that they normally can't access themselves. The members work tirelessly to accumulate such knowledge, and scheme to acquire more. When news of an important discovery reaches them - such as finding an ancient set of elven ruins or a legendary archmage's tomb, the cult mobilizes immediately and sends its cadre of hellfire disciples and stewards to get to the location and deal with anyone that would challenge them from plundering the place.

### CULTISTS OF ORCUS

Of all of the demon lords of the Abyss, Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undeath, claims the largest amount of followers. It has therefore spawned scores of cults with diversified objectives, but all fall under three major doctrines.

Necromantic Practitioners. The first one is mastery of necromancy, which is the most common type of cult of Orcus. Members of this type of cult are mages and priests who seek power over mortality, utilizing undead minions to further their goals and aspirations.

Undead Master Race. The second doctrine is the support of undeath or power over the living. Majority of its members are undead themselves and seek to add more to its ranks while those who live use the remainder of their mortal lives to infiltrate and set up shop in major cities to establish a steady source of fresh bodies. Members of these types of cults are undead that require sustenance, knowledge, or the arts, such as vampires and liches, and other intelligent undead.

Insane Nihilists. The third most common doctrine is the true goal of Orcus, which is to seek an end to all life in the cosmos, replacing the living with undead who serve only him. Cult members of this type are mostly insane, deranged, and suicidal. Those that work in large groups carry out mass murders, attacking small villages and hamlets, while those that work in smaller groups or individually, operate like serial killers and hide in plain sight within bustling and thriving cities.

Deathpriests. Majority of divine spellcasters who worship Orcus, no matter the doctrine, call themselves deathpriests. Blessed by the Prince of Undeath, they are able to cast necromantic spells that are normally only available to arcane spellcasters.

# APPENDIX C: NEW SPELLS

### UNHOLY AURA

8th-level abjuration

Casting Time 1 action Range self

Components V, S, M (a tiny reliquary worth at least 1000 gp containing a sacred relic, such as a scrap of cloth from a saint's robe or a piece of parchment from an unholy text) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute.

Necrotic energy slithers out from you and coalesces in a dark essence in a 30-foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this spell are enshrouded in shadowy tendrils and have advantage on all saving throws against spells cast by good-aligned creatures and creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when an attacker hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or the attacker's Strength score is reduced by 1d4. The attacker dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a Short or Long rest.

# UNHOLY WEAPON

5th-level evocation

Casting Time 1 bonus action Range Touch Components V. S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour.

You imbue a weapon you touch with unholy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon shimmers with a dark, pulsating purplish aura. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration. As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of necrotic energy. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage, and gains 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

# WALL OF IRON

5th-level evocation

Casting Time 1 action Range 120 feet Components V, S, M (A piece of sheet iron plus gold worth 50 gp)

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes.

A nonmagical wall of solid slone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with alleast one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-10-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the

size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object made of iron that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 18 and 60 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to O hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion. lf you maintain your concentralion on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.

# ABOUT THIS BOOK

Character Options: Talents offers variant rules for your 5th edition gaming. It does not change any of the existing rules. Instead, it provides you additional options for character development. It contains over 200 talents to choose from that you can use to customize your character and make them more unique, specialized, and dynamic.

The 5th edition core rules have been an amazing set, but it has left me a little more wanting in character options. In particular, the Feats and character archetypes. Do not get me wrong; they are both well written, balanced, and fun. However, I would have liked to have been able to decide more on how I develop my character as I gained levels.

Character Options: Talents harkens back to the days of 3rd edition gaming where you always look forward to that extra feat you can acquire at 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter. The talents you will see within this book are like mini-feats. Most do not bring as many features as a standard feat. Instead, they either help shape and add flavor to your character, improve your specializations, or address your opportunities. You do not need to use all of them if you think some are not balanced. Feel free to modify them as you see fit. And most importantly, have fun!

# INTRODUCTION

# WHAT ARE TALENTS?

alents are extraordinary aspects of a character's abilities, background, personality, physique, proficiencies, and features. Thev are similar to, but not always as powerful as, standard Feats. They offer a means for you to improve your current existing abilities, slightly or temporarily shift game mechanics into your favor, provide you with a new capability, or build your character's background and personality for a richer roleplaying experience.

# ACQUIRING TALENTS

▼ ach character begins with one talent at 1st level. At 3rd level and every three levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th), they gain another talent. Talents are gained according to character level, regardless of individual class levels.

You can only acquire a specific talent once. However, certain talents can be retaken more than once as detailed in their description.

You may also choose not to acquire a talent when you reach a level where you are eligible to do so. You can save this acquisition for later on (perhaps when you have met the prerequisites).

If you do not wish to use the variant rules of acquiring talents, you can instead just acquire them as Half Feats. Each time you are eligible to take a new Feat, you can opt to select two Talents instead.

# PREREQUISITES

ome talents have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class level, faction, feature, feat, race, skill, or other quality designated in order to select or use that talent.

You cannot use or gain the benefit of a talent if vou lose the prerequisite.

# TYPES OF TALENTS

ome talents are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are racial, which means that those talents are only available to members of that race. Faction talents are talents which only members

of their faction are allowed to have. Finally, there are class talents. These comprise the majority of the talents, and most have specific class level requirements.

# GAME BALANCE

he introduction of talents may result in some game imbalance issues in favor of the plavers.

To address this, you can use some or all of the following options:

• Reduce the starting total ability scores of players by 2-4 and/or set a maximum starting ability score of 14 after racial bonuses.

· Assign talents to NPCs or even humanoid monsters. As a standard, monsters can have one talent for every three CR they have plus one, rounded down. Class talents can also be applied to monsters who have classes or class-like features. The book DM Options: Monster Talents extensively provides more details about providing talents to monsters.

· Increase the average level of the party by 1 for every 3 levels when calculating CR.

# THE TALENTS

# TALENT DESCRIPTIONS

"Better than the first! Wowee this book has every monster I have ever wanted that wasn't covered in the official Monster Manual plus heaps more. Up to par with the official 5e books, if not better in some places. Full art, and over 300 pages. An absolute tome! Personal favorite: The Grim."

"For content here ... the amount you're getting ... I have to give this 5 out of 5."

"As with the first volume, this is very well conceived and equally well executed. It is well written and concise... and features plenty of well chosen, quality examples of artwork throughout. including a lot of new and original pieces"
