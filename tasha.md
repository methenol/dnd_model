#### ON THE ALT-COVER

Artist Wylie Beckert shows Tasha conjuring images of her past and future, wielding an incantation taught by her mother, Baba Yaga, while the abyssal lord Graz'zt looks on.

Disclaimer: Contained herein are the observations of the archmage Tasha. Later known as the Witch Queen and then Iggwilv, she is one of the greatest wizards in the history of the multiverse. We fear there is an incantation hidden within these notes and have therefore bound this tome with powerful wards. If you are reading this, the first ward has already been broken! If you dare read any further, we cannot guarantee the safety of your soul or that you won't open a portal to another plane of existence. If a portal does appear, pray
that nothing worse than Tasha's mother Baba Yaga appears. And if the mother of hags rives, be sure to offer only praises of her daughter. Or offer muffins. She loves muffins.

### USING THIS BOOK

Tasha's Cauldron of Everything offers a host of new options for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, and our journey through those options is accompanied by the notes of the wizard Tasha. Creator of the spell Tasha's hideous laughter, Tasha's life is one of the most storied in the D&D multiverse. Raised by Baba Yaga, the Mother of Witches herself. Tasha adventured across the world of Greyhawk and became the friend and sometimes enemy of other famous adventurers, like Mordenkainen. In time, she ruled as the Witch Queen and later changed her name to Iggwilv-a figure of legend who is whispered about, feared, and admired.

Written for players and Dungeon Masters alike, this book offers options to enhance characters and campaigns in any D&D world, whether you're adventuring in Greyhawk, another official D&D setting, or a world of your own creation.

### WHAT YOU'LL FIND WITHIN

- Chapter 1 brims with new features and subclasses for the classes in the Player's Handbook, and it presents the artificer class, a master of magical invention. The chapter also offers feats for groups that use them.
- Chapter 2 contains patrons who can become one of the driving forces behind your group's adventures.
- Chapter 3 sparkles with new magical options, including spells, magical spellbooks, artifacts, and magic-infused tattoos-available for both player characters and monsters to use.
- Chapter 4 holds various rules that a DM may incorporate into a campaign, including rules on sidekicks who level up with the player characters and on supernatural environments. The chapter ends with a collection of puzzles ready to be deployed in any adventure that the DM would like to spice up with some puzzling.

### IT'S ALL OPTIONAL

Everything in this book is optional. Each group, guided by the DM, decides which of these options, if any, to incorporate into a campaign. You can use some, all, or none of them. We encourage you to choose the ones that fit best with your campaign's story and with your group's style of play.

Whatever options you choose to use, this book relies on the rules in the Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, and Dungeon Master's Guide, and it can be paired with the options in Xanathar's Guide to Everything and other D&D books.

### UNEARTHED ARCANA

Much of the material in this book originally appeared in Unearthed Arcana, a series of online articles we publish to explore rules that might officially become part of the game. Some Unearthed Arcana offerings don't end up resonating with fans and are set aside. The Unearthed Arcana material that inspired the options in the following chapters was well received and, thanks to feedback from thousands of D&D fans, has been refined into the official forms presented here.

### TEN RULES TO REMEMBER

### 1. THE DM ADJUDICATES THE RULES

The rules of D&D cover many of the twists and turns that come up in play, but the possibilities are so vast that the rules can't cover everything. When you encounter something that the rules don't cover or if you're unsure how to interpret a rule, the DM decides how to proceed, aiming for a course that brings the most enjoyment to your whole group.

### 2. EXCEPTIONS SUPERSEDE GENERAL RULES

General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee weapon attacks use Strength and ranged weapon attacks use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn't explicitly say otherwise.

The game also includes elements-class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the likethat sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example. if a feature says you can make melee weapon attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.

### 3. ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE

Even if more than one factor gives you advantage or disadvantage on a roll, you have it only once, and if you have advantage and disadvantage on the same roll, they cancel each other.

### 4. REACTION TIMING

Certain game features let you take a special action, called a reaction, in response to an event. Making opportunity attacks and casting the shield spell are two typical uses of reactions. If you're unsure when a reaction occurs in relation to its trigger, here's the rule: the reaction happens after its trigger, unless the description of the reaction explicitly says otherwise. Once you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn.

### My dear, sweet, lucky reader,

You know me. You've heard of my exploits. You've spread my titles: Natasha the Dark, Hura of Ket, Baba Yaga's daughter, witch par exellence, and, if you're not trying to impress, just plain Tasha .

For longer than I care to confess, I've sought out mysteries and wonders that beggar description . (Well, wonders that beggar the descriptions of those not raised in an immortal's dancing hut, as I was . ) Within this tome, you'll find a sampling of the curiosities I've documented during my travels, including my exploits with the infamous Company of Seven; my studies with the original Mad Archmage, Zagia Yragerne; and my correspondences with world-hopping (and sanctimonious) luminaries like Mordenkainen. Unfortunately, at Mordenkainen's request, a panel of experts from the Greyhawk Guild of Wizardry-which I'm assured is an esteemed center of learning and not at all an elaborate scam to swindle highborn rubes-has been granted editorial oversight of this work. As a result, I understand that some of my "less traditional" findings have been saddled with various rules, for the supposed "safe continuance of the mystical arts and, indeed, all life in the multiverse. "

No matter. Through a combination of irrefutable arguments and spells, I've convinced the editorial board to furnish me with this advance copy of their work.

In reviewing it, I've added a variety of helpful marqinalia. I expect that-with the inclusion of my insights , quidance, threats, and critiques-clever minds will have all they need to advance their accounting of the multiverse's infinite audacities. And even if not, read on and maybe you'll learn something my archmage semipeers are terrified of you learning.

I'm drawing back the curtain of reality for you, reader dearest. Summon your courage, and take a peek.

### 5. PROFICIENCY BONUS

If your proficiency bonus applies to a roll, you can add the bonus only once to the roll, even if multiple things in the game say your bonus applies. Moreover, if more than one thing tells you to double or halve your bonus, you double it only once or halve it only once before applying it. Whether multiplied, divided, or left at its normal value, the bonus can be used only once per roll.

### 6. BONUS ACTION SPELLS

If you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 bonus action, remember that you can't cast any other spells before or after it on the same turn, except for cantrips with a casting time of 1 action.

### 7. CONCENTRATION

As soon as you start casting a spell or using a special ability that requires concentration, your concentration on another effect ends instantly.

### 8. TEMPORARY HIT POINTS

Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you don't add them together, unless a game feature says you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep.

### 9. ROUND DOWN

Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.

### 10. HAVE FUN

You don't need to know every rule to enjoy D&D, and each group has its own style-different ways it likes to tell stories and to use the rules. Embrace what your group enjoys most. In short, follow your bliss!

THE WIZARD TASHA STUDIES MAGIC OUTSIDE THE HUT OF HER ADOPTIVE MOTHER, BABA YAGA.

### CHAPTER 1 CHARACTER OPTIONS

HEN YOU MAKE YOUR D&D CHARACTER, you have an array of options in the Player's Handbook to create the sort of adventurer you want. This chapter adds to those options, making it possible to realize even more character concepts. If you combine these options with those in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, the possibilities for your characters become vast. Here are the options featured in this chapter:

- · A way to customize your character's origin by changing some of your racial traits
- · Guidance on changing your subclass
- · The artificer class, a master of magical invention
- · Class features and subclasses for every class in the Player's Handbook
- · Feats for anyone who uses that optional rule

### CUSTOMIZING YOUR ORIGIN

At 1st level, you choose various aspects of your character, including ability scores, race, class, and background. Together these elements help paint a picture of your character's origin and give you the ability to create many different types of characters. Despite that versatility, a typical character race in D&D includes little or no choice-a lack that can make it difficult to realize certain character concepts. The following subsections address that lack by adding choice to your character's race, allowing you to customize your ability scores, languages, and certain proficiencies to fit the origin you have in mind for your character. Character race in the game represents your character's fantasy species, combined with certain cultural assumptions. The following options step outside those assumptions to pave the way for truly unique characters.

### ABILITY SCORE INCREASES

Whatever D&D race you choose for your character, you get a trait called Ability Score Increase. This increase reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in the adventurers of this kind in D&D's past. For example, if you're a dwarf, your Constitution increases by 2, because dwarf heroes in D&D are often exceptionally tough. This increase doesn't apply to every dwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists to reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it's unhelpful if your character doesn't conform to the archetype.

If you'd like your character to follow their own path, you may ignore your Ability Score Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. Here's how to do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your race or subrace and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can't apply those increases to the same ability score, and you can't increase a score above 20.

For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of your race or subrace increases your Constitution by 2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase vour Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1.

### LANGUAGES

Your character's race includes languages that your character is assumed to know, usually Common and the language of your ancestors. For example, a halfling adventurer is assumed to know Common and Halfling. Here's the thing: D&D adventurers are extraordinary, and your character might have grown up speaking languages different from the ones in your Languages trait.

To customize the languages you know, you may replace each language in your Languages trait with a language from the following list: Abyssal, Celestial. Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, Orc, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.

Your DM may add or remove languages from that list, depending on what languages are appropriate for your campaign.

### PROFICIENCIES

Some races and subraces grant proficiencies. These proficiencies are usually cultural, and your character might not have any connection with the culture in question or might have pursued different training. You can replace each of those proficiencies with a different one of your choice, following the restrictions on the Proficiency Swaps table.

### PROFICIENCY SWAPS

| Proficiency | Replacement Proficiency |
| --- | --- |
| Skill | Skill |
| Armor | Simple/martial weapon or tool |
| Simple weapon | Simple weapon or tool |
| Martial weapon | Simple/martial weapon or tool |
| Tool | Tool or simple weapon |

### CUSTOM LINEAGE

Instead of choosing one of the game's races for your character at 1st level, you can use the following traits to represent your character's lineage, giving you full control over how your character's origin shaped them:

- Creature Type. You are a humanoid. You determine your appearance and whether you resemble any of vour kin.
Size. You are Small or Medium (your choice).

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- Ability Score Increase. One ability score of your choice increases by 2.
- Feat. You gain one feat of your choice for which you qualify.
- Variable Trait. You gain one of the following options of your choice: (a) darkvision with a range of 60 feet or (b) proficiency in one skill of your choice.
- Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character.

For example, high elf adventurers have proficiency with longswords, which are martial weapons. Consulting the Proficiency Swaps table, we see that your high elf can swap that proficiency for proficiency with another weapon or a tool. Your elf might be a musician, who chooses proficiency with a musical instrument-a type of tool-instead of with longswords. Similarly, elves start with proficiency in the Perception skill. Your elf might not have the keen senses associated with your kin and could take proficiency in a different skill, such as Performance.

The "Equipment" chapter of the Player's Handbook includes weapons and tools suitable for these swaps, and your DM might allow additional options.

### PERSONALITY

The description of a race might suggest various things about the behavior and personality of that people's archetypal adventurers. You may ignore those suggestions, whether they're about alignment, moods, interests, or any other personality trait. Your character's personality and behavior are entirely yours to determine.

### CHANGING A SKILL

Sometimes you pick a skill proficiency that ends up not being very useful in the campaign or that no longer fits your character's story. In those cases, talk to your DM about replacing that skill proficiency with another skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level. A convenient time for such a change is when you reach a level that grants you the Ability Score Increase feature, representing that your character has spent a level or two studying the new skill and letting the old one atrophy.

### CHANGING YOUR SUBCLASS

Each character class involves the choice of a subclass at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. A subclass represents an area of specialization and offers different class features as you level up. With your DM's approval, you can change your subclass when you would normally gain a new subclass feature. If you decide to make this change, choose another subclass that belongs to your class and replace all your old subclass features with the features of the new subclass that are for your new level and lower.

### TRAINING TIME

To change your subclass, vour DM might require you to spend time devoted to the transition, as you study the ways of the new specialization. This transition requires a number of days equal to twice your new level in the class; a higher level represents more to learn.

The DM might also require an expenditure of money to pay for training, magical reagents, or other goods needed for the transition. The cost is typically 100 gp times your new level. This cost might be accompanied by a quest of some sort. For example, a sorcerer who wants to adopt a Draconic Bloodline could be required to receive blood, a blessing, or both from an ancient dragon.

If you return to a subclass that you previously held, you forgo the gold cost, and the time required for the transition is halved.

### SUDDEN CHANGE

Sometimes a character undergoes a dramatic transformation in their beliefs and abilities. When a character experiences a profound self-realization or faces an entity or a place of overwhelming power, beauty, or terror, the DM might allow an immediate subclass change. Here are a few examples:

- · An Oath of Devotion paladin failed to stop a demonic horde from ravaging her homeland. After spending a night in sorrowful prayer, she rises the next morning with the features of the Oath of Vengeance, ready to hunt down the horde.
- A wizard lies down for a nap beneath an oak tree whose roots reach into the Feywild. In his dreams, he faces visions of multiple possible futures. When · he awakens, his subclass features have been replaced by those of the School of Divination.
- A cleric of the War Domain has spent years in conflict with the enemies of her temple. But one day, she wanders into a sun-dappled glade, where her god once shed a tear of mercy over the world's suffering. Drinking from the glade's brook, the cleric is filled with such compassion for all people that she now bears the powers of the Life Domain, ready to heal rather than make war.

### ARTIFICER

Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in obiects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.

Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a iob as well as an artificer.

### ARTIFICERS IN MANY WORLDS

Throughout the D&D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many lives have been brightened or saved because of the work of kind artificers, but countless lives have also been lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by certain artificers' creations.

In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational.

Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries from throughout the multiverse, and from there, the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning business that hires adventurers to fix problems that others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron, magic is harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society, largely as a result of the wondrous ingenuity of artificers.

### CREATING AN ARTIFICER

Artificers invent cutting-edge problems, then try to solve them-loudly and often with collateral damage.

To create an artificer, consult the following subsections, which give you hit points, proficiencies, and starting equipment. Then look at the Artificer table to see which features you get at each level. The descriptions of those features appear in the "Artificer Features" section.

### OUICK BUILD

You can make an artificer quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Intelligence, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the guild artisan background.

### HIT POINTS

Hit Dice: 1d8 per artificer level

Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier

Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1st

### PROFICIENCIES

Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons

Tools: Thieves' tools, tinker's tools, one type of artisan's tools of your choice

Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence

Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand

The secrets of gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms in the Dungeon Master's Guide and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.

### STARTING EQUIPMENT

- · any two simple weapons of your choice
- · a light crossbow and 20 bolts
- · your choice of studded leather armor or scale mail
- · thieves' tools and a dungeoneer's pack

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment.

### MULTICLASSING AND THE ARTIFICER

If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose artificer as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum. As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an artificer.

Proficiencies Gained. If artificer isn't your initial, class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an artificer: light armor, medium armor, shields, thieves' tools, tinker's tools.

Spell Slots. Add half your levels (rounded up) in the artificer class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.

### CLASS FEATURES

As an artificer, you gain the following class features, which are summarized in the Artificer table.

### MAGICAL TINKERING

### 1st-level artificer feature

You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

- · The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
- · Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
- · The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
- · A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

### SPELLCASTING

### 1st-level artificer feature

You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.

### TOOLS REQUIRED

You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an "M" component

### THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE

As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool. For example, if you cast cure wounds using alchemist's supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker's tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. The effect of the spell is the same either way.

Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.

when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.

After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.

### CANTRIPS (0-LEVEL SPELLS)

You know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

### PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS

The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

> Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### RITUAL CASTING

You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### ARTIFICER SPELL LIST

Here's the list of spells you consult when you learn an artificer spell. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual. the ritual tag appears after the spell's name.

Each spell is in the Player's Handbook, unless it has one asterisk (a spell in chapter 3) or two asterisks (a spell in Xanathar's Guide to Everything).

### INFUSE ITEM

#### 2nd-level artificer feature

You've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.

### INFUSIONS KNOWN

When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the "Artificer Infusions" section at the end of the class's description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

### INFUSING AN ITEM

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide).

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace vour knowledge of the infusion.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

### ARTIFICER SPECIALIST

### 3rd-level artificer feature

Choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist, Armorer, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which is detailed after the class's description. Your choice grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 15th level.

### THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB

### 3rd-level artificer feature

You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

### ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

### 4th-level artificer feature

When you reach 4th level and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### TOOL EXPERTISE

### 6th-level artificer feature

Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

### FLASH OF GENIUS

### 7th-level artificer feature

You've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### MAGIC ITEM ADEPT

### 10th-level artificer feature

You've achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

- · You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
- · If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.

### SPELL-STORING ITEM

### 11th-level artificer feature

You can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).

> DWARF ALCHEMIST WIT HOMUNCULUS SERVANT

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

### MAGIC ITEM SAVANT

14th-level artificer feature

Your skill with magic items deepens:

- · You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
- · You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.

### MAGIC ITEM MASTER

### 18th-level artificer feature

You can now attune to up to six magic items at once.

### SOUL OF ARTIFICE

### 20th-level artificer feature

You have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

- · You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
- . If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.

### ARTIFICER SPECIALISTS

Artificers pursue many disciplines. Here are specialist options you can choose from at 3rd level.

### ALCHEMIST

The magic of both alchemists and witches relies on a powerful multiversal truth: mortals can't resist any,thing with bubbles .

TASHA

An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents to produce mystical effects. Alchemists use their creations to give life and to leech it away. Alchemy is the oldest of artificer traditions, and its versatility has long been valued during times of war and peace.

### TOOL PROFICIENCY

### 3rd-level Alchemist feature

You gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

### ALCHEMIST SPELLS

3rd-level Alchemist feature

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| 3rd | healing word, ray of sickness |
| 5th | flaming sphere, Melf's acid arrow |

### EXPERIMENTAL ELIXIR

3rd-level Alchemist feature

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an experimental elixir in an empty flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.

You can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table.

Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask.

### EXPERIMENTAL ELIXIR

#### Effect de

### ALCHEMICAL SAVANT

### 5th-level Alchemist feature

You've developed masterful command of magical chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you cast a spell using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

### RESTORATIVE REAGENTS

### 9th-level Alchemist feature

You can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works:

- · Whenever a creature drinks an experimental elixir you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
- · You can cast lesser restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### CHEMICAL MASTERY

### 15th-level Alchemist feature

You have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:

- · You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.
- · You can cast greater restoration and heal without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without material components, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.

### ARMORER

(lassic artificer logic right here: "What if, when our invention goes explosively wrong, we're inside it?" TASHA

An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies armor to function almost like a second skin. The armor is enhanced to hone the artificer's magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.

### TOOLS OF THE TRADE

### 3rd-level Armorer feature

You gain proficiency with heavy armor. You also gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

### ARMORER SPELLS

### 3rd-level Armorer feature

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Armorer Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

### ARMORER SPELLS

| Artificer Level | Spell |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | magic missile, thunderwave |
| 5th | mirror image, shatter |
| 9th | hypnotic pattern, lightning bolt |
| 13th | fire shield, greater invisibility |
| 17th | passwall, wall of force |

### ARCANE ARMOR

### 3rd-level Armorer feature

Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools in hand.

You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:

- · If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.
- · You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.
- · The armor attaches to you and can't be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any

ARMORERS, A DROW INFILTRATOR AND A TIEFLING GUARDIAN

> missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb it replaces.

- · You can doff or don the armor as an action.
The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.

### ARMOR MODEL

### 3rd-level Armorer feature

You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.

Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls.

You can change the armor's model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's tools in hand.

Guardian. You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:

Thunder Gauntlets. Each of the armor's gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren't holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.

Defensive Field. As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Infiltrator. You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:

- Lightning Launcher. A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.
- Powered Steps. Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
- Dampening Field. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.

### EXTRA ATTACK

### 5th-level Armorer feature

You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### ARMOR MODIFICATIONS

### 9th-level Armorer feature

You learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Items feature: armor (the chest piece), boots, helmet, and the armor's special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions, and the infusions transfer over if you change your armor's model with the Armor Model feature. In addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armor.

### PERFECTED ARMOR

### 15th-level Armorer feature

Your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.

Guardian. When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force the creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, pulling the creature up to 30 feet toward vou to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

Infiltrator. Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

### ARTILLERIST

Some artificers ask the hard questions: "Couldn't there be even more collateral damage?"

An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield. This destructive power is valued by armies in the wars on many different worlds. And when war passes, some members of this specialization seek to build a more peaceful world by using their powers to fight the resurgence of strife. The world-hopping gnome artificer Vi has been especially vocal about making things right: "It's about time we fixed things instead of blowing them all to hell."

### TOOL PROFICIENCY

3rd-level Artillerist feature

You gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

### ARTILLERIST SPELLS

3rd-level Artillerist feature

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Artillerist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

### ARTILLERIST SPELLS

| Artificer Level | Spell |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | shield, thunderwave |
| 5th | scorching ray, shatter |
| 9th | fireball, wind wall |
| 13th | ice storm, wall of fire |
| 17th | cone of cold, wall of force |

### ELDRITCH CANNON

3rd-level Artillerist feature

You've learned how to create a magical cannon. Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand.

Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present.

The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.

When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.

### ARCANE FIREARM 5th-level Artillerist feature

You know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarver's tools to carve special sigils into a wand, staff, or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise last indefinitely.

You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled.

### EXPLOSIVE CANNON

9th-level Artillerist feature

Every eldritch cannon you create is now more destructive:

- · The cannon's damage rolls all increase by 1d8.
- · As an action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

### FORTIFIED POSITION

HUMAN ARTILLERIST

WITH ELDRITCH CANNON

15th-level Artillerist feature

You're a master at forming well-defended emplacements using your Eldritch Cannon:

- · You and your allies have half cover while within 10 feet of a cannon you create with Eldritch Cannon, as a result of a shimmering field of magical protection that the cannon emits.
- · You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same action (but not the same spell slot), and you can activate both of them with the same bonus action. You determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can't create a third cannon while you have two.

### BATTLE SMITH

Armies require protection, and someone has to put things back together if defenses fail. A combination of protector and medic, a Battle Smith is an expert at defending others and repairing both materiel and personnel. To aid in their work, Battle Smiths are accompanied by a steel defender, a protective companion of their own creation. Many soldiers tell stories of nearly dying before being saved by a Battle Smith and a steel defender.

In the world of Eberron. Battle Smiths played a kev role in House Cannith's work on battle constructs and the original warforged, and after the Last War, these artificers led efforts to aid those who were in jured in the war's horrific battles.

### TOOL PROFICIENCY

### 3rd-level Battle Smith feature

You gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

### BATTLE SMITH SPELLS

### 3rd-level Battle Smith feature

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Battle Smith Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

### BATTLE SMITH SPELLS

| Artificer Level | Spell |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | heroism, shield |
| 5th | branding smite, warding bond |
| 9th | aura of vitality, conjure barrage |
| 13th | aura of purity, fire shield |
| 17th | banishing smite, mass cure wounds |

### BATTLE READY

### 3rd-level Battle Smith feature

Your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways:

- · You gain proficiency with martial weapons.
- · When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.

### STEEL DEFENDER

### 3rd-level Battle Smith feature

Your tinkering has borne you a companion, a steel defender. It's friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Steel Defender stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

In combat, the defender shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If the mending spell is cast on the defender, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel defender if you have smith's tools with you. If you already have a defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The defender also perishes if you die.

You can learn this infusion multiple times; each time you do so, choose a magic item that you can make with it, picking from the Replicable Items tables. A table's title tells you the level you must be in the class to choose an item from the table. Alternatively, you can choose the magic item from among the common magic items in the game, not including potions or scrolls.

### PATH OF THE BEAST

You have to respect anyone who lets their inner beast out for a brisk jog and healthy throat-ripping .

TASHA

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian.

Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal spirit or be descended from shape-shifters. You can choose the origin of your feral might or determine it by rolling on the Origin of the Beast table.

### ORIGIN OF THE BEAST

- ] One of your parents is a lycanthrope, and you've inherited some of their curse.
- You are descended from an archdruid and inher-2 ited the ability to partially change shape.

You choose the weapon's form each time you rage:

- Bite. Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, you regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus, provided you have less than half your hit points when you hit.

the Attack action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.

- Tail. You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of vou hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, potentially causing the attack to miss you.

- · You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.
- · You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature that accepts this feature. Until the rage ends, the chosen creatures can each use the following benefit once on each of their turns: when the creature hits a target with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the creature can roll a d6 and gain a bonus to the damage equal to the number rolled.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### PATH OF WILD MAGIC

I don't recommend letting magic take the reins, but I'm not your mom. Live deliciously.

TASHA

Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic. These magic-suffused barbarians walk the Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.

### MAGIC AWARENESS

### BARD COLLEGES

At 3rd level, a bard gains the Bard College feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass. The following options are available to you when making that choice: College of Creation and College of Eloquence.

### COLLEGE OF CREATION

one bard's sona of creation is the score to anoth person's nightmares.

TASHA

Bards believe the cosmos is a work of art-the creation of the first dragons and gods. That creative work included harmonies that continue to resound through existence today, a power known as the Song of Creation. The bards of the College of Creation draw on that primeval song through dance, music, and poetry, and their teachers share this lesson: "Before the sun and the moon, there was the Song, and its music awoke the first dawn. Its melodies so delighted the stones and trees that some of them gained a voice of their own. And now they sing too. Learn the Song, students, and you too can teach the mountains to sing and dance."

Dwarves and gnomes often encourage their bards to become students of the Song of Creation. And among dragonborn, the Song of Creation is revered, for legends portray Bahamut and Tiamat-the greatest of dragons-as two of the song's first singers.

### MOTE OF POTENTIAL 3rd-level College of Creation feature

Whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you can utter a note from the Song of Creation to create a Tiny mote of potential, which orbits within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is intangible and invulnerable, and it lasts until the Bardic

Inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical note, a star, a flower, or another symbol of art or life that you choose.

When the creature uses the Bardic Inspiration die, the mote provides an additional effect based on whether the die benefits an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, as detailed below:

Ability Check. When the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die again and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops and emits colorful, harmless sparks for a moment.

- Attack Roll. Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an attack roll against a target, the mote thunderously shatters. The target and each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take thunder damage equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die.
- Saving Throw. Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die and adds it to a saving throw, the mote vanishes with the sound of soft music, causing the creature to gain temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).

### PERFORMANCE OF CREATION

3rd-level College of Creation feature

As an action, you can channel the magic of the Song of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your choice in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The item must appear on a surface or in a liquid that can support it. The gp value of the item can't be more than 20 times vour bard level, and the item must be Medium or smaller. The item glimmers softly, and a creature can faintly hear music when touching it. The created item disappears after a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. For examples of items you can create, see the equipment chapter of the Player's Handbook.

Once you create an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item created by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have an item from this feature, the first one immediately vanishes.

The size of the item you can create with this feature increases by one size category when you reach 6th level (Large) and 14th level (Huge).

Irrepressible Dance. When any creature starts its turn within 10 feet of the item, the item can increase or decrease (your choice) the walking speed of that creature by 10 feet until the end of the turn, provided the item isn't incapacitated.

### ACTIONS

Force-Empowered Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target you can see. Hit: 1d10 + PB force damage.

### ANIMATING PERFORMANCE

6th-level College of Creation feature

As an action, you can target a Large or smaller nonmagical item you can see within 30 feet of you and animate it. The animate item uses the Dancing Item stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB). The item is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die.

In combat, the item shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the item can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can command the item as part of the same bonus action you use for Bardic Inspiration.

Once you animate an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item animated by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have a dancing item from this feature, the first one immediately becomes inanimate.

You are no longer limited by gp value when creating items with Performance of Creation.

You can spin words laced with magic that unsettle a creature and cause it to doubt itself.

The creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.

### UNFAILING INSPIRATION

### 6th-level College of Eloquence feature

### 6th-level College of Eloquence feature

You gain the ability to make your speech intelligible to any creature. As an action, choose one or more creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature).

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to use it again.

### INFECTIOUS INSPIRATION

### 14th-level College of Eloquence feature

When you successfully inspire someone, the power of your eloquence can now spread to someone else. When a creature within 60 feet of you adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll succeeds, you can use your reaction to encourage a different creature (other than yourself) that can hear you within 60 feet of you, giving it a Bardic Inspiration die without expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### CLERIC

The cleric class receives new features and subclasses in this section.

### OPTIONAL CLASS FEATURES

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a cleric. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

If you take a feature that replaces another feature, you gain no benefit from the replaced one and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it.

### ADDITIONAL CLERIC SPELLS

### 1st-level cleric feature

The spells in the following list expand the cleric spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell's name. Each spell is in the Player's Handbook, unless it has an asterisk (a spell in chapter 3). Xanathar's Guide to Everything also offers more spells.

### DIVINE DOMAINS

At 1st level, a cleric gains the Divine Domain feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass. The following options are available to you when making that choice: Order Domain, Peace Domain, and Twilight Domain.

### ORDER DOMAIN

IKKI DAWE

nally, a whole faith about coloring inside the lines . TASHA

The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to the laws that govern a society, an institution, or a philosophy. Clerics of Order meditate on logic and justice as they serve their gods, examples of which appear in the Order Deities table.

Clerics of Order believe that well-crafted laws establish legitimate hierarchies, and those selected by law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability, and if those who lead fail to protect the law, they must be replaced. In this manner, law weaves a web of obligations that create order and security in a chaotic multiverse.

### ORDER DEITIES

| Example Deity | Pantheon |
| --- | --- |
| Aureon | Eberron |
| Bane | Forgotten Realms |
| Majere | Dragonlance |
| Pholtus | Greyhawk |

If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.

### CHANNEL DIVINITY: ORDER'S DEMAND 2nd-level Order Domain feature

You can use your Channel Divinity to exert an intimidating presence over others.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn or until the charmed creature takes any damage. You can also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.

### EMBODIMENT OF THE LAW

6th-level Order Domain feature

You have become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others.

If you cast a spell of the enchantment school using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can change the spell's casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting, provided the spell's casting time is normally 1 action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### DIVINE STRIKE

### 8th-level Order Domain feature

You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### ORDER'S WRATH

### 17th-level Order Domain feature

Enemies you designate for destruction wilt under the combined efforts of you and your allies. If you deal your Divine Strike damage to a creature on your turn, you can curse that creature until the start of your next turn. The next time one of your allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the target also takes 2d8 psychic damage, and the curse ends. You can curse a creature in this way only once per turn.

### PEACE DOMAIN

Have these peaceful clerics even considered that they're subverting a most holy system, one where bad decisions coincide with the teaching power of pain?

TASHA

The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing. See the Peace Deities table for a list of some of the gods associated with this domain.

Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics' blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another's burdens, and the clerics' magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.

### PEACE DEITIES

You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### CHANNEL DIVINITY: BALM OF PEACE 2nd-level Peace Domain feature

You can use your Channel Divinity to make your very presence a soothing balm. As an action, you can move up to your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks, and when you move within 5 feet

of any other creature during this action, you can restore a number of hit points to that creature equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). A creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action.

### PROTECTIVE BOND 6th-level Peace Domain feature

The bond you forge between people helps them protect each other. When a creature affected by your Emboldening Bond feature is about to take damage, a second bonded creature within 30 feet of the first can use its reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the first creature. The second creature then takes all the damage instead.

### POTENT SPELLCASTING

8th-level Peace Domain feature

You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### EXPANSIVE BOND

17th-level Peace Domain feature

The benefits of your Emboldening Bond and Protective Bond features now work when the creatures are within 60 feet of each other. Moreover, when a creature uses Protective Bond to take someone else's damage, the creature has resistance to that damage.

### TWILIGHT DOMAIN

I can't believe I'm writing this, but I think I could get behind a faith focused on mood lighting and evening wear .

TASHA

The twilit transition from light into darkness often brings calm and even joy, as the day's labors end and the hours of rest begin. The darkness can also bring terrors, but the gods of twilight guard against the horrors of the night.

Clerics who serve these deities-examples of which appear on the Twilight Deities table-bring comfort to those who seek rest and protect them by venturing into the encroaching darkness to ensure that the dark is a comfort, not a terror.

### TWILIGHT DEITIES

As an action, you can magically share the darkvision of this feature with willing creatures you can see within 10 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature).

The sphere moves with you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the sphere, you can grant that creature one of these benefits:

### OPTIONAL CLASS FEATURES

### CANTRIP VERSATILITY

### 4th-level druid feature

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the druid spell list.

### DRUID CIRCLES

At 2nd level, a druid gains the Druid Circle feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass. The following options are available to you when making that choice: Circle of Spores, Circle of Stars, and Circle of Wildfire.

### CIRCLE OF SPORES

I'm an avid collector of spores, molds, and fungi-my most prized find being a sapiens zugatmata from the depths of Mount Zogon. I wouldn't want it steering a corpse around and touching my stuff, though.

TASHA

Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.

Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. They see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.

### CIRCLE SPELLS

### 2nd-level Circle of Spores feature

Your symbiotic link to fungi and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the chill touch cantrip.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### CIRCLE OF SPORES SPELLS

| Druid Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 2nd | chill touch |
| 3rd | blindness/deafness, gentle repose |
| 5th | animate dead, gaseous form |
| 7th | blight, confusion |
| 9th | cloudkill, contagion |

### HALO OF SPORES

### 2nd-level Circle of Spores feature

You are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

A GNOME DRUID OF SPORES PICKS MUSHROOMS WITH HIS BULLYWUG ZOMBIE COMPANION

### SYMBIOTIC ENTITY

### 2nd-level Circle of Spores feature

You gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

- · When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
- · Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

### FUNGAL INFESTATION

### 6th-level Circle of Spores feature

Your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the Zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### SPREADING SPORES

#### 10th-level Circle of Spores feature

You gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 30 feet away, where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no longer active.

Whenever a creature moves into the cube or starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn.

While the cube of spores persists, you can't use your Halo of Spores reaction.

### FUNGAL BODY 14th-level Circle of Spores feature

The fungal spores in your body alter you: you can't be blinded, deafened, frightened, or poisoned, and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead, unless you're incapacitated.

### CIRCLE OF STARS

What about the dark places between the stars? Don't you realize that's where the good stuff is?

TASHA

The Circle of Stars allows druids to draw on the power of starlight. These druids have tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By revealing and understanding these secrets, the Circle of the Stars seeks to harness the powers of the cosmos.

Many druids of this circle keep records of the constellations and the stars' effects on the world. Some groups document these observations at megalithic sites, which serve as enigmatic libraries of lore. These repositories might take the form of stone circles, pyramids, petroglyphs, and underground temples-any construction durable enough to protect the circle's sacred knowledge even against a great cataclysm.

### STAR MAP

### 2nd-level Circle of the Stars feature

You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.

While holding this map, you have these benefits:

- · You know the guidance cantrip.
- · You have the guiding bolt spell prepared. It counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can have prepared.
- · You can cast guiding bolt without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous map.

### STAR MAP

#### Map Form de

- A scroll covered with depictions of constellations 1
- A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it 2
- A speckled owlbear hide, tooled with raised marks 3
- A collection of maps bound in an ebony cover 4
- 5 A crystal that projects starry patterns when placed before a light
- 6 Glass disks that depict constellations

### STARRY FORM

### 2nd-level Circle of the Stars feature

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form:

- Archer. A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a lumi-
nous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

- Chalice. A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.
- Dragon. A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

### COSMIC OMEN

### 6th-level Circle of the Stars feature

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a die. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain access to a special reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

- Weal (even). Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.
- Woe (odd). Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### TWINKLING CONSTELLATIONS

10th-level Circle of the Stars feature

The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a flying speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.

### FULL OF STARS

14th-level Circle of the Stars feature

While in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

### CIRCLE OF WILDFIRE

I can't tell you how many times I've burned everything to the ground and started over .

TASHA

Druids within the Circle of Wildfire understand that destruction is sometimes the precursor of creation. such as when a forest fire promotes later growth. These druids bond with a primal spirit that harbors both destructive and creative power, allowing the druids to create controlled flames that burn away one thing but give life to another.

### CIRCLE SPELLS

2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature

You have formed a bond with a wildfire spirit, a primal being of creation and destruction. Your link with this spirit grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Wildfire Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### SUMMON WILDFIRE SPIRIT

2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature

You can summon the primal spirit bound to your soul. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit, rather than assuming a beast form.

The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6 fire damage.

The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Wildfire Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the spirit's appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire.

Fiery Teleportation. The spirit and each willing creature of your choice within 5 feet of it teleport up to 15 feet to unoccupied spaces you can see. Then each creature within 5 feet of the space that the spirit left must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d6 + PB fire damage.

In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.

### ENHANCED BOND

### 6th-level Circle of Wildfire feature

The bond with your wildfire spirit enhances your destructive and restorative spells. Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage or restores hit points while your wildfire spirit is summoned, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus equal to the number rolled to one damage or healing roll of the spell.

In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your wildfire spirit.

### CAUTERIZING FLAMES

10th-level Circle of Wildfire feature

You gain the ability to turn death into magical flames that can heal or incinerate. When a Small or larger creature dies within 30 feet of you or your wildfire spirit, a harmless spectral flame springs forth in the dead creature's space and flickers there for 1 minute. When a creature you can see enters that space, you can use your reaction to extinguish the spectral flame there and either heal the creature or deal fire damage to it. The healing or damage equals 2d10 + your Wisdom modifier.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### BLAZING REVIVAL

14th-level Circle of Wildfire feature

The bond with your wildfire spirit can save you from death. If the spirit is within 120 feet of you when you are reduced to 0 hit points and thereby fall unconscious, you can cause the spirit to drop to 0 hit points. You then regain half your hit points and immediately rise to your feet.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest.

The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice.

Once on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of you with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one Psionic Energy die, rolling it and dealing force damage to the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.

If you can see the target and it is within 30 feet of you, you can move it up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if it is a Tiny object, you can move it to or from your hand. Either way, you can move the target horizontally, vertically, or both.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### WAY OF THE ASTRAL SELF

Note to self: create a spell that lets you throat-punc people with your ahost.

TASHA

A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self believes their body is an illusion. They see their ki as a representation of their true form, an astral self. This astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or disorder, with some monasteries training students to use their power to protect the weak and other instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true selves in service to the mighty.

### ARMS OF THE ASTRAL SELF

3rd-level Way of the Astral Self feature

Your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to summon the arms of your astral self. When you do so, each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.

For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). You determine the arms' appearance, and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die.

While the spectral arms are present, you gain the following benefits:

- · You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- · You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed strikes.
- · When you make an unarmed strike with the arms on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.
- · The unarmed strikes you make with the arms can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls, and their damage type is force.

### VISAGE OF THE ASTRAL SELF 6th-level Way of the Astral Self feature

You can summon the visage of your astral self. As a bonus action, or as part of the bonus action you take to activate Arms of the Astral Self, you can spend 1 ki point to summon this visage for 10 minutes. It vanishes early if you are incapacitated or die.

The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet or mask. You determine its appearance.

While the spectral visage is present, you gain the following benefits.

Astral Sight. You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

Wisdom of the Spirit. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

Word of the Spirit. When you speak, you can direct your words to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you, making it so only that creature can hear you. Alternatively, you can amplify your voice so that all creatures within 600 feet can hear you.

### BODY OF THE ASTRAL SELF 1 1th-level Way of the Astral Self feature

When you have both your astral arms and visage summoned, you can cause the body of your astral self to appear (no action required). This spectral body covers your physical form like a suit of armor, connecting with the arms and visage. You determine its appearance.

While the spectral body is present, you gain the following benefits.

Deflect Energy. When you take acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to deflect it. When you do so, the damage you take is reduced by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum reduction of 1).

Your connection to your astral self is complete, allowing you to unleash its full potential. As a bonus action, you can spend 5 ki points to summon the arms, visage, and body of your astral self and awaken it for 10 minutes. This awakening ends early if you are incapacitated or die.

While your astral self is awakened, you gain the following benefits.

> DRAGONBORN MONK OF THE ASTRAL SELF

### FORMS OF YOUR ASTRAL SELF

The astral self is a translucent embodiment of the monk's soul. As a result, an astral self can reflect aspects of a monk's background, ideals, flaws, and bonds, and an astral self doesn't necessarily look anything like the monk. For example, the astral self of a lanky human might be reminiscent of a minotaur-the strength of which the monk feels within. Similarly, an orc monk might manifest gossamer arms and a delicate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the orc's soul. Each astral self is unique, and some of the monks of this monastic tradition are known more for the appearance of their astral self than for their physical appearance.

When choosing this path, consider the quirks that define your monk. Are you obsessed with something? Are you driven by justice or a selfish desire? Any of these motivations could manifest in the form of your astral self.

### Armor of the Spirit. You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class.

Astral Barrage. Whenever you use the Extra Attack feature to attack twice, you can instead attack three times if all the attacks are made with your astral arms.

### OATH OF THE WATCHERS

These paladins aren't at all up to what I expected: Worse , they send home your party's best quests.

TASHA

The Oath of the Watchers binds paladins to protect mortal realms from the predations of extraplanar creatures, many of which can lay waste to mortal soldiers. Thus, the Watchers hone their minds, spirits, and bodies to be the ultimate weapons against such threats.

Paladins who follow the Watchers' oath are ever vigilant in spotting the influence of extraplanar forces, often establishing a network of spies and informants to gather information on suspected cults. To a Watcher, keeping a healthy suspicion and awareness about one's surroundings is as natural as wearing armor in battle.

### TENETS OF THE WATCHERS

A paladin who assumes the Oath of the Watchers swears to safeguard mortal realms from otherworldly threats.

Vigilance. The threats you face are cunning, powerful, and subversive. Be ever alert for their corruption.

Loyalty. Never accept gifts or favors from fiends or those who truck with them. Stay true to your order, your comrades, and your duty.

### SWARMKEEPER

I love insects-organized, relentless, specialized little champions. And aligning their single-minded will with your own: beautiful. Just keep them out of my lab . TASHA

SWARMKEEPER

Feeling a deep connection to the environment around them, some rangers reach out through their magical connection to the world and bond with a swarm of nature spirits. The swarm becomes a potent force in battle, as well as helpful company for the ranger. Some Swarmkeepers are outcasts or hermits, keeping to themselves and their attendant swarms rather than dealing with the discomfort of others. Other Swarmkeepers enjoy building vibrant communities that work for the mutual benefit of all those they consider part of their swarm.

### GATHERED SWARM

### 3rd-level Swarmkeeper feature

A swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded itself to you and can assist you in battle. Until you die, the swarm remains in your space, crawling on you or flying and skittering around you within your space. You determine its appearance, or you generate its appearance by rolling on the Swarm Appearance table.

### SWARM APPEARANCE

- d 4 Appearance
- l Swarming insects
- 2 Miniature twig blights
- 3 Fluttering birds

- · The attack's target takes 1d6 piercing damage from the swarm.
- · The attack's target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be moved by the swarm up to 15 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.

### SWARMKEEPER SPELLS

| Ranger Level | Spell |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | faerie fire, mage hand |
| 5th | web |
| 9th | gaseous form |
| 13th | arcane eye |
| 17th | insect plague |

### IT'S YOUR SWARM

A Swarmkeeper's swarm and spells are reflections of the character's bond with nature spirits. Take the opportunity to describe the swarm and the ranger's magic in play. For example, when your ranger casts gaseous form, they might appear to melt into the swarm, instead of a cloud of mist, or the arcane eye spell could create an extension of your swarm that spies for you. Such descriptions don't change the effects of spells, but they are an exciting opportunity to explore your character's narrative through their class abilities. For more guidance on customizing spells, see the "Personalizing Spells" section in chapter 3.

Also, remember that the swarm's appearance is yours to customize, and don't feel confined to a single appearance. Perhaps the spirits' look changes with the ranger's mood or with the seasons. You decide!

### WRITHING TIDE

#### 7th-level Swarmkeeper feature

You can condense part of your swarm into a focused mass that lifts you up. As a bonus action, you gain a flying speed of 10 feet and can hover. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated.

### SWARMING DISPERSAL

#### 15th-level Swarmkeeper feature

You can discorporate into your swarm, avoiding danger. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to that damage. You vanish into your swarm and then teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, where you reappear with the swarm.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### BEAST MASTER COMPANIONS

The Beast Master in the Player's Handbook forms a mystical bond with an animal. As an alternative, a Beast Master can take the feature below to form a bond with a special primal beast instead.

### PRIMAL COMPANION

### 3rd-level Beast Master feature, which replaces the Ranger's Companion feature

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. The beast is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. Choose its stat block-Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky-which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You also determine the kind of animal the beast is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal markings, indicating its mystical origin.

In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not iust Dodge.

If the beast has died within the last hour, you can use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of

### ROGUE

The rogue class receives new features and subclasses in this section.

### OPTIONAL CLASS FEATURE

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers an additional feature that you can gain as a rogue. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the feature here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain the feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description.

### STEADY AIM

### 3rd-level rogue feature

As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

### ROGUISH ARCHETYPES

At 3rd level, a rogue gains the Roguish Archetype feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass. The following options are available to you when making that choice: the Phantom and the Soulknife.

### PHANTOM

(ollecting the souls of your defeated foes in everyday objects-what a good idea. Though, I'd probably need an encyclopedia to hold all my anti-admirers .

TASHA

Many rogues walk a fine line between life and death, risking their own lives and taking the lives of others. While adventuring on that line, some rogues discover a mystical connection to death itself. These rogues take knowledge from the dead and become immersed in negative energy, eventually becoming like ghosts. Thieves' guilds value them as highly effective information gatherers and spies.

Many shadar-kai of the Shadowfell are masters of these macabre techniques, and some are willing to teach this path. In places like Thay in the Forgotten Realms and Karrnath in Eberron, where many necromancers practice their craft, a Phantom can become a wizard's confidant and right hand. In temples of gods of death, the Phantom might work as an agent to track down those who try to cheat death and to recover knowledge that might otherwise be lost to the grave.

How did you discover this grim power? Did you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new abilities? Or did you cultivate them in a temple or thieves' guild dedicated to a deity of death?

### WHISPERS OF THE DEAD

### 3rd-level Phantom feature

Echoes of those who have died cling to you. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can choose one skill or tool proficiency that you lack and gain it, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with you. You lose this proficiency when you use this feature to choose a different proficiency that you lack.

### WAILS FROM THE GRAVE 3rd-level Phantom feature

As you nudge someone closer to the grave, you can channel the power of death to harm someone else as well. Immediately after you deal your Sneak Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of Sneak Attack dice for your level (round up), and the second creature takes necrotic damage equal to the roll's total, as wails of the dead sound around them for a moment.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### TOKENS OF THE DEPARTED

### 9th-level Phantom feature

When a life ends in your presence, you're able to snatch a token from the departing soul, a sliver of its life essence that takes physical form: as a reaction when a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause a Tiny trinket to appear there, a soul trinket. The DM determines the trinket's form or has you roll on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook to generate it.

You can have a maximum number of soul trinkets equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't create one while at your maximum.

You can use soul trinkets in the following ways:

- · While a soul trinket is on your person, you have advantage on death saving throws and Constitution saving throws, for your vitality is enhanced by the life essence within the object.
- · When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your turn, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets that's on your person and then immediately use Wails from the Grave, without expending a use of that feature.
- As an action, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets, no matter where it's located. When you do so, you can ask the spirit associated with the trinket one question. The spirit appears to you and answers in a language it knew in life. It's under no obligation to be truthful, and it answers as concisely as possible, eager to be free. The spirit knows only what it knew in life, as determined by the DM.

### GHOST WALK

#### 13th-level Phantom feature

You can phase partially into the realm of the dead, becoming like a ghost. As a bonus action, you assume a spectral form. While in this form, you have a flying speed of 10 feet, you can hover, and attack rolls have disadvantage against you. You can also move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.

You stay in this form for 10 minutes or until you end it as a bonus action. To use this feature again, you must finish a long rest or destroy one of your soul trinkets as part of the bonus action you use to activate Ghost Walk.

### DEATH'S FRIEND 17th-level Phantom feature

Your association with death has become so close that you gain the following benefits:

- · When you use your Wails from the Grave, you can deal the necrotic damage to both the first and the second creature.
- · At the end of a long rest, a soul trinket appears in your hand if you don't have any soul trinkets, as the spirits of the dead are drawn to you.

### SOULKNIFE

I also have the ability to manifest my thoughts in ways that cut people. I call this power ... words .

TASHA

63

Most assassins strike with physical weapons, and many burglars and spies use thieves' tools to infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a Soulknife strikes and infiltrates with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. They find easy employment as members of thieves' guilds,

HALFLING SOULKNIFE

though they are often mistrusted by rogues who are leery of anyone using strange mind powers to conduct their business. Most governments would also be happy to employ a Soulknife as a spy.

Amid the trees of ancient forests on the Material Plane and in the Feywild, some wood elves walk the path of the Soulknife, serving as silent, lethal guardians of their woods. In the endless war among the gith, a githzerai is encouraged to become a Soulknife when stealth is required against the githyanki foe.

As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since you were a child, only revealing their full potential as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out a reclusive order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.

### PSIONIC POWER

### 3rd-level Soulknife feature

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have, which are detailed below.

Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice. Psi-Bolstered Knack. When your nonpsionic training fails you, your psionic power can help: if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. You expend the die only if the roll succeeds.

Psychic Whispers. You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others-perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can't use this telepathy if it can't speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don't need to speak a common language to understand each other.

The first time you use this power after each long rest, you don't expend the Psionic Energy die. All other times you use the power, you expend the die.

### PSYCHIC BLADES

### 3rd-level Soulknife feature

You can manifest your psionic power as shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can manifest a psychic blade from your free hand and make the attack with that blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a normal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, it deals psychic damage equal to 1d6 plus the ability modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals damage.

After you attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second psychic blade as a bonus action on the same turn, provided your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4, instead of 1d6.

### SOUL BLADES

### 9th-level Soulknife feature

Your Psychic Blades are now an expression of your psi-suffused soul, giving you these powers that use your Psionic Energy dice:

Homing Strikes. If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, you expend the Psionic Energy die.

Psychic Teleportation. As a bonus action, you manifest one of your Psychic Blades, expend one Psionic Energy die and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.

### PSYCHIC VEIL

#### 13th-level Soulknife feature

You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As an action, you can magically become invisible, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to use this feature again.

### REND MIND

### 17th-level Soulknife feature

You can sweep your Psychic Blades directly through a creature's mind. When you use your Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). If the save fails, the target is stunned for 1 minute. The stunned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend three Psionic Energy dice to use it again.

### SORCERER

The sorcerer class receives new features and subclasses in this section.

### OPTIONAL CLASS FEATURES

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a sorcerer. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically.

These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

- · Replace one of the options you chose for the Metamagic feature with a different Metamagic option available to you.
- · Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the sorcerer spell list.

### MAGICAL GUIDANCE

### 5th-level sorcerer feature

You can tap into your inner wellspring of magic to try to conjure success from failure. When you make an ability check that fails, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll, potentially turning the failure into a success.

### SORCEROUS ORIGINS

At 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass. The following options are available to you when making that choice: the Aberrant Mind and the Clockwork Soul.

### ABERRANT MIND

Tentacles, psychic powers, beings from beyond the stars-one person's bad dream is another person's aood time.

TASHA

An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you by using it to control the magical energy of the multiverse. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a source of terror to those who feel the stab of your mind and witness the strange manifestations of your might?

> A SORCERER USES TRANSMUTED SPELL

As an Aberrant Mind sorcerer, you decide how you acquired your powers. Were you born with them? Or did an event later in life leave you shining with psionic awareness? Consult the Aberrant Origins table for a possible origin of your power.

### ABERRANT ORIGINS

#### de Origin

- ] You were exposed to the Far Realm's warping influence. You are convinced that a tentacle is now growing on you, but no one else can see it.
- A psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried 2 psionic energy to you. When you use your powers, faint motes of light sparkle around you.
- 3 You once suffered the dominating powers of an aboleth, leaving a psychic splinter in your mind.
- You were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but 4 the ceremorphosis never completed. And now its psionic power is yours. When you use it, your flesh shines with a strange mucus.
- 5 As a child, you had an imaginary friend that looked like a flumph or a strange platypus-like creature. One day, it gifted you with psionic powers, which have ended up being not so imaginary.
- 6 Your nightmares whisper the truth to you: your psionic powers are not your own. You draw them from your parasitic twin!

### PSIONIC SPELLS

### 1st-level Aberrant Mind feature

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Psionic Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a divination or an enchantment spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

You and the chosen creature can speak telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must speak mentally in a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your sorcerer level. It ends early if you are incapacitated or die or if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.

### PSIONIC SORCERY

### 6th-level Aberrant Mind feature

When you cast any spell of 1st level or higher from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level.

### REVELATION IN FLESH

You can unleash your aberrant power as a space-warping anomaly. As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 force damage and is pulled

straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.

### CLOCKWORK SOUL

I rarely tell people I speak Modron because, they just want to learn how to curse, so let's get this out of the way now.

Lesson one: "beed boop" and other slams.

IASHA

The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it-a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency. You, or someone from your lineage, might have become entangled in the machinations of the modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it is part of a vast and glorious system.

### CLOCKWORK MAGIC

1st-level Clockwork Soul feature

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Clockwork Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an abjuration or a transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

### CLOCKWORK SPELLS

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | alarm, protection from evil and good |
| 3rd | aid, lesser restoration |
| 5th | dispel magic, protection from energy |
| 7th | freedom of movement, summon construct |
|  | (a spell in chapter 3) |
| 9th | greater restoration, wall of force |

In addition, consult the Manifestations of Order table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any of your sorcerer spells.

### MANIFESTATIONS OF ORDER

- de Manifestation
- Spectral cogwheels hover behind you. l
- The hands of a clock spin in your eyes. 2
- 3 Your skin glows with a brassy sheen.

- 6 The ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be heard by you and those affected by your magic.

### RESTORE BALANCE

### 1st-level Clockwork Soul feature

Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage and disadvantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### BASTION OF LAW

### 6th-level Clockwork Soul feature

You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As an action, you can expend 1 to 5 sorcery points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The ward lasts until you finish a long rest or until you use this feature again.

The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of sorcery points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.

### TRANCE OF ORDER

### 14th-level Clockwork Soul feature

You gain the ability to align your consciousness to the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a bonus action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you can't benefit from advantage, and whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.

### CLOCKWORK CAVALCADE 18th-level Clockwork Soul feature

You summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As an action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot cube originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the following effects within the cube before vanishing:

- · The spirits restore up to 100 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the cube.
- · Any damaged objects entirely in the cube are repaired instantly.
- Every spell of 6th level or lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the cube.

This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.

If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.

- · Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.
- · If you're 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another warlock spell of the same level.

When you choose eldritch invocations, you have access to these additional options.

### BOND OF THE TALISMAN

Prerequisite: 12th-level warlock, Pact of the Talisman feature

While someone else is wearing your talisman, you can use your action to teleport to the unoccupied space closest to them, provided the two of you are on the same plane of existence.

You can cast the sending spell, targeting a creature whose name is on the page, without using a spell slot and without using material components. To do so, you must write the message on the page. The target hears the message in their mind, and if the target replies, their message appears on the page, rather than in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.

As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching it.

### GIFT OF THE PROTECTORS

Prerequisite: 9th-level warlock, Pact of the Tome feature

### PROTECTION OF THE TALISMAN

Prerequisite: 7th-level warlock, Pact of the Talisman feature

AN WADI OCH THE FATHOMLESS

### OTHERWORLDLY PATRONS

At 1st level, a warlock gains the Otherworldly Patron feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass. The following options are available to you when making that choice: the Fathomless and the Genie.

### THE FATHOMLESS

I never understood why some people get so jittery about tentacles. Have you ever had octopus nigiri? one of the ew pieces of evidence of a benevolent multiverse.

TASHA

You have plunged into a pact with the deeps. An entity of the ocean, the Elemental Plane of Water, or another otherworldly sea now allows you to draw on its thalassic power. Is it merely using you to learn about terrestrial realms, or does it want you to open cosmic floodgates and drown the world?

Perhaps you were born into a generational cult that venerates the Fathomless and its spawn. Or vou might have been shipwrecked and on the brink of drowning when your patron's grasp offered you a chance at life. Whatever the reason for your pact, the sea and its unknown depths call to you.

Entities of the deep that might empower a warlock include krakens, ancient water elementals, godlike hallucinations dreamed into being by kuo-toa, merfolk demigods, and sea hag covens.

### EXPANDED SPELL LIST

1st-level Fathomless feature

The Fathomless lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

### FATHOMLESS EXPANDED SPELLS

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| lst | create or destroy water, thunderwave |
| 2nd | gust of wind, silence |
| 3rd | lightning bolt, sleet storm |
| 4th | control water, summon elemental |
|  | (water only; a spell in chapter 3) |
| 5th | Bigby's hand (appears as a tentacle), |
|  | cone of cold |

### TENTACLE OF THE DEEPS

1st-level Fathomless feature

You can magically summon a spectral tentacle that strikes at your foes. As a bonus action, you create a 10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The tentacle lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature to create another tentacle.

When you create the tentacle, you can make a melee spell attack against one creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level in this class, the damage increases to 2d8.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack.

You can summon the tentacle a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### GIFT OF THE SEA

1st-level Fathomless feature

You gain a swimming speed of 40 feet, and you can breathe underwater.

### OCEANIC SOUL

### 6th-level Fathomless feature

You are now even more at home in the depths. You gain resistance to cold damage. In addition, when vou are fully submerged, any creature that is also fully submerged can understand your speech, and you can understand theirs.

### GUARDIAN COIL

### 6th-level Fathomless feature

Your Tentacle of the Deeps can defend you and others, interposing itself between them and harm. When you or a creature you can see takes damage while within 10 feet of the tentacle, you can use your reaction to choose one of those creatures and reduce the damage to that creature by 1d8. When you reach 10th level in this class, the damage reduced by the tentacle increases to 2d8.

### GRASPING TENTACLES

### 10th-level Fathomless feature

You learn the spell Evard's black tentacles. It counts as a warlock spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Whenever you cast this spell, your patron's magic bolsters you, granting you a number of temporary hit points equal to your warlock level. Moreover, damage can't break your concentration on this spell.

### FATHOMLESS PLUNGE

### 14th-level Fathomless feature

You can magically open temporary conduits to watery destinations. As an action, you can teleport yourself and up to five other willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you. Amid a whirl of tentacles, you all vanish and then reappear up to 1 mile away in a body of water you've seen (pond size or larger) or within 30 feet of it, each of you appearing in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the others.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### THE GENIE

I know finding housing in Greyhawk is rough, but when genies or warlocks offer you cheap rent, run.

TASHA

You have made a pact with one of the rarest kinds of genie, a noble genie. Such entities rule vast fiefs on the Elemental Planes and have great influence over lesser genies and elemental creatures. Noble genies are varied in their motivations, but most are arrogant and wield power that rivals that of lesser deities. They delight in turning the table on mortals. who often bind genies into servitude, and readily enter into pacts that expand their reach.

You choose your patron's kind or determine it randomly, using the Genie Kind table.

### GENIE KIND

| d4 | Kind | Element |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Dao | Earth |
| 2 | Djinni | Air |
|  | Efreeti | Fire |
| ব | Marid | Water |

### EXPANDED SPELL LIST

1st-level Genie feature

The Genie lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The Genie Expanded Spells table shows the genie spells that are added to the warlock spell list for you, along with the spells associated in the table with your patron's kind: dao, djinni, efreeti, or marid.

### GENIE'S VESSEL

### 1st-level Genie feature

Your patron gifts you a magical vessel that grants you a measure of the genie's power. The vessel is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. You decide what the object is, or you can determine what it is randomly by rolling on the Genie's Vessel table.

| GENIE EXPANDED SPELLS |
| --- |

| Spell Level | Genie Spells | Dao Spells | Djinni Spells | Efreeti Spells | Marid Spells |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 9th | wish |  |  |  |  |

### GENIE'S VESSEL

| વેe | Vessel |
| --- | --- |
|  | Oil lamp |
| 2 | Urn |
|  | Ring with a compartment |
|  | Stoppered bottle |
|  | Hollow statuette |
| 6 | Ornate lantern |

While you are touching the vessel, you can use it in the following ways:

Bottled Respite. As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can't enter again until you finish a long rest.

- Genie's Wrath. Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus. The type of this damage is determined by your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).
The vessel's AC equals your spell save DC. Its hit points equal your warlock level plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.

### ELEMENTAL GIFT

### 6th-level Genie feature

You begin to take on characteristics of your patron's kind. You now have resistance to a damage type determined by your patron's kind: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).

In addition, as a bonus action, you can give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet that lasts for 10 minutes, during which you can hover. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### SANCTUARY VESSEL

### 10th-level Genie feature

When you enter your Genie's Vessel via the Bottled Respite feature, you can now choose up to five willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you, and the chosen creatures are drawn into the vessel with you.

As a bonus action, you can eiect any number of creatures from the vessel, and everyone is ejected if you leave or die or if the vessel is destroyed.

In addition, anyone (including you) who remains within the vessel for at least 10 minutes gains the benefit of finishing a short rest, and anyone can add your proficiency bonus to the number of hit points they regain if they spend any Hit Dice as part of a short rest there.

### LIMITED WISH

#### 14th-level Genie feature

You entreat your patron to grant you a small wish. As an action, you can speak your desire to your Genie's Vessel, requesting the effect of one spell that is 6th level or lower and has a casting time of 1 action. The spell can be from any class's spell list, and you don't need to meet the requirements in that spell, including costly components; the spell simply takes effect as part of this action.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish 1d4 long rests.

### WIZARD

The wizard class receives new features and subclasses in this section.

### OPTIONAL CLASS FEATURES

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as a wizard. Unlike the features in the Player's Handbook, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

### ADDITIONAL WIZARD SPELLS

### 1st-level wizard feature

The spells in the following list expand the wizard spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. A spell's school of magic is noted, and if a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell's name.

### CANTRIP FORMULAS

### 3rd-level wizard feature

You have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip in your mind. Whenever you finish a long rest and consult those formulas in your spellbook, you can replace one wizard cantrip you know with another cantrip from the wizard spell list.

### ARCANE TRADITIONS

At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass. The following options are available to you when making that choice: Bladesinging and the Order of Scribes.

### BLADESINGING

When faced with the endless onslaught of magical possibilities, many wizards suffer identity crises. Some over.come, some break, and some become sword-bards. TASHA

Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. Originally created by elves, this tradition has been adopted by non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the elven ways.

In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating

attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have observed a bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade.

### TRAINING IN WAR AND SONG

2nd-level Bladesinging feature

You gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain proficiency with one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice.

You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already have it.

### BLADESONG

### 2nd-level Bladesinging feature

You can invoke an elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).

While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:

> A DROW AND A HIGH ELF BLADESINGER

- · You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
- · Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
- · You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
- · You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when vou finish a long rest.

### EXTRA ATTACK

### 6th-level Bladesinging feature

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever vou take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

### SONG OF DEFENSE

### 10th-level Bladesinging feature

You can direct your magic to absorb damage while your Bladesong is active. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one spell slot and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal to five times the spell slot's level.

### SONG OF VICTORY

### 14th-level Bladesinging feature

You can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage of your melee weapon attacks while your Bladesong is active.

### ORDER OF SCRIBES

Magic is great and all, but have you smelled a book? TASHA

Magic of the book-that's what many folk call wizardry. The name is apt, given how much time wizards spend poring over tomes and penning theories about the nature of magic. It's rare to see wizards traveling without books and scrolls sprouting from their bags, and a wizard would go to great lengths to plumb an archive of ancient knowledge.

Among wizards, the Order of Scribes is the most bookish. It takes many forms in different worlds, but its primary mission is the same everywhere: recording magical discoveries so that wizardry can flourish. And while all wizards value spellbooks, a wizard in the Order of Scribes magically awakens their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All wizards study books, but a wizardly scribe talks to theirs!

### WIZARDLY QUILL

2nd-level Order of Scribes feature

As a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the following properties:

- · The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.
- · The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.
- · You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.

This quill disappears if you create another one or if you die.

### AWAKENED SPELLBOOK

2nd-level Order of Scribes feature

Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spellbook.

While you are holding the book, it grants you the following benefits:

- · You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
- · When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.
- · When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit. you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.

### MANIFEST MIND

#### 6th-level Order of Scribes feature

You can conjure forth the mind of your Awakened Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past ( your choice).

While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears (no action required).

Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects.

The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts dispel magic on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action.

Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.

### MASTER SCRIVENER

### 10th-level Order of Scribes feature

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll.

The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.

You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which are described in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill.

### ONE WITH THE WORD

### 14th-level Order of Scribes feature

Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, as the spellbook helps you remember magical lore.

Moreover, if you take damage while your spellbook's mind is manifested, you can prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to dismiss the spectral mind, using its magic to save yourself. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the roll's total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there aren't enough spells in the book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points.

Until you finish 1d6 long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. After you finish the required number of rests, the spells reappear in the spellbook.

· Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

ASTRIDE A UNICORN, A TELEPATHIC INSPIRES HER WIZARD COMPANION

A GROUP OF WIZARDS PLEDGES THEMSELVES TO THEIR PATRON, TASHA, THE WITCH QUEEN.

### CHAPTER 2 GROUP PATRONS

ACH ADVENTURING GROUP IS BOUND together by the quests it embarks on and by the dangers its members face together. This chapter offers another way to bind vour party together: a group patron. These patrons provide a strong binding element: an individual or an organization that unites a party as a team in service to a greater purpose. A group patron can help set the tone of your party's entire campaign. For example, a group whose patron is an academic institution is likely to have a very different story from a group that serves a military. A patron can influence characters' relationships, their backstories, and the types of dangers they face.

During character creation, every plaver has the opportunity to weave connections between their character and the other members of their party. Rather than (or in addition to) creating a web of established relationships, players can work with the DM to choose a group patron. And if you're interested in being your own patron, see the "Being Your Own Patron" section at the end of the chapter.

### HOW PATRONS WORK

The following sections present several group patron options. The description of each patron provides an overview of the types of organizations the group patron represents, perks of membership, and quests the patron encourages adventurers to undertake.

With the input of your DM, you can customize these patrons to reflect specific establishments in your campaign world or to serve as a launchpad tailored for organizations of your design. For example, the guild group patron could represent the Harpers or the Zhentarim of the Forgotten Realms, the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild in Eberron, or a homebrew league of caravan guards. Or perhaps a criminal syndicate, military force, or other category of patron better fits the party's goals. Choose and customize the group patron that works best for your party and the types of adventures you want to explore.

### GROUP ASSISTANCE

Having a group patron gives an adventuring group a common purpose, which inspires better coordination in the form of guidance and encouragement. As a result of this unity, each member of the party can grant advantage to an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw of another member of the party. To grant advantage in this way, a character and the chosen target must be able to see or hear each other, and neither can be incapacitated. Once a party member grants this advantage, that individual can't do so again until they finish a long rest.

### PERKS

A group patron offers your party a number of perks for your service. These range from standard business arrangements, such as a steady wage and access to staff facilities, to extraordinary boons, such as audiences with powerful figures or exceptions from certain laws. Specific perks are presented in the description of each group patron.

The DM should not feel limited to providing only the perks noted in each group patron's description. Patrons give a party access to solutions and support they wouldn't have otherwise, and a patron can use their varied resources to guide their agents or prepare them for greater adventures.

### ASSIGNMENTS

Your group's patron occasionally offers you an assignment, a mission that provides a springboard for adventure. Of course, it's up to you how you respond to your patron's demands, and interesting stories can result if you decide to refuse an assignment.

A more hands-off patron can still significantly motivate your group. Maybe you seek adventures based on what pleases your patron, possibly earning status and rewards within your organization. An academy, for example, might not organize particular missions, so you hunt down ancient artifacts knowing that your patron will reward you for bringing them back. You have the freedom to chart your own destiny, while letting the patron shape the nature of your group and the adventures you undertake.

### EXAMPLE PATRONS

Here are some of the most likely patrons for an adventuring group. Presented in alphabetical order, these patrons can serve as inspiration for you to create patrons of your own:

Academy Ancient Being Aristocrat Criminal Syndicate Guild Military Force Religious Order Sovereign

### ACADEMY

For all you novice wizards thinking about magic training, seriously consider apprenticing. I know liches who are still paying off their academy loans .

TASHA ·

The world's mysteries are innumerable, but you pursue them with vigor. As operatives for an academy, you seek to unravel the secrets of existence and the deeper riddles beyond.

In your work, you brush shoulders with the wisest in the land, travel to places spoken of in myth, and discover truths beyond imagining. Denying ignorance, you pursue wondrous sights and endlessly unearth new facts. Undiscovered creatures, the covetous dead, and jealous rivals impede your work, but in the pursuit of knowledge, no risk is too great.

### TYPES OF ACADEMIES

Any assemblage of scholars and truth-seekers can function as an academy. Generally, an academy unites a network of learned individuals, allowing them to share their knowledge, further their research, and support common goals. Passing on wisdom to the next generation is part of an academy's mandate, but members find opportunities to undertake far-flung research expeditions-only so much

can be learned in libraries, after all. An academy's focus can be broad or singular, artistic or scientific. mundane or magical. For every topic with unexplored possibilities, an academy seeks to plumb its depths or elevate its study.

Roll or pick from the Academy Type table to determine the institution with which you're aligned.

### ACADEMY TYPE

- de Academy Types
- l Boarding School. Students and faculty enjoy a familial relationship on a self-contained campus.
- 2 Arcane Enclave. Drawn together by cutting-edge magical scholarship, the enclave's residents are hungry for secrets, reagents, and subjects.
- 3 Secret Monastery. Ageless secrets remain the focus of contemplation and rigorous training at this site.
- 4 Elite Institute. This cutthroat college of science or the arts accepts only the crème de la crème of society and talent.
- 5 Vault of Secrets. This conspiracy strives to keep or eradicate all knowledge of a specific truth.
- 6 Museum of Dreams. Magical communication or shared dreamscapes connect a network of wide-ranging specialists.

### ACADEMY PERKS

With an academy as your group's patron, you gain the following perks.

Compensation. The academy pays for the work you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment influences your compensation. On average, the academy pays each member of your group 1 gp per day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Alternatively, you receive a bounty (at least 250 gp) for each artifact or relevant discovery you bring back from your adventures and donate to the academy.

Documentation. Each member of your group has identification denoting your affiliation with the academy. This association carries clout in scholarly or artistic circles. The academy also secures documentation, letters of introduction, and traveling papers if your work requires them. Such documents grant you special status, such as access to forbidden regions or neutral standing in embattled areas. Such identification isn't always a boon, though. In a land frequently plundered by foreigners, your documents could mark you as nothing more than aggrandized looters to some.

Research. Research is part of your group's iob. but your patron also has abundant resources to facilitate such efforts. You can call in a favor to delegate the work of researching lore (a downtime activity described in the Player's Handbook and Xanathar's Guide to Everything) to a colleague, contact, librarian, or research assistant. You're responsible for covering expenses incurred as part of this research, and the DM determines its success or failure.

Resources. Academies host libraries, museums, record repositories, and training facilities, and you can use them to further your work. You can call in a favor from faculty members to access resources not available to the public-dangerous relics or magic items, spellbooks, gear, and the like. Additionally, you can consult with the faculty of your academy as the experts in various fields.

Training. Because you're associated with the academy, you receive a discount on any education you wish to pursue. When you undergo training as a downtime activity (as described in the Player's Handbook or Xanathar's Guide to Everything), you pay half the normal cost, assuming the academy teaches that subject. Training in languages, musical instruments, and other tools is also available, at the DM's discretion. In addition, you can gain proficiency in the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion skills by this method, as if you were learning a language. A character can learn only one of these skills in this way.

### ACADEMY CONTACT

How much autonomy you have in choosing your missions and how often you're expected to perform on the academy's behalf depends largely on your place in the institution's hierarchy. As students, new professors, or support staff, you aid the work of a senior professor or entire department. If you are further along in your career, you have your own goals and assistants, but you still take on assignments to further the goals of esteemed experts, deans, or the academy as a whole. In any of these cases, a specific contact manages your relationship to the academy.

Roll or pick from the Academy Contact table to determine who manages the relationship between you and the academy.

### ACADEMY CONTACT

#### Contact de

- Harried Functionary. A disinterested secretary conl veys written correspondence to you from an exceptionally busy or aloof senior faculty member.
- 2 Celebrated Instructor. Despite their throngs of ambitious assistants, a celebrity researcher considers you their star pupil.
- 3 Wizened Fixture. A fantastically old, believed-to-bedeceased librarian gives you assignments from the circulation desk they never leave.
- Infatuated Tourist. A flirtatious visiting scholar per-4 ceives your every report and donated discovery as a personal gift.
- Spectral Fragment. A haunted piece of the acade-5 my's collection compels you to complete its secret research.
- Distant Observer. A mysterious sponsor encourages e your research from afar to avoid alerting nefarious forces embedded within the academy's bureaucracy.

### ACADEMY FACTOTUMS

If you have an academy as your patron, you are likely engaged in a scholarly pursuit or support someone who is. Consider being a promising student or a new member of the faculty. While you have a modest course load that you handle behind the scenes (or using any of a variety of downtime activities), your primary interests involve aiding your contact in their research. Alternatively, you might work to further the academy's efforts in another way, perhaps related to security or funding.

The Academy Factotum Roles table provides suggestions for functions you perform within an academy and the backgrounds frequently associated with each role.

### ACADEMY QUESTS

The focus of your study and the academy's research defines the missions you undertake. Academics struggle to keep one step ahead of their scholarly rivals, making many of them suspicious of-even hostile toward-other intellectuals. Beyond rivals within their own profession, academics face challenges from their subjects (whether members of lost civilizations or magical beings) or suspicious anti-intellectuals. Not everyone wants to be the subject of scholarly scrutiny or thinks that solving the world's mysteries is important or desirable.

The Academy Quests table presents a few of the sort of endeavors your work or studies lead you to undertake.

### ANCIENT BEING

Any time an unfathomably powerful entity sweeps in and offers godlike rewards in return for just a few teensy favors, it's a scam.

Unless it's me. I'd never lie to you, reader dearest. TASHA

Your group is bound to the designs of an ancient being of tremendous power and influence. You might serve as the creature's eyes and ears in the world, carrying information back to it. Or perhaps you work as its direct agents, enacting its will. Whether you chose this arrangement or were tricked into it, you can count on the strange resources of your benefactor as long as you serve its purpose.

### TYPES OF ANCIENT BEINGS

From brooding dragons to unfathomable voices whispering from the dark, ancient beings guide and empower mortals for inscrutable reasons. The relationship your group has to its patron might be a clearly defined exchange, or it could be uncertain or forceful. Whatever the nature of the being, as long as your group fulfills its role, the being offers rewards.

Roll or pick from the Ancient Being table to determine the being your group serves.

### ANCIENT BEING

- Ancient Being q e
- Elder Dragon. An ancient dragon seeks knowledge 1 or power. It wishes to gather greater wealth for its hoard, its ambitions expanding in its advancing years.
- 2 Lich. An undead spellcaster of immense power employs your group. Its interests are strangely diverse and seemingly benign. Perhaps it's not as evil as conventional adventuring wisdom suggests?
- 3 Bound Fiend. This fiend is bound to a location, either in its true form or as a possessing spirit. Whether trapped in an unbreakable circle of binding sigils or sealed as a spirit within a gigantic statue, the fiend's influence drives your group.
- Guardian Celestial. An angel or another powerful 4 celestial takes an interest in a specific region of the Material Plane. It cultivates a network of mortal informants and agents to serve its agenda.

#### de Ancient Being

- 5 The Endless. This person has lived many lifetimes because they can't die-at least not permanently. No matter the cause of their demise, they return. To all appearances, they are alive and mortal, but they control the amassed resources of an immortal.
- Primal Manifestation. Its existence defies mortal 6 understanding; the being simply is. It could be a primordial force of nature awakened to self-awareness that now inhabits the landscape or an alien intellect that whispers through proxies, omens, and idols.

### ANCIENT BEING PERKS

With the ancient being as your group's patron, you gain the following perks.

Equipment. Your patron's network has access to certain magic items. You can purchase common magic items from your patron contact. The DM determines the available stock or can call for a group Intelligence (Investigation) check to ascertain if the ancient being's network can successfully locate a desired item. The DC for this check is 10 in a city, 15 in a town, and 20 in a village. If the check fails, 1d8 days must pass before the same item can be searched for again in that community.

The DM sets the price of a common magic item or determines it randomly: 2d4 × 10 gp, or half as much for a consumable item such as a potion or scroll.

Research. Relying on an ancient being's network of contacts, the being's vast collection of lore, or perhaps the being's direct teaching helps you unearth hidden secrets. If you can contact your patron or their agents, your group makes ability checks made to research lore related to your patron's interests and influence with advantage.

Sanctuary. Your patron's agents have safe houses or other secure gatherings spread across a wide region. Your group knows how to locate these friendly enclaves and can maintain a modest lifestyle in one for no cost. In return, you must defend the sanctuary or protect the secret of its existence.

Strange Gifts. Your patron grants your group a small measure of esoteric power. At 5th level, and again at 13th, you gain one supernatural gift as described in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The DM determines which supernatural gifts are available.

- 5 Ephemeral Echo. Your contact never physically reveals itself to you. Perhaps it is the ghost of a dead person, an entity that appears outside the flow of time, or a projected illusion of a being that never leaves your patron's hidden sanctum.
- The Mouthpiece. The ancient being's voice whispers 6 through the lips of an ordinary person. You patron might posses the body of a stranger or a party member to converse with you.

### ANCIENT BEING OPERATIVES

Consider the overarching goals of your group's ancient being patron when determining who they recruit as agents. In what arenas does that being likely hold sway? A powerful lich recruits other ambitious spellcasters, as well as skilled warriors to serve as bodyguards. A dragon values socially adept agents and those who influence society's decision-makers. Consider how your capabilities and interests align directly with those of the ancient being, or how you unwittingly fell into the patron's service.

Though their work remains mysterious, ancient beings send their agents to exact their will in myriad ways. Servants of other powerful beings try to stymie your patron's plans, while misguided (or entirely justified) monster hunters seek to rid the world of their ancient foe. An ancient being's lengthy history inspires unusual and potent enemies.

The Ancient Being Quests table presents a few options for the sorts of work your patron expects from you.

TASHA

Your group serves at the pleasure of a member of the nobility. Motivated by money, power, and politics, your patron uses your group to further their agenda without dirtying their hands, or perhaps they send you to the palaces of their enemies as envoys of peace. In exchange for loyalty and discretion, your patron is a powerful ally whose favor bestows far more than gold.

### TYPES OF ARISTOCRATS

From the heads of scheming merchant families to immortal sorcerer-queens, each member of the aristocracy holds a measure of wealth and powerand they desire more. The rulers of a barony could struggle to reclaim the influence they once held, while the new head of a business dynasty might seek to catapult their fortunes to new heights. By aligning with such patrons, you stand to benefit enormously from the fruits of their ambition.

Roll or pick from the Aristocrat Types table to determine what kind of noble you serve.

Expenses. Your patron reimburses you for extraordinary expenses incurred as part of your work. You are required to account for your expenses and must explain any extraordinary expenditures, but routine travel, ordinary equipment, and basic services don't draw a second glance.

Immunity. As long as you remain in the aristocrat's good graces, you are nearly immune to prosecution under the laws within the aristocrat's sphere of influence. When you are carrying out your orders, you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to go about that, and the law isn't an obstacle. Committing serious crimes-especially if they are unrelated or unnecessary for the assigned work-is a sure way to fall out of your patron's good graces, however.

Luxury. Your patron deigns to host you at their home or in other luxurious accommodations for a brief period as reward for a job well done. Such a stay typically lasts for no longer than two weeks per year, during which you maintain an aristocratic lifestyle for no cost.

Salary. Your employment under an aristocratic patron brings an income of 1 gp per day, or enough to maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discretion, your salary increases or decreases depending on the aristocrat's nature, the type of work, and the length of your employment.

### TYPES OF CRIMINAL SYNDICATES

Criminal syndicates range from the local thieves' guild, to a corrupt consortium of merchant princes. to a ring of otherworldly invaders infiltrating all levels of society for a nefarious purpose. Whatever form it takes, the syndicate is largely concerned with increasing wealth for its members at the expense of society at large.

Conversely, the syndicate could be an underground organization of good-hearted people fighting against a wicked power structure.

- 2 Assassin Society. The network's livelihood is death. Members of the society hone their skills as cutthroats, poisoners, body-disposal specialists, and any other profession focused on ending lives. The society is motivated by profit or labors in service to a greater cause.
- 3 Magical Arms Dealer. The syndicate has cornered the market on deadly magical devices. They offer their services and wares for a price and acquire staggering magical might for those who meet their demands.
- 4 Pirate Fleet. This alliance of pirate captains is unified under a ruling captain or admiral and adheres to a strict code of honor. They converge only in response to an outside threat.
- 5 Body Snatchers. The syndicate consists predominantly, if not entirely, of creatures that possess or impersonate other people. They seek to replace influential individuals throughout society with members of their ranks.

### CRIMINAL SYNDICATE PERKS

With the criminal syndicate as your group's patron, you gain the following perks.

Assignments. The syndicate doesn't pay you directly, but it assigns you to particular tasks on behalf of its clients or the organization. Someone hires the syndicate to perform a task (such as an assassination), and the syndicate passes 85 percent of the fee on to your group. If the aim is to enrich the syndicate (such as by pulling off a heist), you have the privilege of keeping 85 percent of what you steal. Other syndicates take more or less than a 15 percent share, at the DM's discretion.

Contraband. You have access to your syndicate's business in contraband, such as poisons or narcotics. You don't receive a discount on these goods, but you can always find someplace to purchase them.

Fences. Members or associates of your syndicate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and you have access to this service as well. Fences are useful for selling not just illicit goods but also expensive items such as works of art and magic items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to delegate the work of finding a buyer (a downtime activity described in the Dungeon Master's Guide and Xanathar's Guide to Everything) to the fence. When using the syndicate's fences, you run no risk of a double-cross or other mishap in finding a buyer, but the syndicate takes 20 percent of the sale price as a finder's fee.

Safe Houses. The syndicate maintains safe houses or other secret hiding spots across a wide region. Your group knows how to locate these nondescript redoubts and can maintain a poor lifestyle in one for no cost. Revealing a safe house, whether purposefully or by accident, causes you to lose favor with the syndicate and may see you banned from using them.

Syndicate-Owned Businesses. The syndicate owns several businesses, primarily as fronts for laundering money. When you buy from one of these businesses, you get a 5 percent discount. The DM decides what goods and services are available.

### CRIMINAL SYNDICATE CONTACT

Each member of the syndicate has a place in the organization. You report to a contact who handles your contribution by giving you assignments, collecting the syndicate's cut of your swag, or seeing that you receive your fee for contract work from outside clients. The contact is your first point of communication if you need to reach out to highly ranked members of the syndicate's hierarchy.

Roll or pick from the Syndicate Contact table to determine your contact within a criminal organization.

### SYNDICATE CONTACT

- Clever Urchin. An innocuous person, perhaps a beg-2 gar or menial laborer, knows all the right people and shares their connections with you.
- 3 Former Law Enforcement. Your contact used to be (or maybe still is) a member of local law enforcement. They have sharp insight into the law's workings in your area and a healthy dose of paranoia for that reason.
- Bon Vivant. The boss of a local den of vice-4 whether gambling, narcotics, or other pleasuresaids you when they're not distracted by their own debauchery.
- Traitor. You know your contact in the syndicate has 5 betrayed it, but they have enough clout and leverage that you don't dare cross them-yet.
- Criminal Royalty. Unknown to most, your contact 6 is a member of local nobility or royalty. Why they maintain relations with the syndicate is a troubling mystery.

### CRIMINAL SYNDICATE MEMBERS

Whether you're a lifelong scoundrel or an ambitious upstart, you seek to gain wealth, fame, and influence within a criminal syndicate. A syndicate is motivated by profit, employing agents with all manner of talents. Nimbleness and novelty prove vital not just to exploiting untapped prospects but to avoiding the law. You embody rare experience and skill, positioned at the forefront of daring new criminal ventures.

### CRIMINAL SYNDICATE OUESTS

Your work as a syndicate member involves more than simple street swindles or pickpocketing. Someone with your skills cooperates with others for greater purposes that offer both dangerous risks and splendid rewards. The law of the land is your most persistent enemy, but other criminal syndicates challenge you as well-or become your targets.

The Criminal Syndicate Ouests table explores what kind of work you do for the organization.

### CRIMINAL SYNDICATE QUESTS

### GUILD

There's power in groups. One bee's a pest, but noboal messes with the swarm.

Your group has ties to a powerful consortium of professionals who work together for mutual benefit. You might be long-time members of such a guild, descended from a family of crafters or merchants from which you inherited membership, or perhaps you're working to earn entrance on your own merits. If you serve the guild's interests well, it promises to take care of you. Guilds hate to waste valuable assets, after all-that's just bad business.

### TYPES OF GUILD

The guild structure covers a swath of business ventures, differentiated by their specialty. A conglomerate of blacksmiths, jewelers, carpenters, tailors, alchemists, scribes, and sages all could organize as a guild. Whatever their trade, these experts share contacts, exchange resources such as materials or tools, and leverage their collective influence to affect politics for their benefit. Alternatively, merchants and other business owners might also organize into guilds. Merchant barons who effectively rule a city or nation through iron-clad control of the economy or a network of innkeepers who share news and supply routes could both represent guild patrons. A guild could even embody a more sinister group, such as one that deals in terrifying wares like deadly monsters, dangerous knowledge, or souls.

Roll or pick from the Guild Types table to determine the general sort of organization you operate within.

### GUILD TYPES

de Guild

- Crafters' Guild. This conglomerate of artisans pools l its resources and influence to ensure a steady exchange of gold for its crafts.
- Merchant Consortium. These entrepreneurs don't 2 create the wares they peddle, instead specializing in linking products to prospective owners. If they don't have it, they find it.
- Miracle Makers' Association. The magically inclined 3 crafters of this guild specialize in imbuing physical goods with magical effects. Rumor has it they can strip the magic from existing enchanted items and might be willing to buy or trade adventurers' spoils.
- 4 Moneychangers. These merchants deal in all forms of currency, acting as bankers, loan agents, and crucial contacts for adventurers and other individuals who deal with large sums of wealth. They exchange coin for gemstones as readily as they find buyers for historical relics and recovered art.
- Philosophical Faction. These like-minded individuals 5 follow specific teachings, spreading word of their expertise through their services and training.
- 6 Identity Traders. These enigmatic dealers buy and sell documents, memories, and the trappings of thoroughly lived lives, selling them to those in need of the ultimate fresh start.

### GUILD PERKS

With a guild as your group's patron, you gain the following perks. These perks require an annual contribution of 15 gp paid to the guild (replacing the 5 gp per month cost for characters with the Guild Artisan background). These dues fund the guild's services and activities.

Accommodations. You can stay at your organization's guildhall. The rooms are comparable to those in a comfortable inn, but at a modest price (5 sp per day).

Equipment. You can requisition the use of specialized tools, laboratories, libraries, or other crafting space and equipment to use within the guildhall. When you make an ability check with a set of artisan's tools using the guild's equipment, add double your normal proficiency bonus to the check.

Resources. You can leverage the guild's extensive contacts to locate exotic materials for crafting. spell components, or magic items, or buyers for them (a downtime activity in the Dungeon Master's Guide and Xanathar's Guide to Everything). You

can locate or sell legal commodities using the guild's resources, and any prices tip in your favor by 10 percent.

Training. The guild retains knowledgeable tutors in subjects pertinent to its interests. When you undertake the training downtime activity (as described in the Player's Handbook and Xanathar's Guide to Everything), the training takes half as long if you are studying a subject the guild specializes in. The DM decides if the guild has tutors available for a given subject.

### GUILD CONTACT

Even as a member in good standing of the guild, you can't simply stroll up to the guild master and demand their attention. Your superiors within the guild manage work contracts, request the use of guild resources, and facilitate getting your group in contact with the right people to assist their interests.

Roll or pick from the Guild Contact table to determine your immediate contact within the guild.

### GUILD CONTACT

#### de Contact

- l The Perfectionist. Your contact is a skilled but obsessive creator consumed with the quest to create something perfect that will define their life's work and secure their legacy. They lose sight of right and wrong in pursuit of the finest materials and exciting opportunities.
- 2 Attentive Overseer. A guild representative takes personal interest in your group's tasks. They follow your exploits and know of your adventures before you return to report. Despite the unsettling depth of their knowledge, they seem genuinely eager to shepherd your work.
- Hidden Benefactor. Whoever your contact is, they 3 don't communicate directly. They send messages via couriers or letters. No one in the guild knows who the contact is, or if they do, they aren't telling you. Regardless, the contact's information is good, and they pay on time.
- 4 Discerning Mentor. No matter how well you perform, or how perfect your creations, nothing is ever good enough for this contact. They point out every flaw and missed opportunity. Are they bitter, lashing out at anyone around them, or do they recognize your potential and try to push you to greatness?
- 5 Golem Guide. Your guild contact is the soul of a long-dead artisan preserved in a construct body. This golem is wise and knowledgeable, but it has difficulty grasping the passage of time and the state of the world compared to its original era.
- 6 Fallen Muse. Your contact is a fallen celestial. Whether they regret their transgressions or hunger for vengeance, they provide divine inspiration and guidance to you and to the guild. Somehow your group and the guild inspire their hope for ascension.

### GUILD REPRESENTATIVES

As a guild member, you might be a professional who works directly toward the guild's specialty or whose fortunes align with the guild's interests. Alternatively, you could provide the guild with services to which their members aren't suited. For example, guards, explorers, negotiators, and spies can be useful to a guild, whether its interests lie in trade goods, entertainment, or more questionable ventures. Whether a guild operates entirely within the law and how public its interests are also influences which of your skills it deems most valuable.

The Guild Representative Roles table suggests positions you might fill in a guild and the backgrounds frequently associated with each role.

As a member of the guild, you're called on to ply your skills in the organization's service.

The Guild Quests table presents a few options for the sorts of work the guild requires of you.

### GUILD QUESTS

- The Bill Comes Due. Your guild master achieved 6 their vaunted position by means of an otherworldly bargain. That price has come due, and they are desperate to avoid paying. You must defeat whatever's coming to collect the master's debt or find another acceptable payment.

### MILITARY FORCE

The whole machine of war is barbaric. In a sane world, conflicts would be resolved by contests of apocalyptic magics or by continentreshaping brawls between titanic, soul-fueled reptiles. You know, reasonable options.

TASHA

Your group serves as a team of soldiers in a larger military force, one dedicated to combat missions or other dangerous tasks. You could be a band of mercenaries, a special forces unit, or a squad of regular infantry. Perhaps you protect a nation's people from monsters, or you fight secret battles in the wake of a war that has supposedly ended. Or the nation requires military forces at the edges of civilization to protect the frontier and to lead advancement into new territory.

### TYPES OF MILITARY FORCES

Military forces represent a variety of organized bands of warriors. They can be the disciplined regiments of a nation's standing army, a fleet of ships comprising a kingdom's armada, or a devastating horde of warriors and magical beasts. A given kingdom's military could be a rigidly ordered force or a blood-soaked throng.

Roll or pick from the Military Force Types table to determine the general type of military patron you serve.

#### Military Organization de

- Mercenary Company. Hard-bitten veterans of nu-2 merous conflicts, mercenaries serve an employer for coin rather than out of loyalty.
- Expeditionary Force. This military force is far from 3 home, fighting behind enemy lines or striking into wild, unsettled lands. The force must be fast, self-sufficient, and either diplomatic or decisive to assure their survival.
- Horde. The horde is almost a force of nature, and 4 what it lacks in discipline it makes up in ferocity. It doesn't have a rigid command structure, instead functioning like a pyramid of smaller armies. Horde commanders owe fealty to stronger leaders above them, all the way up to the warlord.
- Planar Conscripts. This military force battles for cos-5 mic stakes on far-flung planes of the multiverse or fights against extraplanar invasion on the Material Plane. Warriors include conscripts pressed into service in the Blood War, fodder in the thrall of ruthless yugoloth mercenaries, or members of a glorious celestial host defending against fiendish incursion.
- Sky Warriors. This military force consists of winged 6 creatures, employs magical flight, or sails airships as a sky navy. Traditional defenses are ineffective against attacks from the air, positioning the sky warriors as a fearsome nation or expensive and coveted mercenaries.

### MILITARY FORCE PERKS

With a military force as your group's patron, you gain the following perks.

Armory. You can purchase nonmagical weapons and armor at a 20 percent discount at a facility associated with your military force. You can buy magic items at the DM's discretion, but you receive no discount.

a repository of top-secret intelligence. You can also request that your commander grant you authority to act in their name or provide access to experts or leaders higher in the chain of command.

Orders. You undertake your missions at the direction of a commanding officer, who expects your absolute obedience. These missions have clear and precise goals, leading you on the path of adventure. In rare cases, you're trusted with open-ended tasks that afford you leeway in interpreting orders.

Salary. Each member of your group earns a regular salary or share of the military force's spoils. The amount varies depending on your organization and your position within it, but at minimum you enjoy a modest lifestyle. You receive a small salary (as little as 1 sp per day) and food and housing on a military base. Or you receive 1 gp per day but rely on that money for room and board. With higher rank comes higher pay. As an officer, you maintain a comfortable lifestyle.

### MILITARY FORCE CONTACT

- Taskmaster. This angry officer yells every order, 2 reprimands you for the smallest mistake, and fully expects you to fail at every mission you undertake. This might be tough love or simple brutishness.
- Protective Officer. A kindly officer is hesitant to send 3 you into danger and constantly reminds you to be careful.
- 4 Bitter Soldier. Your commander carries deep grudges against your force's enemies. They leap at any chance to do those foes harm, even if it puts your group in terrible risk.

Your missions could run the risk of shattering a fragile peace recently established with a rival nation and plunging multiple nations back into war.

Rival mercenary companies, armed resistance fighters, and monsters drawn to the presence of bloodshed also present familiar threats.

### TYPES OF RELIGIOUS ORDERS

Not every religious order represents an alliance of worshipers devoted to godly ideals. Perhaps your group is a team of devotees pursuing a cause for vour faith, or maybe you're a bunch of cynics taking advantage of a wealthy congregation. Your collective faith could compel vou to hunt evil monsters or stave off otherworldly invasions, to protect the powerless from oppression, or to spread the teachings of your religion in a hostile land. Or perhaps you serve a corrupt hierarchy by making its enemies quietly disappear-though even cynical mercenaries can become true believers when confronted with the miraculous.

### RELIGIOUS ORDER QUESTS

The services you provide your religious order vary depending on the deity you serve and your party's aptitudes. Regardless, religious orders are opposed by antagonistic faiths, foes whose rivalry with your order emulates the conflict between your respective gods. Some religious orders also hunt and destroy fiends, undead, or other beings they consider abominations, seeking to rid the word of their influence. Others root out heretics, real or imagined, to demonstrate the primacy of their deity.

The Religious Order Quests table presents a few examples of how you can honor and serve your deity.

### RELIGIOUS ORDER QUESTS

### SOVEREIGN

I never had much interest in ruling, partly because the titles all sound so stuffy. But "witch queen" has a lovely ring to it, don't you think?

TASHA

A leader without allies is not long a leader. You serve a sovereign-a national figure or otherwiseand work to achieve their goals no matter the cost.

As agents of a sovereign, you serve as diplomats or enforcers, spies or fixers, bringers of aid or executors of justice. You work within the system to uphold the status quo or step beyond the law to prevent war and worse. Politics, espionage, and mystery are facts of your world, as is hope and the fragile promise of peace.

### TYPES OF SOVEREIGNS

Broadly defined, a sovereign ranges from the head of a government to the leader of a powerful, private institution. Queens, chieftains, sultans, and rajahs are ready choices for powerful individuals who patronize a party of adventurers. Those on track to become such individuals-such as cunning senators, royal heirs, or influential celebrities-also fill a sovereign's role. When choosing or creating a sovereign to serve, consider whether that leader commands a government organization or another faction. While

IOO

this section assumes your patron is the head of a country or other national body, they could oversee a powerful private division, a cult of personality, or an elaborate expedition. Also, consider the scale of your patron's organization. While serving as spies engaging in international intrigues could lead to world-changing escapades, being fixers for the mayor of a struggling town offers a personal connection to a place and its people.

Roll or pick from the Sovereign Types table to determine what sort of liege you serve.

### SOVEREIGN TYPES

#### de Sovereign

- ] Village Elder. The wizened leader of a community offers both civic and moral leadership.
- 2 Young Noble. An ambitious noble eagerly seeks to reform society to align with a personal vision.

### SOVEREIGN PERKS

With the sovereign as your group's patron, you gain the following perks.

Elite Access. While in service to the sovereign, you have access to the highest echelons of society. With your patron's permission, you can gain access to the halls of power, from national capitols and military headquarters to noble estates and troves of state secrets. You can also request that the sovereign grant you access to perks of their position, like access to diplomatic receptions or use of the royal guards.

Expenses. Your patron reimburses you for extraordinary expenses incurred as part of your work. You are required to account for your expenses and must explain any extraordinary expenditures, but routine travel, ordinary equipment, and basic services don't draw a second glance.

MERFOLK SOVEREIGN

Immunity. As long as you remain in the sovereign's good graces, you are nearly immune to prosecution under the laws within their sphere of influence. When you are carrying out your orders, you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to go about that, and the law isn't an obstacle. Committing serious crimes-especially if they are unrelated or unnecessary for the assigned work-is a sure way to fall out of your patron's good graces, however.

Salary. Your employment under a sovereign patron brings an income of 1 gp per day, or enough to maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discretion, your salary increases or decreases depending on the sovereign's nature, the type of work you perform, and the length of your employment.

You might benefit from direct contact with your group patron. This includes audiences or secret meetings with the sovereign, depending on the nature of your work. Alternatively, the sovereign might purposefully want to keep their distance from you. either due to their busy schedules or to maintain plausible deniability regarding your work. In such cases, an advisor or functionary oversees your assignments, serving as the primary contact between you and the sovereign.

Roll or pick from the Sovereign Contact table to determine who manages the relationship between you and the throne, if not the sovereign directly.

### SOVEREIGN CONTACT

#### 9e Contact

- 7 Intimate Confidant. The sovereign's friend or lover seeks to aid their companion in any way possible.
- Spymaster. An intelligence operative attends to the 2 nation's dirty work so the sovereign keeps their hands clean.
- 3 Administrator. This severe bureaucrat disagrees with many of the sovereign's policies but takes loyal service seriously.
- 4 Executive Assistant. The responsibilities of an exacting butler or other servant at the royal household far exceed their title.
- 5 Envoy. A semi-retired, leisure-loving ambassador speaks in suggestion and innuendo.
- 6 Spectral Assembly. A ghostly council of the nation's previous regents manifests to avert disasters.

### SOVEREIGN PROXIES

You serve a sovereign out of national pride, out of tradition, or for your own practical reasons. The needs of a leader potentially embroil you directly in political intrigues, court maneuverings, or threats from national foes. It's up to you and the sovereign to determine whether your work is publicly acknowledged or top secret-and if the latter, what happens if your work is exposed.

The Sovereign Proxy Roles table suggests ways you might serve a sovereign and the backgrounds frequently associated with each role.

### SOVEREIGN QUESTS

The services you provide a sovereign largely depend on the nature of your group patron and their nation. While some of your missions involve official tasksmissions undertaken in the sovereign's name-others might be covert, making your patron's identity a highly guarded secret. Political rivals, enemy countries, and natural disasters all pose dangers to the sovereign's nation. Yet a sovereign who sows chaos, enacts tyrannical decrees, or jeopardizes a population's way of life is likely to inspire rebellions. In such cases, a sovereign's agents must decide where their loyalties lie.

The Sovereign Quests table presents a few of the sorts of missions you undertake for your liege.

### SOVEREIGN QUESTS

#### de Quest

- 1 International Espionage. You attempt to steal intelligence, national symbols, or super weapons from an enemy power.
- 2 Undermine Rival. You seek to weaken or remove a rival to the regent's rule-perhaps a general, an archdruid, or a noble with a claim to the throne.
- 3 Expel Corruption. You help the sovereign reform their government, rooting out institutional vices.
- 4 Subvert Blame. The sovereign is caught in an embarrassing affair. Make it disappear.
- Test Heir. You prepare the sovereign's heir for the 5 challenge of taking the throne.
- 6 Desperate Diplomacy. You seek to make peace with a force or entity that could wipe out your nation.

### BEING YOUR OWN PATRON

For some players, the idea of running a crime syndicate, mercenary company, arcane scholars' collective, or other organization is far more exciting than working for someone else. Founding your own organization offers a greater degree of autonomy, though potentially at the cost of support and reliable work.

When you're the boss, the perks of belonging to an organization become expenses you have to worry about; when you run your own mercenary company, for example, you need to stock your own armory, rather than drawing on an existing organization's stockpile. The organization brings in income, but you'll have to spend it to keep the organization running.

When you run your own organization, use the Running a Business downtime activity (described in the Dungeon Master's Guide) to reflect your organization's ongoing activities. More than one character can take part in this activity at a time. When rolling to determine the business's performance, add the total days spent by the characters to the roll to determine the business's success (still observing the maximum of 30). If the business earns a profit, multiply that profit by 4 + the number of characters who took part in this downtime activity.

Don't discount the value of adopting an NPC to serve as your contact within your own organization. A secretary, majordomo, or apprentice keeps up with your group's bureaucracy while you're conducting missions and passes along information that could lead to your next adventure!

### CHAPTER 3 MAGICAL MISCELLANY

AGIC IS EVERYWHERE IN D&D. MANY creatures in the D&D multiverse exist solely because of the influence of magic, spellcasters harness magical energy every day in the form of spells, and supernatural power thrums at the heart of the magic items sought by adventurers. This chapter is all about those last two things-spells and magic items.

The chapter first presents new spells for player characters and monsters to use. Those spells are followed by suggestions on customizing the look of your spells. The chapter then offers a selection of new magic items, including artifacts of mythic power and magic items that can be printed on one's body in the form of tattoos.

The DM decides how the options in this chapter appear in a campaign and may choose to use some, all, or none of them, so make sure to let your DM know which options you'd most like to use in play.

### SPELLS

Well, darn. Whatever could have happened to the spells Mordenkainen's Bountiful Back-Patting, Heward's Hot Air, and all the rest? I'm sure I submitted the spells they insisted I include herein. Seems they got lost in the shuffle. Shame.

TASHA

This section contains new spells that the DM may add to a campaign, making them available to player character and monster spellcasters alike. The Spells table lists the new spells, ordering them by level. The table also notes the school of magic of a spell, whether it requires concentration. whether it bears the ritual tag, and which classes have access to it.

If you'd like to use any of these spells, talk to your DM, who may allow some, all, or none of them.

### SPELLS

### SPELL DESCRIPTIONS

The spells are presented in alphabetical order.

### BLADE OF DISASTER

9th-level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: 60 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a blade-shaped planar rift about 3 feet long in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The blade lasts for the duration. When you cast this spell, you can make up to two melee spell attacks with the blade, each one against a creature, loose object, or structure within 5 feet of the blade. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage. This attack scores a critical hit if the number on the d20 is 18 or higher. On a critical hit, the blade deals an extra 8d12 force damage (for a total of 12d12 force damage).

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and then make up to two melee spell attacks with it again.

The blade can harmlessly pass through any barrier, including a wall of force.

### BOOMING BLADE

Evocation cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (5-foot radius) Components: S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp) Duration: 1 round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.

This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).

### DREAM OF THE BLUE VEIL

7th-level conjuration

Casting Time: 10 minutes Range: 20 feet Components: V, S, M (a magic item or a willing creature from the destination world) Duration: 6 hours

### TRAVELING TO OTHER WORLDS

The Material Plane holds an infinite number of worlds. Some-like Oerth, Toril, Krynn, and Eberron-are well documented, but there are countless others. You and your friends may even have created some homemade D&D worlds yourselves!

It was not always so. Various scholars speak of a primordial state, a single reality they call the First World, which preceded the multiverse as we know it. Many of the peoples and monsters that inhabit the worlds in the Material Plane originated there. After the First World was shattered by a great cataclysm-giving birth to the worlds that came in its wake-the progeny of the first elves, dwarves, beholders, and other iconic creatures took root on world after world, like seeds scattered by a cosmic wind. If the musings of these great sages are true, every world is a reflection-and in some cases, a distortion-of the First World.

Transit between these worlds is rare but not impossible and can be accomplished in various ways. One such method is called the Great Journey, an epic voyage fraught with peril and littered with obstacles to be overcome. This journey most often occurs aboard a vessel powered by magic.

Another method is the Dream of Other Worlds; travelers fall into a deep slumber and dream themselves into a new realm. The spell dream of the blue veil employs this method of transit.

The most direct method is the Leap to Another Realm; a spellcaster casts teleportation circle or teleport, aiming to appear in a known teleportation circle or some other location in another world.

Whatever method you use to reach a world, the DM determines whether you succeed and where exactly you appear if you do arrive in that realm.

You and up to eight willing creatures within range fall unconscious for the spell's duration and experience visions of another world on the Material Plane, such as Oerth, Toril, Krynn, or Eberron. If the spell reaches its full duration, the visions conclude with each of you encountering and pulling back a mysterious blue curtain. The spell then ends with you mentally and physically transported to the world that was in the visions.

To cast this spell, you must have a magic item that originated on the world you wish to reach, and you must be aware of the world's existence, even if you don't know the world's name. Your destination in the other world is a safe location within 1 mile of where the magic item was created. Alternatively, you can cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was born on the other world, which causes your destination to be a safe location within 1 mile of where that creature was born.

The spell ends early on a creature if that creature takes any damage, and the creature isn't transported. If you take any damage, the spell ends for you and all the other creatures, with none of you being transported.

### GREEN-FLAME BLADE

Evocation cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (5-foot radius) Components: S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)

### Duration: Instantaneous

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 2d8) and 17th level (3d8 and 3d8).

### INTELLECT FORTRESS

3rd-level abjuration

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet

### Components: V

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

For the duration, you or one willing creature you can see within range has resistance to psychic damage, as well as advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

### LIGHTNING LURE

Evocation cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (15-foot radius) Components: V Duration: Instantaneous

You create a lash of lightning energy that strikes at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you and then take 1d8 lightning damage if it is within 5 feet of you.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

ECT FORTE

MIND SLIVER Enchantment cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: V Duration: 1 round

You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

SPIRIT SHROUD 3rd-level necromancy

Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: Self Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You call forth spirits of the dead, which flit around you for the spell's duration. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable.

Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals 1d8 extra damage when you hit a creature within 10 feet of you. This damage is radiant, necrotic, or cold (your choice when you cast the spell). Any creature that takes this damage can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

In addition, any creature of your choice that you can see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.

### PERSONALIZING SPELLS

When I first learned magic from Baba Yaga, I couldn't help but add spectral chicken leas to all my spells. She said she wasn't a fan, but I caught her grinning a few times. So of course I still add those leas. What use is magic if you can't harness it to amuse your mom? TASHA

lust as every performer lends their art a personal flair and every warrior asserts their fighting styles through the lens of their own training, so too can a spellcaster use magic to express their individuality. Regardless of what type of spellcaster you're playing, you can customize the cosmetic effects of your character's spells. Perhaps you wish the effects of your caster's spells to appear in their favorite color, to suggest the training they received from a celestial mentor, or to exhibit their connection to a season of the year. The possibilities for how you might cosmetically customize your character's spells are endless. However, such alterations can't change the effects of a spell. They also can't make one spell seem like another-you can't, for example, make a magic missile look like a fireball.

When customizing your spellcaster's magic, consider developing a theme-often, the broader and more versatile the better. You may describe your caster's magic whenever you wish, particularly when it makes an interesting addition to a story. You may also use it to reinforce other choices you've made for your character, like making a bard's spells tied more closely to their favored art form or a cleric's spells themed around their deity.

For example, the fireball of a wizard with a fondness for storms might erupt to look like burning clouds or a burst of red lightning (without affecting the spell's damage type), while the same wizard's haste spell might limn the target in faint thunderheads.

Alternatively, a cleric who serves a moon god might radiate faint moonlight around their hands when they cast cure wounds, or their shield of faith might surround the target with glimmering crescent moons.

Further still, a druid could choose a cherry blossom theme for their magic, causing delicate branches and pink leaves to grow when they cast entangle or shillelagh, and their faerie fire spell could appear more like wind-tossed petals than flames.

The Magic Themes table offers just a few suggestions that might inspire you while personalizing your character's spells.

### MAGIC ITEMS

Who doesn't love magic items? The desire for them is one of the few things Mordenkainen and I have in common. And magic tattoos-they're especially fun. I think tattoos are a reason robes are so popular with wizards. Robes cover the ankle and lower-back tattoos so many of us got as apprentices. Don't even ask .

TASHA

This section presents magic items that can be introduced into any campaign. Here vou'll find items of all rarities, including artifacts. Magic spellcasting focuses for every spellcasting class are also available here. And some of the items in this section represent a new type of wondrous item: magic tattoos.

The Magic Items table lists all the magic items in this chapter and notes the rarity of each one. The table also indicates whether an item requires attunement. All the items use the magic items rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

### MAGIC TATTOOS

Blending magic and artistry with ink and needles, magic tattoos imbue their bearers with wondrous abilities. Magic tattoos are initially bound to magic needles, which transfer their magic to a creature.

Once inscribed on a creature's body, damage or injury doesn't impair the tattoo's function, even if the tattoo is defaced. When applying a magic tattoo, a creature can customize the tattoo's appearance. A magic tattoo can look like a brand, scarification, a birthmark, patterns of scale, or any other cosmetic alteration.

The rarer a magic tattoo is, the more space it typically occupies on a creature's skin. The Magic Tattoo Coverage table offers guidelines for how large a given tattoo is.

### MAGIC TATTOO COVERAGE

| Tattoo Rarity | Area Covered |

| Common | One hand or foot or a quarter of a limb |
| Uncommon | Half a limb or the scalp |
| Rare | One limb |

### MAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS

The following magic items are presented in alphabetical order.

### ABSORBING TATTOO

### Wondrous item (tattoo), very rare (requires attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo features designs that emphasize one color.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Damage Resistance. While the tattoo is on your skin, you have resistance to a type of damage associated with that color, as shown on the table below. The DM chooses the color or determines it randomly.

| d10 | Damage Type | Color |
| --- | --- | --- |

|  | Lightning | Yellow |
| 6 | Necrotic | Black |
| 7 | Poison | Violet |
| 8 | Psychic | Silver |
| 9 | Radiant | Gold |
| 10 | Thunder | Orange |

### BABA YAGA'S MORTAR AND PESTLE

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.

Random Properties. This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:

- · 2 minor beneficial properties
- · 1 major beneficial property
- · 1 minor detrimental property

Properties of the Mortar. The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size. meaning it can hold even a Large creature.

Properties of the Pestle. The pestle is a 6-inchlong, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Perfect Tools. While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

You can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.

Primal Parts. As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points

BARA YAGA'S MORTAE ND PESTIE FOR A SPIN

to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.

Traverse the Night. If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.

Bones Know Their Home. When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.

Destroying the Mortar and Pestle. The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga or by Baba Yaga herself.

### BLOODWELL VIAL

Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a sorcerer)

To attune to this vial, you must place a few drops of your blood into it. The vial can't be opened while your attunement to it lasts. If your attunement to the vial ends, the contained blood turns to ash. You can use the vial as a spellcasting focus for your spells while wearing or holding it, and you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your sorcerer spells. The bonus is determined by the vial's rarity.

In addition, when you roll any Hit Dice to recover hit points while you are carrying the vial, you can regain 5 sorcery points. This property of the vial can't be used again until the next dawn.

### CAULDRON OF REBIRTH

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a druid or warlock)

This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast iron sides.

The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 3d6 force damage and be grappled by you. As an action, the creature can escape the grapple by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The grapple also ends if you halt it (no action required), if the creature is ever more than 15 feet away from you, or if you use this tattoo on a different creature.

### CROOK OF RAO

### Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao-potentially for the final time.

Random Properties. The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:

- · 2 minor beneficial properties
- · 1 major beneficial property
- · 1 minor detrimental property

CROOK OF RAO

Spells. The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2 charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

Absolute Banishment. While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years.

Failing Matrix. Whenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.

### EXTRAPLANAR REVERSAL

| d100 | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1-25 | A portal to a random plane opens. The portal |
|  | closes after 5 minutes. |
| 26-45 | 2d4 imps and 2d4 quasits appear. |
| 46-60 | 1d8 succubi/incubi appear. |
| 61-70 | 1d10 barbed devils and 1d10 vrocks appear. |
| 71-80 | 1 arcanoloth, 1 night hag, and 1 rakshasa |
|  | appear. |
| 81-85 | 1 ice devil and 1 marilith appear. |
| 86-90 | 1 balor and 1 pit fiend appear. At the DM's |
|  | discretion, a portal opens into the presence of |
|  | an archdevil or demon lord instead, then closes |
|  | after 5 minutes. |
| 00 10 | Igawily's Curca lean the laquility's Curca |

91-00 lggwilv's Curse (see the Iggwilv's Curse property).

Iggwilv's Curse. When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.

Destroying or Repairing the Crook. The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.

### CRYSTALLINE CHRONICLE

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)

An etched crystal sphere the size of a grapefruit hums faintly and pulses with irregular flares of inner light. While you are touching the crystal, you can retrieve and store information and spells within the crystal at the same rate as reading and writing. When found, the crystal contains the following spells: detect thoughts, intellect fortress, * Rary's telepathic bond, sending, telekinesis, Tasha's mind whip,* and Tenser's floating disk (spells with an asterisk appear in this book). It functions as a

> CRYSTALLINE CHRONICLE

spellbook for you, with its spells and other writing psychically encoded within it.

While you are holding the crystal, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and you know the mage hand, mind sliver (appears in this book), and message cantrips if you don't already know them.

The crystal has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- · If you spend 1 minute studying the information within the crystal, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book.
- · When you cast a wizard spell, you can expend 1 charge to cast the spell without verbal, somatic, or material components of up to 100 gp value.

### DEMONOMICON OF IGGWILV

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss's infinite layers and inhabitants, the Demonomicon of Iggwilv is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.

Random Properties. The artifact has the follow random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:

- · 2 minor beneficial properties
- · 1 minor detrimental property
- · 1 major detrimental property

Spells. The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast Tasha's hideous laughter from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: magic circle (1 charge), magic jar (3 charges), planar ally (3 charges), planar binding (2 charges), plane shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), summon fiend (3 charges; appears in this book).

Abyssal Reference. You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.

DEMONOMICON OF IGGWILV

Fiendish Scourging. Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.

Ensnarement. While carrying the book, whenever you cast the magic circle spell naming only fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.

Containment. The first 10 pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon's empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you finish a long rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the

closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days.

When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.

Destroying the Demonomicon. To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation for the Demonomicon. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu instantly knows.

### DEVOTEE'S CENSER

Weapon (flail), rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)

The rounded head of this flail is perforated with tiny holes, arranged in symbols and patterns. The flail counts as a holy symbol for you. When you hit with an attack using this magic flail, the target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

As a bonus action, you can speak the command word to cause the flail to emanate a thin cloud of incense out to 10 feet for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, you and any other creatures in the incense each regain 1d4 hit points. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- · If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the illusion school.
- · When a creature you can see makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern the true nature of an illusion spell you cast, or makes a saving throw against an illusion spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the roll.

### ELDRITCH CLAW TATTOO

Wondrous item (tattoo), uncommon (requires attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo depicts clawlike forms and other jagged shapes.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player's Handbook. If the result is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

If you don't have the Wild Magic Sorcerous Origin, once this property is used to roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### LUBA'S TAROKKA OF SOULS

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.

Created by a figure of Vistani legend, Luba's Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarroka deck. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foulas it inevitably will.

LUBA'S TAROKKA OF SOULS

Like all tarokka decks, the Tarokka of Souls is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.

Random Properties. The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:

- · 2 minor detrimental properties
- · 2 minor beneficial properties

Spells. While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: comprehend languages, detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, locate object, or scrying. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.

Enduring Vision. While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells.

Twist of Fate. As an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:

Weal. The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.

Woe. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.

The deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.

Prisoners of Fate. Whenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll d100 and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the Monster Manual. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.

The released soul appears at a random location within 10d10 miles of you and terrorizes the living. Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck's Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe.

Shuffling Fate. If you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba's Tarroka of Souls ends, and you can't attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you.

Destroying the Deck. Luba's Tarokka of Souls can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a lich, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka deck, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM's design.

### MOTHER LUBA AND THE VISTANI

The creator of the Tarokka of Souls. Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.

A halfling Vistani. Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. "We may wander amid the shadows," Mother Luba said. "But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers."

Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.

#### LYRE OF BUILDING

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)

While holding this lyre, you can cast mending as an action. You can also play the lyre as a reaction when an object or a structure you can see within 300 feet of you takes damage, causing it to be immune to that damage and any further damage of the same type until the start of your next turn.

In addition, you can play the lyre as an action to cast fabricate, move earth, passwall, or summon construct (appears in this book), and that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.

### MASQUERADE TATTOO

### Wondrous item (tattoo), common (requires attunement)

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo appears on your body as whatever you desire.

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

Fluid Ink. As a bonus action, you can shape the tattoo into any color or pattern and move it to any area of your skin. Whatever form it takes, it is always obviously a tattoo. It can range in size from no smaller than a copper piece to an intricate work of art that covers all your skin.

Disguise Self. As an action, you can use the tattoo to cast the disguise self spell (DC 13 to discern the disguise). Once the spell is cast from the tattoo, it can't be cast from the tattoo again until the next dawn.

### MIGHTY SERVANT OF LEUK-O

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.

Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, of ten referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the Machine of Lum the Mad. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the Mind of Metal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.

Dangerous Attunement. Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.

The servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.

Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.

MIGHTY SERVANT OF LEUK-O

Controlling the Servant. While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.

A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.

While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:

- · Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)
- · Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)
- · As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.
- · When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.

While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.

Ghost in the Machine. Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.

If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20

Immutable Existence. The servant is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form or send it to another plane of existence.

Magic Resistant Construction. The servant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks made against it have disadvantage.

Regeneration. The servant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, this trait doesn't function until an attuned creature spends 24 hours repairing the artifact or until the artifact is subjected to lightning damage.

Standing Leap. The servant's long jump is up to 50 feet and its high jump is up to 25 feet, with or without a running start.

Unusual Nature. The servant doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### ACTIONS

Destructive Fist. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10) force damage. If the target is an object, it takes triple damage.

Crushing Leap. If the servant jumps at least 25 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures is pushed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the servant and must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 26 (4d12) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible.

Self-Destruct. By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.

If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.

This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts-left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torsodrop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.

Destroying the Servant. The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property.

A TOOTH OI DAHLVER-NAR

### TEETH OF DAHLVER-NAR

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)

The Teeth of Dahlver-Nar are stories given form. They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of wildly different origins and made from various materials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.

Using the Teeth. While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).

If you don't sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).

Each tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth's result is rolled after it's been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.

Sowing Teeth. To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.

Implanting Teeth. To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can't be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the

tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.

Recovering Teeth. Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.

Destroying the Teeth. Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth's story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.

|  |  |  | action, a shimmering image of a unicorn's horn appears until the |
|  |  |  | end of your turn, sprouting from your forehead. The tooth regains |

| 8 | Beyond the Rock of | 2 mind flayers | You gain telepathy out to 120 feet as described in the Monster Man- |

HE DUNGEON MASTER EMPLOYS MANY tools when preparing and running a D&D campaign. As a DM, your tools include your imagination, your ability to discern what entertains your players, your storytelling acumen, your sense of humor, your ability to listen well, your facility with the game's rules, and more. This chapter adds to your toolbox with guidance and optional rules for a variety of situations. The chapter also includes a selection of ready-to-use puzzles, which you can drop into any campaign.

The tools herein build on the material in the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Monster Manual. You may use some, all, or none of these tools, and feel free to customize how they work. Your group's enjoyment is paramount, so make these rules your own, aiming to match your group's tastes.

### SESSION ZERO

Establish boundaries. And if anyone crosses them, speal up. If they don't listen, there's always cloudkill .. TASHA

Before making characters or playing the game, the DM and players can run a special session-colloquially called session zero-to establish expectations, outline the terms of a social contract, and share house rules. Making and sticking to these rules can help ensure that the game is a fun experience for evervone involved.

Often a session zero includes building characters together. As the DM, you can help players during the character creation process by advising them to select options that will serve the adventure or campaign that awaits.

### CHARACTER AND PARTY CREATION

Each player has options when it comes to choosing a character race, class, and background, though you may restrict certain options that are deemed unsuitable for the campaign. If there are multiple players in the group, you should encourage them to choose different classes so that the adventuring party has a range of abilities. It's less important that the party include multiple backgrounds, as sometimes it's fun to play an all-soldier party or a troupe of adventuring entertainers. The backgrounds they choose define who their characters were before becoming

adventurers and also include roleplaying hooks in the form of ideals, bonds, and flaws-things you ought to know. For example, if a player chooses the criminal background, one of the options for the character's bond is, "I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor." If that's the character's bond, you should work with the player to decide who that generous benefactor is and build relevant storylines into the larger campaign.

### PARTY FORMATION

During session zero, your role is to let the players build the characters they want and to help them come up with explanations for how their characters came together to form an adventuring party. It can be helpful to assume that the characters know each other and have some sort of history together, however brief that history might be. Here are some questions you can ask the players as they create characters to get a sense of the party's relationships:

- · Are any of the characters related to each other?
- · What keeps the characters together as a party?
- · What does each character like most about every other member of the adventuring party?
- · Does the group have a patron? See chapter 2, "Group Patrons," for patron examples.

If the players are having trouble coming up with a story for how their characters met, they may choose an option from the Party Origin table or let a d6 roll choose it for them. You should spend part of session zero helping the players flesh out the details. For example, if the characters came together to overcome a common foe, the identity of this enemy needs to be determined. If a funeral gathered the group, the identity of the deceased and each character's relationship to them will need to be fleshed out.

### PARTY ORIGIN

#### de Origin Story

- The characters grew up in the same place and have 1 known each other for years.
- The characters have united to overcome a foe. 2
- The characters were brought together by a common 3 benefactor who wishes to sponsor their adventures.
- A funeral brings the characters together. 4
- 5 A festival brings the characters together.
- The characters find themselves trapped together. 6

### RUNNING A GAME FOR ONE PLAYER

A DM running a game for one player should spend part of session zero working with that player to come up with their character's backstory, then let the player decide if they want the character to have a sidekick (see the "Sidekicks" section in this chapter).

You might need to help the player run the sidekick for the first few sessions and should make sure the player understands the functions and limitations of sidekicks:

- · Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can perform tasks both in and out of combat, including things such as setting up camp and carrying gear.
- · Ideally, a sidekick's abilities should complement those of the main character. For example, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for a fighter or rogue.

### SOCIAL CONTRACT

D&D is first and foremost meant to be a fun-for-all experience. If one or more participants aren't having fun, the game won't last long. Session zero is the perfect time for you and the players to discuss the experience they're hoping for, as well as topics, themes, and behavior they deem inappropriate. Out of this discussion, a social contract begins to form.

Sometimes a social contract takes shape organically, but it's good practice to have a direct conversation during session zero to establish boundaries and expectations. A typical social contract in a D&D group includes implicit or explicit commitments to the following points:

- · You will respect the players by running a game
- that is fun, fair, and tailored for them. You will allow every player to contribute to the ongoing story and give every character moments to shine. When a player is talking, you are listening.
- · The players will respect you and the effort it takes to create a fun game for everyone. The players will allow you to direct the campaign, arbitrate the rules, and settle arguments. When you are talking, the players are listening.
- · The players will respect one another, listen to one another, support one another, and do their utmost to preserve the cohesion of the adventuring party.
- · Should you or a player disrespect each other or violate the social contract in some other way, the group may dismiss that person from the table.

This social contract covers the basics, but individual groups might require additional agreed-upon terms to guarantee a fun play experience for all. And a social contract typically evolves as a group's members learn more about one another.

### HARD AND SOFT LIMITS

Once you and the players have acknowledged the terms of the game's social contract and agreed to uphold them, the conversation can segue into a discussion about soft and hard limits. There are many ways to mediate this discussion, and you might want to do some research to find an approach that might work well for your group. For purposes of this explanation, these terms are described as follows:

- A soft limit is a threshold that one should think twice about crossing, as it is likely to create genuine anxiety, fear, and discomfort.
- A hard limit is a threshold that should never be crossed.

Every member of the group has soft and hard limits, and it behooves everyone in the group to know what they are. Make sure everyone at the table is comfortable with how this discussion takes place. Players might not want to discuss their limits aloud around the table, especially if thev're new to roleplaying games or haven't spent a lot of time with certain other members of the group. One way to alleviate such discomfort is to encourage the players to share their limits privately with you and allow you to present them without attribution to the whole group. For example, the players could write their limits on index cards for you to read aloud. However these limits are presented, it would be useful for you or one of the players to compile the limits into one list that can be shared with the whole group. Keep in mind that any discussion about limits should be treated with care-even sharing a person's limits can be a very painful experience, and this conversation should be handled with respect.

Common in-game limits include-but are not limited to-themes or scenes of sex, exploitation, racial profiling, slavery, violence toward children and animals, gratuitous swearing, and intra-party romance. Common out-of-game limits include unwanted physical contact, dice-sharing, dice-throwing, shouting, vulgarity, rules lawyering, distracting use of cell phones, and generally disrespectful behavior.

The discussion of limits is important because DMs and players can have phobias or triggers that others might not be aware of. Any in-game topic or theme that makes a member of the gaming group feel unsafe or uncomfortable should be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they give you consent to include it in-game, incorporating it should be handled with care, and you must be ready to veer away from such topics and themes quickly.

While session zero is the perfect place to start this discussion, it might not be the only time limits are addressed. Someone might cross a line and need to be reminded of a limit, or someone might not think to include some of their limits in the initial discussion. Players can also discover new limits as the campaign unfolds. Make a plan to check in with the group to make sure the list of hard and soft limits is up to date, and remind everyone to revisit this list often in case it changes.

### GAME CUSTOMIZATION

In addition to shaping the game around the characters in the adventuring party, you should be prepared to customize the game to suit the players' tastes. The "Know Your Players" section in the introduction of the Dungeon Master's Guide provides some guidance for doing so, based on known player archetypes. To help identity what types of players are in the group, you can ask each player any or all of the following questions:

- · Which of the three pillars of adventuring (combat, exploration, roleplaying) interest you the most?
- · How much humor do you like in the game ?
- · What level of technology do you prefer?
- · Do you enjoy solving in-game puzzles and riddles?
- · Do you like to track experience points, or would you rather have your character advance in level when I tell you to?

### HOUSE RULES

House rules include optional rules, such as those presented in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, and rules you create. If you plan to use any house rules, session zero is a good time to discuss those rules with the players and solicit their input.

House rules are best presented as experiments, and time will tell if they're good for your game. If you introduce a house rule in session zero that turns out to have an adverse effect on people's enjoyment of the game, you may jettison or revise the house rule to create a better gaming experience for everyone. Don't feel bad if a house rule doesn't end up working as well as you expected it to. Remember: the goal is to ensure everyone is having fun.

### SIDEKICKS

My soon-to-be sidekick could learn a thing or two fro all this-more material for Project Humblekainen . TASHA

This section provides a straightforward way to add a special NPC-called a sidekick-to the group of adventurers. These rules take a creature with a low challenge rating and give it levels in one of three simple classes: Expert, Spellcaster, or Warrior.

A sidekick can be incorporated into a group at the party's inception, or a sidekick might join them during the campaign. For example, the characters might meet a villager, an animal, or another creature, forge a friendship, and invite the creature to join them on their adventures.

You can also use these rules to customize a monster for your own use as DM.

### CREATING A SIDEKICK

A sidekick can be any type of creature with a stat block in the Monster Manual or another D&D book, but the challenge rating in its stat block must be 1/2 or lower. You take that stat block and add to it, as explained in the "Gaining a Sidekick Class" section.

To join the adventurers, the sidekick must be the friend of at least one of them. This friendship might be connected to a character's backstory or to events that have transpired in play. For example, a sidekick could be a childhood friend or pet, or it might be a creature the adventurers saved. As DM, you determine whether there is sufficient trust established for the creature to join the group.

You decide who plays the sidekick. Here are some options:

- · A player plays the sidekick as their second character-ideal when you have only one or two players.
- · A player plays the sidekick as their only character-ideal for a player who wants a character who's simpler than a typical player character.
- · The players jointly play the sidekick.
- · You play the sidekick.

There's no limit on the number of sidekicks in a group, but having more than one per player character can noticeably slow down the game. And when estimating the difficulty of an upcoming encounter, count each sidekick as a character.

### GAINING A SIDEKICK CLASS

When you create a sidekick, you choose the class it will have for the rest of its career: Expert, Spellcaster, or Warrior, each of which is detailed below. If a sidekick class contains a choice, you may make the choice or let the players make it.

### STARTING LEVEL

The starting level of a sidekick is the same as the average level of the group. For example, if a 1st-level group starts out with a sidekick, that sidekick is also 1st level, but if a 10th-level group invites a sidekick to join them, that sidekick starts at 10th level.

### LEVELING UP A SIDEKICK

Whenever a group's average level goes up, the sidekick gains a level. It doesn't matter how much of the group's recent adventures the sidekick experienced; the sidekick levels up because of a combination of the adventures it shared with the group and its own training.

### HIT POINTS

Whenever the sidekick gains a level, it gains one Hit Die, and its hit point maximum increases. To determine the amount of the increase, roll the Hit Die (the type of die appears in the sidekick's stat block), and add its Constitution modifier. It gains a minimum of 1 hit point per level.

If the sidekick drops to 0 hit points and isn't killed outright, it falls unconscious and subsequently makes death saving throws, just like a player character.

### PROFICIENCY BONUS

The sidekick's proficiency bonus is determined by its level in its class, as shown in the class's table.

Whenever the sidekick's proficiency bonus increases by 1, add 1 to the to-hit modifier of all the attacks in its stat block, and increase the DCs in its stat block by 1.

### ABILITY SCORE INCREASES

Whenever the sidekick gains the Ability Score Improvement feature, adjust anything in its stat block that relies on an ability modifier that you increase. For example, if the sidekick has an attack that uses its Strength modifier, increase the attack's modifiers to hit and damage if the Strength modifier increases.

If it's unclear whether a melee attack in the stat block uses Strength or Dexterity, the attack can use either.

### EXPERT

The Expert is a master of certain tasks or knowledge, favoring cunning over brawn. It might be a scout, a musician, a librarian, a clever street kid, a wily merchant, or a burglar.

To gain the Expert class, a creature must have at least one language in its stat block that it can speak.

A sidekick gains the following class features as it gains levels, as summarized on the Expert table.

EXPERTS, LEFT TO RIGHT: A TORTLE, A WINGED KOBOLD, AND A KENKU

### BONUS PROFICIENCIES

### 1st-level Expert feature

The sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw of your choice: Dexterity, Intelligence, or Charisma.

In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in five skills of your choice, and it gains proficiency with light armor. If it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial weapon in its stat block, it also gains proficiency with all simple weapons and with two tools of your choice.

### HELPFUL

### 1st-level Expert feature

The sidekick is adept at giving well-timed assistance; the sidekick can take the Help action as a bonus action.

### CUNNING ACTION

### EXPERTISE

### 3rd-level Expert feature

Choose two of the sidekick's skill proficiencies. The sidekick's proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check it makes that uses any of the chosen proficiencies.

| 19th | +6 | Ability Score Improvement |
| 20th | +6 | Inspiring Help (2d6) |

At 15th level, choose two more of the sidekick's skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

### ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

### 4th-level Expert feature

At 4th level and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### COORDINATED STRIKE

6th-level Expert feature

The sidekick is adept at fighting in concert with a companion. When the sidekick uses its Helpful feature to aid an ally in attacking a creature, that target can be up to 30 feet away from the sidekick, and the sidekick can deal an extra 2d6 damage to it the next time the sidekick hits it with an attack roll before the end of the current turn. The extra damage is the same type of damage dealt by the attack.

### EVASION

### 7th-level Expert feature

Because of extraordinary good luck, the sidekick is skilled at avoiding danger. When the sidekick is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it failed. The sidekick doesn't benefit from this feature while incapacitated.

### INSPIRING HELP

### 11th-level Expert feature

When the sidekick takes the Help action, the creature who receives the help also gains a 1d6 bonus to the d20 roll. If that roll is an attack roll, the creature can forgo adding the bonus to it, and then if the attack hits, the creature can add the bonus to the attack's damage roll against one target.

At 20th level, the bonus increases to 2d6.

### RELIABLE TALENT

### 14th-level Expert feature

The sidekick has refined its skills to an exceptional degree. Whenever the sidekick makes an ability check that includes its whole proficiency bonus, it can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### SHARP MIND

### 18th-level Expert feature

The sidekick gains proficiency in one of the following saving throws of your choice: Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

### SPELLCASTER

A sidekick who becomes a Spellcaster walks the paths of magic. The sidekick might be a hedge wizard, a priest, a soothsayer, a magical performer, or a person with magic in their veins.

To gain the Spellcaster class, a creature must have at least one language in its stat block that it can speak.

A sidekick gains the following class features as it gains levels in this class, as summarized on the Spellcaster table.

### BONUS PROFICIENCIES

### 1st-level Spellcaster feature

The sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw of your choice: Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma.

In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in two skills of your choice from the following list: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Performance, Persuasion, and Religion.

The sidekick gains proficiency with light armor, and if it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial weapon in its stat block, it also gains proficiency with all simple weapons.

#### SPELLCASTING

### 1st-level Spellcaster feature

The sidekick gains the ability to cast spells. (If the creature already has the Spellcasting trait, this feature replaces that trait.) Choose the Spellcaster's role: Mage, Healer, or Prodigy. This choice determines the spell list and spellcasting ability used by the sidekick, as shown on the Spellcasting table.

### SPELLCASTING

| Role | Spell List | Ability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mage | Wizard | Intelligence |
| Healer | Cleric and Druid | Wisdom |
| Prodigy | Bard and Warlock | Charisma |

Spell Slots. The Spellcaster table shows how many spell slots the sidekick has to cast its Spellcaster spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, the sidekick must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. The sidekick regains all expended spell slots when it finishes a long rest.

. Spells Known. The sidekick knows two cantrips and one 1st-level spell of your choice from its spell list. Here are recommendations for a 1st-level spellcaster of each role:

Mage: mage hand, ray of frost, thunderwave Healer: cure wounds, guidance, sacred flame Prodigy: eldritch blast, healing word, light

learns more spells of your choice. Each of the spells in the Spells Known column must be of a level for which the sidekick has spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when the sidekick reaches 5th level in this class, it can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when the sidekick gains a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells it knows from this class and replace it with another spell from its spell list. The new spell must be a cantrip or of a level for which the sidekick has spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. The sidekick's spellcasting ability for these spells depends on the choice you made on the Spellcasting table.

The sidekick uses its spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to that ability. In addition, it uses its spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell it casts and when making an attack roll with one.

> Spell save DC = 8 + sidekick's proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier Spell attack modifier = sidekick's proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier

Spellcasting Focus. The sidekick can use a focus for its spells depending on the choice you made on the Spellcasting table. A Mage can use an arcane focus, a Priest can use a holy symbol, and a Prodigy can use an arcane focus or a musical instrument.

### ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

### 6th-level Spellcaster feature

The sidekick can add its spellcasting ability modifier to the damage it deals with any cantrip.

### EMPOWERED SPELLS

### FOCUSED CASTING

### 20th-level Spellcaster feature

Taking damage can't break the sidekick's concentration on a spell.

### WARRIOR

A Warrior sidekick grows in martial prowess as it fights by your side. It might be a soldier, a town guard, a battle-trained beast, or any other creature honed for combat.

A sidekick gains the following class features as it gains levels in this class, as summarized on the Warrior table.

### PARLEYING WITH MONSTERS

Why fight if a lively chat is possible ? If things get out of hand, just show yourself out with a dimension door . TASHA

Meeting a monster doesn't have to spark a fight. An offering, like food, can calm some hostile monsters, and sapient creatures often prefer to talk than to draw weapons. If the adventurers try to parley with a monster, you may improvise the encounter or use the social interaction rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Consider granting the characters advantage on any ability check they make to communicate with a creature if they offer something it wants. The "Monsters' Desires" section below suggest things that a creature might like, depending on its type.

### MONSTER RESEARCH

Adventurers can research what a creature is likely to desire. The Monster Research table suggests which skills can be used to learn about a creature of a particular type. The DC for a relevant ability check equals 10 + the creature's challenge rating.

### MONSTER RESEARCH

| Type | Suggested Skills |
| --- | --- |
| Aberration | Arcana |
| Beast | Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival |
| Celestial | Arcana or Religion |
| Construct | Arcana |

ITASHA

This section explores how to add fantastical challenges to any locale and ways to further bring an adventure's setting to life.

When a creature's name appears in bold in a table herein, that indicates that you can find the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual.

### SUPERNATURAL REGIONS

Not all lands thrive as nature intended. Magical forces, strange interlopers, or tragic events can alter an area's destiny, fundamentally changing the land. While the flora, fauna, structures, and inhabitants might remain unaffected, the land's innate character takes on new qualities.

A supernatural region is permeated by a preternatural force in an area as large or small as you wish. In the affected area, certain effects and brief encounters reinforce an underlying theme. These effects occur as characters traverse an influenced region or add interest to a specific affected location.

The descriptions of the following supernatural regions summarize the region, present a table of potential effects within the affected area, and note triggers for a random effect. Feel free to customize the effects of each region to suit any adventure.

The effects of a region occur whenever you please, at the time each description suggests, or under one or more of the following circumstances:

- · Soon after the party first enters the region
- · When a creature loses more than half its hit points
- · When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher
- · When a creature activates a magic item
- . When a creature makes an exceptionally loud noise or otherwise attracts attention
- · When the party spends at least 30 minutes in the same region

### BLESSED RADIANCE

The grace of the Upper Planes touches this region. Consider rolling on the Blessed Radiance Effects table when the following circumstances occur in the region:

- · A creature succeeds on a saving throw compelled by the abilities of a fiend or an undead.
- A creature is the target of a cleric or paladin spell of 3rd level or higher
- · A creature scores a critical hit against a fiend or an undead
- · A creature experiences an epiphany or inspiring triumph in the service of righteousness or in defiance of wickedness

### BLESSED RADIANCE EFFECTS

#### Effect d100

- 01-06 Golden light fills a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on one character in the region and then fades. That character and their friends in the cylinder gain the benefits of the divine favor spell for 1 hour.
- Radiant energy erupts in a 10-foot-radius 07-12 sphere centered on one random creature in the region. Each creature in the sphere that isn't undead regains 3d6 hit points. Each undead creature in the sphere takes 3d6 radiant damage.
- 13-18 Aberrations, fiends, and undead in the region have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for the next 24 hours.
- 19-24 Each creature carrying the holy symbol of a deity from a non-evil plane while in the region gains advantage on saving throws for the next 24 hours.
- 25-30 One character in the region is suffused with celestial power. For 1 minute, the character's melee attacks deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage on a hit.
- 31-36 One simple or martial weapon that is nonmagical and carried by one character in the region gains the properties of a mace of disruption for 24 hours.
- 37-42 A flying, gleaming sword (use the flying sword stat block in the Monster Manual) appears within 60 feet of an aberration, a fiend, or an undead, which becomes the sword's target. The sword deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage and knows the exact location of its target while the target is within the region. The sword vanishes when it or its target is reduced to 0 hit points.
- One character in the region hears whispers 43-48 from celestial beings or refrains of celestial choirs. The character can ask those voices one question as if using the commune spell.

#### A BLESSED KI-RIN SHRINE

#### d100 Effect

- 49-54 Aberrations, fiends, and undead in the region give off a crimson glow for 1 minute. The creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius, attacks against them have advantage if the attacker can see them, and the creatures can't benefit from being invisible.
- 55-60 Celestial power explodes in a 30-foot-radius sphere of divine light centered on an aberration, a fiend, or an undead creature within the region. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 radiant damage and is blinded. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't blinded.
- 61-66 One character in the region feels a profound sense of purpose and gains the benefit of the bless spell for 1 minute. They can choose two other creatures they can see to gain the spell's benefits as well.
- 67-72 A booming voice thunders in Celestial and can be heard throughout the region. Each creature in the region must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature gains 2d10 temporary hit points. On a failure, the creature is deafened for 1 minute.

#### d100 Effect

| 73-78 | One character in the region gains the ability to |
| --- | --- |
|  | cure afflictions for 1 hour. As an action, they |
|  | can cast lesser restoration or greater restoration |
|  | without expending a spell slot and requiring no |
|  | material components. |
| 79-84 | The effects of a hallow spell (save DC 17), with |
|  | one of its extra effects (DM's choice), settle |
|  | over the region for 24 hours. |
| 85-90 | An angelic voice rings throughout the region. |
|  | Each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 |
|  | Wisdom saving throw or perform the grovel |
|  | option of the command spell. |
| 91-95 | One character in the region permanently gains |

- resistance to necrotic damage. Reroll if you've already rolled this effect.
- 96-00 One character in the region gains the ability to use the Divine Intervention cleric feature, which succeeds automatically. The character can use the feature granted in this way only once and must use it within 7 days. Reroll if you've already rolled this effect.

### FAR REALM

As souls travel away from the Material Plane after death, they either dwell in the Astral Plane as spirits or are pulled toward one of the Outer Planes to continue their journey. But some entities find ways to travel bevond the Outer Planes to dwell in the Far Realm. There they transform over eons into abominations or elder evils, seething in a reality with its own laws. All who stay in the Far Realm are eventually twisted into alien shapes by the realm's eldritch forces.

The Far Realm's pernicious influence is often subtle, leaking into the Material Plane through thin places in reality or as invasive thoughts that inspire life to propagate along alien paths.

Consider rolling on the Far Realm Effects table when the following circumstances occur in a region touched by the Far Realm:

- · A warlock whose Otherworldly Patron is a Great Old One rolls a 1 or 20 on the d20 for an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw.
- · The characters take a short or long rest in the region.
- · A creature spends more than an hour reading an eldritch tome written by those who have seen or otherwise interacted with the Far Realm.

### FAR REALM EFFECTS

#### d100 Effect

- 01-09 A structure in the region whispers faintly. Any creature within 60 feet of the structure that can hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed. While charmed in this way, the creature must move toward the source of the whispering, avoiding obvious hazards. When it reaches the source, it is incapacitated. The creature can repeat the saving throw when it takes damage and at the end of every hour, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- 10-18 An elder evil turns its attention to the region, imposing the pressure of its unfathomable presence upon the place. Any creature that finishes a rest in the region must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw, or it gains no benefit from finishing the rest. It instead finds strange scrawls, stacked stones, or its belongings arranged in intricate, abstruse patterns nearby.

#### d100 Effect

- 19-27 Local plants and animals share a malevolent intelligence. Roll a d6. On a 1-2, an insect plague spell is centered on one random creature in the region. On a 3-4, 1d4 swarms of ravens and 1d4 swarms ofrats gather and attack any other creatures in the region. On a 5-6, a treant (in forested terrain) or a galeb duhr (in rockier terrain) attacks.
- 28-36 Distance no longer functions in a comprehensible manner within the region. Creatures make ranged attack rolls with disadvantage, and the range of those attacks is halved.
- The landscape melts into a mass of writhing 37-45 flesh, eyes, and fanged mouths. From an unoccupied space in the fleshy ground arise 1d4 + 5 gibbering mouthers that attack anyone in sight.
- 46-54 Unintelligible murmurings threaten to overcome the mind of one random creature within the region. At the start of the creature's turn. it must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or use its action to make one melee attack against the nearest creature it can see. If there are no other creatures within reach, the target spends its action babbling.
- 55-63 Bizarre appendages squirm beneath the ground and around trees or other structures within this region. Dozens of limbs burst forth, entangling anyone within a 30-foot sphere surrounding one random creature. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained. Any creature that ends its turn in the area takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature can free itself or someone else within reach from being restrained in this way by using an action to make a successful DC 14 Strength or Dexterity check (its choice).

64-72 Creatures in the region can't leave it and find themselves covering the same ground over and over. By the time they realize this, 2d10 hours

have passed, during which they have made no progress in their effort to leave. The effect then ends, and each creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion.

A FAR REALM INCURSION WITH MIND FLAYER NAUTILOIDS

#### d100 Effect

- 73-79 One random creature in the region hears strange whispers and must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed. While charmed in this way, the creature focuses on copying the blasphemous designs that appear in its mind using whatever medium it has available (ink, charcoal, mud, or its own blood). Unless restrained, the creature completes the designs in 1 hour of work. When the creature finishes its work, it is no longer charmed, and a death slaad appears within 30 feet of it and attacks anyone in sight.
- 80-85

Natural features and structures in this region writhe to spell out words and form strange symbols. Any creature that tries to read the messages must make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the creature gains insight as if it had cast the contact other plane spell. On a failure, the creature is affected as if it failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. This effect ends at the end of the creature's next turn.

#### d100 Effect

|  | 86-90 In this region, circular things (such as buttons, |
| --- | --- |
|  | crystal balls, the sun, and so on) seem appall- |
|  | ingly wrong. One random creature that starts |
|  | its turn in this region must succeed on a DC 14 |
|  | Intelligence saving throw or spend their turn |
|  | loudly trying to destroy these objects. |
| 91-95 | Glaring eyes, which weep viscid tears, appear |
|  | on inanimate objects throughout the region. |
|  | These eyes watch the characters, and creatures |
|  | within the region can't be surprised by the |
|  | characters for as long as the eyes exist. An eye |
|  | closes and disappears if it takes any damage. |
|  | Reroll if you've already rolled this effect. |
| 96-00 | A tear in reality creates a rift in the region, simi- |
|  | lar to the spell gate, that passes through the Far |
|  | Realm and connects with a random plane. Any |
|  | creature that enters the rift takes 10d10 psychic |
|  | damage from the horrors of the Far Realm and |
|  | appears in an empty space closest to the rift's |

opening on another random plane. The rift

vanishes after 2d10 + 2 hours.

TUS LUNTE

### HAUNTED

Haunted environs include homes burdened by dark deeds, the sites of mass killings, and locations where individuals died while experiencing powerful fear, sorrow, or hatred. Haunted places bear echoes of the past and, like ghosts, harass visitors even as they seek respite from age-old traumas. Few places are meaninglessly haunted, and you can easily customize the general results on the following table to suit all manner of macabre tales.

Consider rolling on the Haunted Effects table when the following circumstances occur in the region:

- · A creature gains the frightened condition.
- · Multiple creatures are unable to see.
- · A creature is alone.
- · Midnight or another ominous hour arrives.
- · A ghost or other creature tied to the region's grim history menaces the party.

### HAUNTED EFFECTS

#### d100 Effect

| 01-05 A violent thunderstorm begins, centered over |  |
| --- | --- |
| the region. It doesn't end until the party leaves |  |
| the region. |  |
| 06-10 | A random building in the region gains the ben- |
| efits of the guards and wards spell (save DC 13) |  |
| for the next 24 hours. |  |
| 11-15 | A mundane part of one random character's |
| surroundings-perhaps a tree bole or a taxi- |  |
| dermied animal head-animates for 1 minute |  |
| and whispers a warning or threatens to reveal |  |

- one of the character's secrets. 16-20 All bright light weakens to dim light for 24 hours. Sources that provide dim light, such as candles, do not shed any light.
- 21-25 The temperature in the region drops by 10 degrees Fahrenheit every hour for the next 1d6 hours, after which the temperature returns to normal. If cold enough, ice crystals form in sinister patterns.
- 26-30 One random creature's shadow acts independently for the next 24 hours. The shadow acts out of sync with its owner, perhaps dramatically choking or trying to murder another shadow.

#### d100 Effect

- 31-35 After the next sunset. the sun doesn't rise again for 36 hours. During this time, the sky over the region might hold a crimson moon, be obscured by roiling fog, or display blinking, alien stars.
- 36-40 During the next night, one random sleeping creature vanishes and reappears approximately a foot beneath where they were sleeping-typically buried in undisturbed dirt or in a space beneath floorboards. The creature or someone else can free it with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check.
- 41-45 One random creature in the region is targeted by the levitate spell (save DC 15) for 1 minute.
- A nonviolent but unsettling ghost-perhaps a 46-50 pet, an accident-prone child, or a dismembered big toe-appears and follows one random creature for 24 hours before vanishing. The ghost vanishes if reduced to 0 hit points.
- 51-55 One player character's appearance changes for the next 24 hours to reflect the region's haunted history. For example, they might manifest the distinctive facial scar associated with a notorious tyrant who died in the region.
- For the next 24 hours, any humanoid killed in 56-60 the region rapidly decomposes and rises as a skeleton 1d10 minutes after dying.
- 61-65 Over the next 24 hours, whenever any creature is wounded, its blood (or similar fluid) spreads to form a short message or grisly tableau.
- 66-70 A spirit inhabits one character's simple or martial weapon, making it a sentient magic item until the character leaves the region. Randomly generate the item's properties as described in the "Sentient Magic Items" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
- A spectral force manifests to one character in 71-75 the region, allowing them to ask one question and receive a short answer as through the augury spell. The force manifests as a planchette moving on a talking board, writing on foggy glass, or insects swarming to create messages.
- During the next night, one sleeping character 76-80 in the region receives a vision as if the target of the dream spell. The dream is brief and unsettling, revealing some element of the environment's history and putting the character in the place of someone who suffered a grim fate there.

A HAUNTED MANOR

#### d100 Effect

- A coffin or small enclosed space in the re-81-85 gion-perhaps an antique box, stone cairn, or tree stump sealed with rocks-radiates palpable malice. The first time a creature opens it, roll a die. If you roll an even number, the creature receives a terrible vision and is frightened of all creatures for the next 24 hours. If you roll an odd number, an avatar of death appears and attacks as though summoned by the Skull card from a deck of many things.
86-90

Over the next 24 hours, whenever any creature in the region regains hit points from a spell, the healing magic leaves scars. This might be accompanied by a purging of black bile or a spectral force tearing free from the creature. These scars can be removed only by greater restoration or wish.

#### d100 Effect

- 91-95 For 24 hours, a luminous wisp of vapor floats above a corpse or grave in the region. If the wisp is put in a container, a creature holding the receptacle can cast the resurrection spell once, requiring no components and causing the wisp to vanish. Any creature returned to life in this way experiences strange dreams.
96-00 A mysterious mist rises from the shadows. This dense fog heavily obscures everything in a 50-foot-radius sphere around one random creature in the region. Any creature that starts its turn in the mist must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. This exhaustion can't be removed while the creature is in the mist. Additionally, creatures notice unsettling sights through the fog, such as ominous ruins or soundless silhouettes fleeing pursuit. The mists can't be dispersed by any wind, but clear after 1 minute.

### INFESTED

On many worlds, the biomass of insects radically outweighs that of higher organisms. Mass migrations and deadly insect species can imperil larger creatures, but most insects remain nothing more than an annovance. However, through wild population booms, magical manipulation, supernatural growth, interbreeding with otherworldly species, or stranger circumstances, insects can overrun an entire region. Swarms of insects become the dominant species in an area, consuming plants and animals, creating elaborate hives or tunnels, and infesting structures and the earth.

The following effects represent a region overrun by insects or hives of similar creatures, likely manipulated by magic, otherworldly intelligence, or environmental factors to infest an area in countless numbers and drive out all competing life.

Consider rolling on the Infested Effects table when the following circumstances occur in the region:

- · Webs, cocoons, hives, anthills, or other insect dwellings are disturbed.
- · A creature attacks an insect swarm or a Small or larger insect, such as a giant centipede or giant spider, in the region.
- · A creature begins a short or long rest.

### INFESTED EFFECTS

#### d100 Infested Effects 01-05 Intense buzzing or grinding noises fill the region for the next 24 hours. With the exception of truly cacophonous sounds, creatures can only hear speech and noises that originate within 10 feet of them. 06-10 A mass migration of insects begins, with waves

- of Tiny bugs crawling over everything in the region. Creatures cannot take a short or long rest in the region for the next 24 hours.
- 11-15 A swarm of bioluminescent flies converges on one random creature in the region. For the next minute, the creature sheds dim light in a 10foot radius, any attack against it has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the creature can't benefit from being invisible.
- 16-20 A boil of termites bursts from the ground, along with dozens of bones and a treasure of the DM's choice (see "Random Treasure" in the Dungeon Master's Guide).

#### d100 Infested Effects

- 21-25 A cricket-shaped creature with the statistics of a cat bounds up to one random creature and follows it like an affectionate pet for 24 hours before scampering off.
- 26-30 A cluster of 1d4 + 2 faintly glowing grubs appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the party. Any creature that consumes one of these succulent grubs receives the benefits of a potion of healing.
- 31-35 A large, psychedelically colored moth flies over the party, dusting the characters with strange powder. Creatures the moth flies over must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be charmed by all creatures for 1 hour.
- The region is choked with wispy webbing, 36-45 which acts as difficult terrain.
- 46-50 Nearly every surface is covered with discarded cicadae-like shells that crunch loudly when trod upon, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while moving across them. The shells vanish after 1 hour.
- 51-55 A massive, bloated maggot emerges from the ground within 10 feet of the party and bursts, covering the ground with ichor in a 10-foot square centered on it. This region is affected by the grease spell (save DC 13) for 1 minute.
- The ground opens up beneath one random 56-60 creature, creating a quicksand pit (see the Dungeon Master's Guide).
- 61-65 One random creature in the region must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or contract the sight rot disease (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) from minute parasites.
- Dung-colored bugs cover the ground. Crea-66-70 tures that move at half their normal walking speed can ignore the bugs. Those that move faster must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of their next turn. A creature poisoned in this way has its speed reduced to 0, as it is overcome by the squashed insects' foul smell. Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw.
- One of the characters in the region must suc-71-75 ceed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be transformed into a giant spider, as if by the polymorph spell. The spell lasts for 1 hour or until dispelled.

#### d100 Infested Effects

- 76-80 One random creature in the region must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, or it acquires a ravenous silverfish infestation among its gear. The infestation is discovered the next time the creature finishes a short or long rest. If the creature has any paper material, the silverfish destroy one random book or other paper item that isn't magical.
- 81-85 One random creature in the region must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become host to a particularly aggressive tapeworm. The affected creature gains no benefit from eating until it receives treatment that removes a disease. A creature immune to disease automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

### Infested Effects d100 86-90 Biting mites infest creatures' clothing in the region. Any creature wearing medium or heavy armor has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next 24 hours. 91-95 Tiny arachnids invade unattended spaces. The next time one random creature in the region dons its clothing or armor after finishing a long rest, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison damage. 96-00 Countless tiny, bloodsucking insects infest the region for the next 1d6 hours. Every hour, each creature in the region must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. The insects don't affect creatures that are immune to disease.

### MIRROR ZONE

A mirror zone occurs where planar and magical energies converge and create a place of reflections. Creatures, objects, and energy reflect, refract, duplicate, or are transported elsewhere. Such locations arise from the intrusion of a theorized Plane of Mirrors upon the Material Plane, or where powerful magic governing transition, protection, or divination had unexpected results.

Consider rolling on the Mirror Zone Effects table when the following circumstances occur in the region:

- · A creature shatters a mirror.
- · A creature uses any teleportation magic.
- · An illusion appears.
- · A creature impersonates another creature.

### MIRROR ZONE EFFECTS

#### d100 Effect

- 01-06 Creatures in the region begin to display features other than their own for the next 24 hours. During that time, affected creatures have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks and ability checks made to disguise themselves.
- The hallucinatory terrain spell (save DC 15) af-07-12 fects the natural terrain of the region, changing it into a different kind of terrain (DM's choice).
- 13-18 One random creature in the region gains the benefits of the blink spell for 1 minute, shimmering with overlapping shattered reflections.
- 19-24 Creatures in the region don't cast reflections. Wisdom (Insight) checks made against those creatures have disadvantage, and the creatures have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made against anyone who notices their lack of reflection. When they leave the region, creatures regain their reflections, and the effect ends.
- 25-34 Reflections of 1d4 creatures in the region emerge from mirrors and attack. The reflections are two-dimensional, shimmering versions of the creatures that cast them. Treat the reflections as shadows that are fey instead of undead and vulnerable to bludgeoning damage instead of radiant.
- 35-40 One character in the region gains the benefit of the mirror image spell. The images created sometimes move or speak of their own volition.

#### d100 Effect

- 41-46
For the next 24 hours, certain wounds caused in the region attract spectral slivers of glass that cause extra damage. Any creature, other than a construct or an undead, hit by an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage begins to bleed, losing 1d4 hit points at the start of each of its turns. If the bleeding creature is hit by another such attack, the bleeding increases by 1d4. Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The bleeding also stops if the target receives magical healing.

- 47-52 Mirrors and other highly reflective surfaces allow magical transport while in the region. Any creature that touches its reflection in an object that it isn't wearing or carrying can immediately cast the misty step spell, requiring no components.
- One character can cast the scrying spell (save 53-58 DC 17) once within the next 24 hours, requiring no components but using a mirror or other reflective surface.
- 59-64 The skin of one random creature in the region becomes silvery and reflective for the next 24 hours. For the duration, that creature has advantage on saving throws against spells, and spell attacks have disadvantage against that creature.
- 65-70 A longsword or shortsword with a blade made of a jagged mirror appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of a random creature in the region. The weapon is a sword of wounding (see the Dungeon Master's Guide). If the weapon's wielder rolls a 1 or 20 on an attack roll using the weapon, the weapon shatters and is destroyed after that attack.
- 71-76 For the next 24 hours, when anyone in the region hits a creature with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take force damage equal to half the damage dealt.

A TAILOR SHOP IN A MIRROR ZONE

#### d100 Effect

- 77-82 Two shimmering, vertical, reflective disks of energy appear in unoccupied spaces in the region for 1 minute. Each is 6 feet in diameter and floats 1 foot above the ground. One appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the party. Any creature that moves through the disk instantly appears within 5 feet of the other disk or the nearest unoccupied space.
- 83-88 The next time one character in the party sees their reflection in the region, that reflection of comes to life and engages its counterpart in conversation. It offers to answer one question posed to it as if the creature cast the divination spell. After answering the question, the reflection returns to normal.

#### d100 Effect

89-94 Floating shards of broken mirrors swirl through the region, showing reflections of creatures and places that aren't present, for the next minute before vanishing. On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), the shards make a ranged weapon attack (+6 to hit) against one random creature in the region. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage.

95-00

A duplicate of one random creature in the region appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of that creature. The duplicate's appearance, game statistics, and equipment are identical to the creature's. The duplicate immediately attacks the creature, seeking to slay it. If the duplicate dies, it and all its equipment shatter into mirror shards. If the duplicate fails to slay the creature within 1 hour, the duplicate vanishes.

ANIMALS CONVERSE AFTER GAINING SAPIENCE FROM AMBIENT PSYCHIC ENERGY.

### PSYCHIC RESONANCE

In an area of psychic resonance, magic imposes strange effects on creatures and objects. These manifestations stem from strong emotions combined with magic use or from the presence of psionic creatures.

Consider rolling on the Psychic Resonance Effects table when the following circumstances occur in the region:

- · A creature endures a powerful emotional experience.

| the flung objects. |

- 19-24 Memories become sharp and clear for 1 hour. During this time, each creature in the region adds double its proficiency bonus to Intelligence checks made to recall information.
- Headaches and nosebleeds plague humanoids 25-34 in the region, imposing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks for 1 hour.
- 35-40 Psychic power builds in the mind of one random creature in the region. Once within the next minute, the creature can use a bonus action to magically assault the mind of another creature it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage.
- 41-46 Lurking fears become nightmares. Any creature that finishes a short or long rest in the region must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit for finishing the rest.

- 95-00 The mind of every beast in the region is flooded with psychic energy. This energy causes each beast's Intelligence score to become 10, if it wasn't already higher, and the beast gains the ability to speak Common and Sylvan fluently. These changes are permanent.

#### AWAKEN ANYTHING

Legends are filled with natural forces and mundane objects that take on humanoid characteristics to guide or confound heroes: statues that sing, animals that whisper secrets, clouds that speak their mind. While monsters like elementals, galeb duhr, and treants represent natural forces brought to life, not every chatty rock or sagacious stream needs a stat block. Perhaps your adventures take a party to a land where plants speak freely or a cursed realm where petrified souls beg for help. Don't feel restricted by the options in the Monster Manual or by the limitations of the animate object spell should you want to breathe extra life into your story. Filling a witch's redoubt with murmuring relics, a fey forest with eavesdropping vegetation, or a sky god's temple with avian choirs makes a place especially memorable. Spells such as animate object, awaken, speak with animals, speak with plants, and the like provide guidance on how to bring commonplace creatures and objects to life.

### UNRAVELING MAGIC

The source of magic is damaged or corrupted in this region. Magic is unpredictable, and strange results occur when a creature casts a spell. Such regions come into being when potent rituals go awry (or if they succeed, in the case of dangerous and destructive undertakings), in the aftermath of cataclysmic magical battles, or where an artifact was destroyed.

Consider rolling on the Unraveling Magic Effects table when the following circumstances occur in the region:

- · Any charges are expended in a magic item.
- · A spell slot of 1st level or higher is expended.
- · A dragon, a fey, or an elemental of challenge rating 5 or higher dies.

### UNRAVELING MAGIC EFFECTS

### d100 Effect 01-05 All magic items in the region temporarily lose their magical properties, becoming nonmagical for 1 hour. Artifacts are unaffected. When the items regain their magic, a creature's attunement to any of them is restored. 06-10 The region becomes a dead-magic zone for 1 hour. For the duration, the entire region is affected by the antimagic field spell. 11-15 One random creature in the region must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be enclosed in Otiluke's resilient sphere for 1 minute. One random creature in the region that has ex-16-20 pended spell slots regains one expended spell

| 86-90 | One random creature in the region breaks |

|  | without effect. The spell slot, charge, or feature |
|  | use that powered the spell is wasted. |

- 91-95 During the next 24 hours, the first time a creature in the region targets another creature with a spell, the caster must make a DC 11 saving throw using its spellcasting ability. On a failed save, the spell targets the caster instead. On a successful save, the spell functions normally. This effect then ends.
- 96-00 One random creature in the region can suddenly cast the wish spell once, within the next minute. Reroll if you've rolled this effect in the past 24 hours.

### MAGICAL PHENOMENA

Magic has the ability to make even the most serene natural settings unpredictable. Whether the result of magical calamities, otherworldly influences, or nexuses of inexplicable forces, the subsequent effects range from whimsical to deadly.

### ELDRITCH STORMS

When magical currents become trapped amid winds and clouds, eldritch storms can result.

Flaywind. Supernaturally powerful windslike those from planes such as Pandemonium or Minethys, the third layer of Carceri-can spawn flaywinds. A flaywind is an intense sandstorm, gathering large rocks and other debris in addition to sand or grit. The area within the storm is heavily obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes 1d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection against the flensing grit.

A flaywind leaves 4d6 feet of sand or debris in its wake. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or (Nature) check or Wisdom (Survival) check allows a character to recognize a flaywind 1 minute before it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter. A flaywind typically lasts 1d4 × 10 hours.

Flame Storm. Sooty thunderclouds shot through with red and orange lightning release a deluge of fiery droplets. Any creature caught in the burning rain takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The droplets ignite any flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried; otherwise, the droplets burn out immediately. The smoke, soot, crackle, and low roar of the storm impose disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and ranged attack rolls.

A flame storm usually lasts 2d4 minutes, though the originating storm clouds can persist for days, creating multiple flame storms.

Necrotic Tempest. Storms infused with the essence of death roil with dark clouds that manifest leering skulls and bone-white lightning. Any creature exposed to the storm that isn't a construct or an undead must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each minute or take 3d6 necrotic damage.

A creature that dies in a necrotic tempest rises as a skeleton or zombie (your choice) 1d10 minutes later.

A necrotic tempest lasts for 1d4 hours and leaves crops withered and wells undrinkable for 1d4 days after its passing.

Thrym's Howl. These bone-chilling blizzards drive a wall of wind and snow like a living glacier. The storm projects extreme cold (see the Dungeon Master's Guide). Due to the howling wind and dense blue-white ice particles, the area in the storm

ELDRITCH STORM

is heavily obscured, and ranged attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks made within it have disadvantage.

Any creature exposed to the storm at the start of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage and can't regain hit points until it spends at least 1 hour in a warm environment. A creature that dies in the storm freezes solid. Creatures that are immune to cold damage are immune to the effects of the storm and can see normally within it.

Thrym's howl typically lasts 2d10 hours.

### EMOTIONAL ECHOES

Occasionally a place becomes infused with the powerful emotions of those who once dwelt, worked, celebrated, or suffered there. Areas with emotional echoes are typically associated with one common emotion, such as joy or sorrow. Such an area might be as small as a room in a house or as large as a forest. Once per day, if a creature within the area expresses even the faintest hint of the prevailing emotion, the land seeks to hold onto that creature and inspire it to produce more of the feeling tied to the emotional echo. The creature is targeted by a suggestion spell (DC 16), with the intent of making it linger in the area and perform an act related to its associated emotion. The effect lasts 24 hours.

The following list notes some of the most common emotional echoes, where they tend to appear, and how they typically influence creatures:

- Boldness: Appears in battlefields and echoing canyons, encouraging creatures to shout hidden truths and act out their greatest victories
- Doubt: Appears around cliffs or deserts and makes creatures hesitate, mistrusting their ability to climb or escape their current difficulties
- Fear: Appears in caves and ruins, overwhelming creatures with dread and urging them to give voice to their deepest fears
- Hatred: Appears in volcanic regions and provokes creatures to scream and destroy things
- Inspiration: Appears around memorials or natural wonders, causing creatures to create works of art on the spot and obsess over them
- Joy: Appears in glens or flowering fields, inspiring creatures to dance, relax, and sing
- Love: Appears along beaches or orchards and encourages creatures to confess their love to others and endlessly list their favorite things
- Sorrow: Appears in ruins and swamps, particularly around quicksand, and overwhelms creatures with sobbing and confessions of regret

### ENCHANTED SPRINGS

Enchanted springs brim with miraculous waters. whether they tap into magical sources hidden beneath the earth or they're blessed by eldritch beings. Those who find these mystical sites might bathe or drink from the pools and temporarily gain a measure of the waters' magic. All manner of protectors or covetous guardians might lurk around these springs, driving off strangers or demanding a worthy price for access to the mystical waters.

While many enchanted springs bear the blessings of wild gods or fey beings, some are tainted. These might be waters that were long ago polluted by the ichor of an evil entity. As with pristine enchanted springs, folk seek out such defiled places, whether to purify them or claim their foul powers.

Regardless of whether a spring is pure or tainted, creatures might need to drink the water to experience the spring's effects, simply touch the water, or bathe in it for a minute to trigger an effect.

Bottling an enchanted spring's water removes its magical properties, unless the bottle is a specially prepared vial blessed by whatever being enchanted the spring in the first place.

### ENCHANTED SPRING EFFECTS

#### d12 Effect

l

MAGIC MUSHROOMS

### MAGIC MUSHROOMS

Mushrooms can be deadly, delicious, or both. Some have magical properties, especially those that grow in areas suffused by mystical energy, such as the Underdark and the Feywild.

Creatures proficient in the Medicine, Nature, or Survival skills might be versed on the subject of fungi, especially the magical kind, since the beneficial effects can save lives or bestow unusual powers. But when an unknown variety of fungus is encountered, only an expert can identify it and determine its properties.

To determine the effects of eating such fungus. roll on the Magic Mushroom Effects table.

### MAGIC MUSHROOM EFFECTS

#### d10 Effects

### MIMIC COLONIES

Mimics imitate terrain and dungeon dressing to hunt for food. Rare specimens develop a deeper understanding of the world and can communicate with other creatures. In extremely rare cases, groups of these creatures band together, creating colonies. These bonded mimics cooperate to create larger objects than any lone mimic could approximate. A mimic colony can work together to form buildings, bridges, crystal formations, cliff faces, statues, and nearly anything it desires. Entire villages appearing out of nowhere might be composed of mimics!

Mimic Communication. Members of the colony develop telepathy and the ability to speak. While within 10 miles of the colony, any mimic can communicate telepathically with other creatures within 120 feet of it and can speak Common and Undercommon fluently (or two other languages of the DM's choice). The colony's offspring gain these abilities innately and can use them even away from the colony, as shown in the Juvenile Mimic stat block.

Confronting a Colony. A mimic colony's primary goal is survival. If threatened by a force the mimics can't overcome, they are willing to bargain. Mimic colonies have learned that adventurers they can't defeat can be bought off with information about nearby creatures or locations, hidden treasure (which the colony obtained from prior "food"), or even one of their own young.

### UVENILE MIMIC

False Appearance (Object Form Only). While the mimic remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.

Spider Climb. The mimic can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### ACTIONS

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) acid damage.

Shape-Shift. The mimic polymorphs into an object or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

If the colony's survival is threatened and it thinks it has a chance of surviving a fight, it can leverage its combined might using special lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), the mimic colony takes a lair action, causing one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- · The mimic colony chooses up to three creatures within 300 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until initiative count 20 on the following round, as pieces of the environment grasp the target. If a target fails the save by 5 or more, it is restrained instead for that duration.
- · The mimic colony uses the Help action, aiding a creature of its choice within 300 feet of it.
- · The mimic colony chooses up to three creatures within 300 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) acid damage, as orifices appear on surfaces in the environment and launch caustic spittle.
- The mimic colony chooses a cube of nonmagical, inanimate material in physical contact with it. The cube can be up to 15 feet on a side. The colony reshapes that material however it likes. This transformation lasts for 1 hour.

When determining the difficulty of an encounter with a hostile mimic colony, consider the colony to be one additional creature of challenge rating 2.

### PRIMAL FRUIT

In wild places brimming with nature's power, gardens meticulously tended by eccentric wizards, and blessed groves touched by divine providence, plants can sometimes produce fruit bursting with primal magic. Not every fruit-bearing plant holds this stored magic, but those that do bear obvious signs: their colors are more vibrant or shift randomly, their skin sparkles in the light or glows in the dark, soft hums emanate from them, or they feel peculiar to the touch.

A fruit-bearing plant that is suffused with magic might produce 1d6 pieces of primal fruit every week. Primal fruit remains potent for 1 week, after which it loses its magical properties but remains edible.

As an action, a creature can eat a piece of primal fruit to gain its effects. This fruit can be squeezed into juice or cooked into a dish and retains its magic. Choose an effect or roll on the Primal Fruit Effects table to determine what happens when a piece of the fruit is consumed. An identify spell or similar magic reveals the beneficial effect of a piece of fruit before it is eaten, but it doesn't reveal a curse or side effect.

### PRIMAL FRUIT EFFECTS

#### 48 Effect

- The creature regains 3d8 + 4 hit points, and its ] skin sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet for 1 hour
- The creature feels a surge of might. For 1 hour, 2 the creature has advantage on attack rolls using Strength, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws. When the effect ends, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion.
- 3 Waves of vitality crash over the creature. The creature's hit point maximum increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of hit points. The increase lasts until the creature finishes a long rest, at which time the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be cursed with a random form of lycanthropy (see "Lycanthropes" in the Monster Manual).
- 4 The creature's skin prickles faintly. For 1 hour, it gains resistance to one damage type (chosen by the DM).
- Euphoric visions of bright light swim through the 5 creature's mind. The creature gains the benefits of the death ward spell for 8 hours and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for the duration.
- 6 A faint humming drones in the background of everything the creature hears for 1 hour, during which the creature has advantage on saving throws against spells.
- 7 The creature doesn't require food, drink, or sleep for 1d4 days. For the duration, the creature can't be put to sleep by magic, and its dreams intrude upon its waking thoughts, imposing disadvantage on its Wisdom (Perception) checks.
- 8 Whispers intrude on the creature's mind for 24 hours. For the duration, the creature can telepathically communicate with any creature it can see within 120 feet of it. If the other creature understands at least one language, it can respond telepathically.

### UNEARTHLY ROADS

Currents of magic run through the world-invisible, artery-like networks that exert subtle influence and connect disparate lands. The greatest of these magical streams are persistent paths, often known by colloquial names or simply as unearthly roads. An unearthly road acts like a sort of planar portal that stretches from one place to another, be they sites on the same world or on different planes of existence. Unearthly roads allow creatures to cross great distances rapidly, moving from an entrance gate to an exit gate or visa versa. These paths operate like long tunnels, and a creature that travels on an unearthly road progresses 21 miles of distance in the time it would normally take it to travel 1 mile. While on the road, glimpses of the world bevond might be visible in blurred or distorted visions of scenery or especially prominent landmarks. Creatures or specific details are not visible beyond an unearthly road.

Some unearthly roads serve as trade routes or secret connections between distant lands. Others shift locations at noteworthy times or in response to external phenomena, like on specific anniversaries or in response to the phases of the moon. Some might also require a particular item, ritual, or action to open their gates. The Unearthly Road Keys table offers suggestions on how to enter an unearthly road.

### NATURAL HAZARDS

Even without the threats of supernatural environments, the world is a dangerous place. The following natural hazards expand on those presented in the Dungeon Masters Guide.

### AVALANCHES

A typical avalanche (or rockslide) is 300 feet wide, 150 feet long, and 30 feet thick. Creatures in the path of an avalanche can avoid it or escape it if they're close to its edge, but outrunning one is almost impossible.

When an avalanche occurs, all nearby creatures must roll initiative. Twice each round, on initiative counts 10 and 0, the avalanche travels 300 feet until it can travel no more. When an avalanche moves, any creature in its space moves along with it and falls prone, and the creature must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When an avalanche stops, the snow and other debris settle and bury creatures. A creature buried in this way is blinded and restrained, and it has total cover. The creature gains 1 level of exhaustion for every 5 minutes it spends buried. It can try to dig itself free as an action, breaking the surface and ending the blinded and restrained conditions on itself

with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature that fails this check three times can't attempt to dig itself out again.

A creature that is not restrained or incapacitated can spend 1 minute freeing a buried creature. Once free, that creature is no longer blinded or restrained by the avalanche.

### FALLING INTO WATER

A creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its reaction to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved.

### FALLING ONTO A CREATURE

If a creature falls into the space of a second creature and neither of them is Tiny, the second creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be impacted by the falling creature, and any damage resulting from the fall is divided evenly between them. The impacted creature is also knocked prone, unless it is two or more sizes larger than the falling creature.

### SPELL EQUIVALENTS OF NATURAL HAZARDS

Numerous spells emulate the wrath of nature, and you can use spell effects to represent a variety of natural hazards. The Spells as Natural Hazards table presents some common environmental dangers and the spells you may use to approximate them.

Why create a solvable puzzle? Just pose an enigmatic question without an answer and watch your trespassers squirm!

### TASHA

Devious traps and multifaceted mysteries might be staples of fantasy adventures, but they're not the easiest challenges for a DM to present on the fly. This section presents a selection of puzzles designed to invite group participation and challenge adventurers of any stripe-from genius scholars to martial masters. Each puzzle is flexible enough to be included in your campaign as presented or customized to fit the needs of a specific adventure.

### WHY USE PUZZLES?

Puzzles provide exciting opportunities to use wit to overcome obstacles and allow characters to collaborate to make discoveries. You might add a puzzle to an adventure for any of the following reasons:

- · To encourage a party to discover information through teamwork
- · To provide an opportunity for characters to use their skills in uncommon ways
- · To make a setting feel more whimsical, mysterious, or otherworldly
- · To explain why no one has ever discovered something hidden close at hand
- · To reveal a secret no one knows and magic can't reveal

Some puzzles can take considerable time to solve. so be mindful of how often you use them in your adventures. Remember, most puzzles don't need to be solved immediately, and they might be all the more satisfying if their riddles linger unresolved for multiple sessions.

### PUZZLE ELEMENTS

Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive in a location with a puzzle or when otherwise noted.

Additionally, the following sections appear in each puzzle:

- Difficulty. Each puzzle is classified as easy, medium, or hard. The harder the puzzle, the more likely the players will need hints to solve it.
- Puzzle Features. This section presents an overview of the puzzle's features and how they can be interacted with.
- Solution. This section explains how the puzzle is solved.
- Hint Checks. This section suggests hints that characters might use their skills to reveal. Provide one or more of the hints if the characters get stuck. If a character has proficiency in a hint's associated skill, give them that hint if they ask you for help.
- Customizing the Puzzle. This section explores how to integrate the puzzle into your adventures, alter its difficulty, or make other adjustments.

### HINTS

If players request a hint while attempting to solve a puzzle, consult that puzzle's "Hint Checks" section. Each hint is associated with a skill and a DC. If a character in the party has proficiency in a skill related to a hint, share that hint with them. If the same skill is listed multiple times with the same or higher DCs, reveal hints with the lowest DCs first then hints with higher DCs if the group requests additional help.

If no character has proficiency in any of the listed skills. characters can make ability checks using the listed skills and DCs. Those who succeed on a check learn the associated hint.

Don't hesitate to reveal hints to the party. Hints provide characters with relevant skills the opportunity to shine, even if they're not usually particularly cunning. Additionally, if party members have backgrounds or campaign experiences that might tie into a puzzle, those make great reasons to provide characters with additional hints.

### RUNNING PUZZLES

Once you've presented a puzzle to a group, feel free to add and clarify details as you would in any other type of encounter. Try not to give away details of the puzzle's solution in your descriptions, but there's nothing wrong with letting a hint slip here or there.

Don't worry whether it's a player or a character who's solving a puzzle. While hint checks provide a way for character experience to contribute to a puzzle's solution, ultimately the boundaries between a player's and a character's ability to solve a puzzle isn't as important as the group enjoying the challenge. However, if a player knows the answer to a puzzle in advance, urge them to share only hints their character learns.

After presenting a puzzle, encourage the party to solve it together, to pool hints, and to share their insights. Work with the group to share any puzzle handouts and to take turns talking through their thoughts. Ultimately, solving a puzzle will be a victory for the whole group, not one individual.

### CREATURE PAINTINGS

### Difficulty: Easy

This short puzzle works anywhere that makes sense for characters to peruse several paintings, such as in a museum or manor. These paintings could even appear in a sketchbook found in a dusty old drawer. This counting puzzle leads to a name of a creature.

Fit this into your campaign by making the name of the creature the first item on a scavenger hunt or the first clue in a larger mystery.

This gallery is decorated with seven framed paintings of creatures. A few chairs and benches have been placed in front of the art for viewing.

A plaque mounted on one of the walls bears the following dedication: "In order to gain all knowledge, one must know where to start. Count on your enemies to reveal the source of the secret. This room is dedicated to the defeat of all monsters within."

Characters should be free to explore the gallery and inspect the paintings and dedication to discover the parts of the puzzle.

### PUZZLE FEATURES

There are seven paintings on the walls. The paintings feature a gruesome werewolf under a full moon, a trio of gnolls fighting over a spear, a grinning beholder, two trolls sitting under a tree, five kobolds around a bonfire, two gelatinous cubes patrolling a dungeon corridor, and three dragons in flight.

### SOLUTION

Each painting features a number of creatures of a particular kind, as summarized in the Creature Paintings table. Counting into each creature's name by the number of creatures in the painting reveals a letter. When unscrambled, the letters spell out "owlbear." Characters are likely to reveal these letters in random order. Arranging them in the correct order is part of the puzzle.

### CREATURE PAINTINGS

| Painting | Number | Letter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gnolls | 3 | O |
| Werewolf |  | W |
| Kobolds |  |  |
| Beholder |  | B |
| Gelatinous Cubes | D | E |
| Dragons |  | A |
| Trolls |  |  |

### SIGNIFICANCE OF "OWLBEAR"

This puzzle's solution, "owlbear," might be the passphrase to bypass a future trap or unlock a magically sealed door. It might also be a clue that points to a hidden treasure. For example, there might be a stuffed owlbear in another room that has treasure hidden inside it.

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. The character deduces that the number of creatures in a painting is important and uses that number to determine which letter of the creature's name they should review.
- Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. When looking at the dedication, the words "count on" alert the character that they should count the creatures.

### CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

You can replace the monsters in the artwork with distinctive objects, members of obvious professions, and anything else that might logically be in a group. Then, follow the letter-counting method detailed in this puzzle to determine how many subjects should feature in each piece of art.

### RECKLESS STEPS

### Difficulty: Easy

This puzzle features a word search on floor tiles, which might present a barrier to exploration in myriad scenarios. To cross safely, characters must first uncover what words they're searching for and then find them in the tiles.

You enter a cobweb-filled room lit by torches on opposite walls. Dust on the floor has collected in grooves that cover rows of five-foot-square tiles. On the opposite wall, a solitary arch leads from the room. One wall bears the following inscription:

### Eight appear before your eyes,

And eight remain in schooled disguise. Avoid all magic in this room, Lest reckless steps ensure your doom.

The tiles covering the floor of this room each bear a single letter written in the Common alphabet, making the room a giant word search. Traps beneath many of the tiles threaten those who move through the room heedless of the hidden words.

### PUZZLE FEATURES

The floor of this 60-foot-bv-70-foot room is made of 5-foot-square stone tiles laid out in a grid. Each tile has a letter chiseled into it, as shown in puzzle handout 1 at the end of this chapter. Place a copy of the handout for this puzzle on the table, and allow players to use miniatures to show how their characters navigate the room.

To safely walk across the room, a character must step on the correct tiles. Stepping on an incorrect tile sets off a trap.

### TRAPS

Certain tiles (as indicated in this trap's "Solution" section) are trapped. A trapped tile is triggered when more than 20 pounds of weight are placed on it, activating the pressure plate underneath and causing jets of poisonous gas to spout from the cracks between the tiles. Any creature above the trapped floor tile or one of its adjacent tiles must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

As an action, a character can disable a trap with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. If a character fails to disable the trap, the tile's trap can no longer be disabled.

Characters can attempt to jump over trapped tiles, using the jump rules in the Player's Handbook.

### SOLUTION

The only safe tiles for characters to step on are the ones with the faded black letters in diagram 4.1. Red letters spell out either "magic" or one of the schools of magic: abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation. Stepping on one of these tiles triggers a poison trap, as described earlier.

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Intelligence (Arcana) DC 10. The character sees one instance of a school of magic on the floor.
- Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. The character interprets the clue in the wall verse: there are eight schools of magic.
- Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. Each character who succeeds on this check sees an instance of the word "magic" in the floor.

### CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

Consider using this puzzle's structure to create any number of thematic word searches hiding deadly traps. Once you've created a hint suggesting what types of words to look for, it's a simple matter to create your own grid of hidden words.

### RAISING THE DIFFICULTY

You can increase this puzzle's difficulty by changing the word search's letters to use another alphabet, such as those presented in the Plaver's Handbook. Alternatively, you can create an entirely new code to replace the letters, requiring the characters to find a cipher to reveal the tiles' meanings before they can undertake the puzzle and cross the room safely.

You can also increase the difficulty by introducing trap variants, as described below.

### TRAP VARIANTS

Rather than have the same poison gas trap on every trapped tile, each word can have a distinct trap associated with it, as described below:

- Magic. The trap triggers normally, as described in this puzzle's "Traps" section.
- Abjuration. The trap casts dispel magic on each creature in the room, using a 9th-level spell slot.
- Conjuration. The trap teleports the creature that triggered it back to the entrance of the room. That creature must also make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- Divination. The creature that triggered the trap must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be unable to perceive any of the letters

DIAGRAM 4.1: RECKLESS STEPS PUZZLE SOLUTION

on the tiles by sight or touch. Any magic that ends a curse ends this effect on the character. A player whose character is affected by this trap should not be allowed to reference the accompanying player handout until the effect on that character ends.

- Enchantment. The trap casts suggestion (save DC 15) on the creature that triggered it. On a failed save, a gentle voice only the creature can hear tells it to move 5 feet in a random direction. This movement might cause it to trigger another trap.
- Evocation. Magical fire erupts from the trapped tile. The creature that triggered this trap must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- Illusion. A suit of animated armor appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature that set off this trap. The armor attacks only the creature that summoned it and can't leave the room. It doesn't set off any of the room's traps and disappears if it takes any damage. Otherwise, it lasts for 1 minute.
- Necromancy. Any creature that triggers this trap hears a banshee's wail in its mind. Unless the creature is a construct or undead, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, it takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage.
- Transmutation. The trap casts polymorph (save DC 15) on the creature that triggered it. On a failed save, the creature turns into a giant frog.

### SKELETON KEYS

### Difficult v: Easy

This puzzle presents a quick encounter useful for providing treasure or information. It features a box with four locks.

You come upon a sinister metal box with an iron lock built into each of its four sides. Each lock sports a keyhole with a sculpted image above it. Four iron keys hang from hooks on a nearby wall, and each key has a different number of teeth. Above the keys, the following verse has been etched into the wall:

The spells on these locks are all the same.

Though each possesses a unique name. Count on your answer to unlock the way, But use the wrong key to your dismay.

All four locks must be opened before the box's contents (whatever they might be) can be accessed.

### PUZZLE FEATURES

Show the players puzzle handout 2 (see the end of this chapter) when their characters examine the keys. Each key has a different number of teeth: six, five, four, and three, respectively.

Each lock has a creature molded in iron above it: a bat, snake, spider, or wolf, respectively. These locks can't be picked. If anything other than the correct key is placed inside a lock, creatures corresponding to the image above the lock (1d4 giant bats, 1d4 giant poisonous snakes, 1d4 giant wolf spiders, or 1d4 wolves) are summoned into the room. Each summoned creature is hostile and disappears after 10 minutes or when reduced to 0 hit points. These beasts can't be charmed or frightened.

### SOLUTION

Once the characters identify the creature depicted above each lock, they should count the letters in each creature's name. The number of letters in a creature's name corresponds to the number of teeth on the correct key, as shown in the Skeleton Keys Solution table.

### SKELETON KEYS SOLUTION

| Lock | Key |
| --- | --- |
| Bat | Three teeth |
| Snake | Five teeth |
| Spider | Six teeth |
| Wolf | Four teeth |

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Intelligence (Nature) DC 10. The character knows that "natural" knowledge about bats, snakes, spiders, and wolves in general won't help here.
- Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character realizes that the keys' skull-shaped heads are all the same and probably have no bearing on the puzzle's solution.

### CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

The focal parts of this puzzle are the locks and keys, not the chest. You could easily convert this puzzle to feature any types of locks, be they on doors, cells, books, or some more esoteric barrier.

Beyond the form the locks and keys take, you might also consider adjusting the creatures depicted with each lock to suit your adventures. Just keep in mind that the number of teeth on each key must match the number of letters in your substitutions, and those substitutions should be things the characters can identify.

### RAISING THE DIFFICULTY

Rather than associating each lock with a particular image of a creature, consider presenting a riddle alongside each lock. The answer to each riddle should be the related creature's name, allowing characters to match the riddles' answers to the proper keys.

### ALL THAT GLITTERS

### Difficultv: Medium

This gem-filled room can be placed in any dungeon, estate, or building with multiple rooms and might serve as both a trap and a place to obtain a reward.

Dozens of gems lie strewn upon the floor. Amid the treasure stands a marble statue with its hands clasped in front of it. A placard at the statue's base reads, "Only one treasure may leave this room. Cross with another and find your tomb."

### PUZZLE FEATURES

The statue, which is impervious to damage, depicts Ioun or some other god of knowledge or order. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check can identify the figure being depicted.

### DIAMOND

Between the palms of the statue's clasped hands is a diamond, which can only be found and retrieved once the puzzle is solved. Once the characters solve the puzzle, the statue's hands open, allowing the diamond to be taken. Upon breaching the threshold of the room with the diamond, a trapped soul in the form of a friendly, thankful spirit is released. The spirit leaves to pursue its own goals, and the diamond is left behind as a reward. The diamond is worth 5,000 gp.

### GEMSTONES

An inventory of the room reveals the following gemstones scattered across the floor: eighteen pieces of jade, sixteen onyxes, fourteen amethysts, thirteen sapphires, twelve rubies, nine pieces of amber, eight citrines, five garnets, and one piece of quartz.

If a creature attempts to leave the room with any of these stones, the gem disappears and an angry spirit trapped inside it is released. The spirit manifests as a hostile undead creature of your choice, such as a ghost, specter, or skeleton. When this creature is reduced to 0 hit points, its form dissipates, leaving no trace of itself behind.

### NAMED SPIRITS

Characters hear each spirit whisper its name before it dissipates. The names themselves are not important, other than they must start with the appropriate letter of the alphabet.

The following list provides names for all the imprisoned spirits, each name starting with the letter associated with the spirit's gemstone prison:

A SPIRIT ESCAPES A GEMSTONE

### Quartz. Antonio

Garnet. Ella, Ethan, Ember, Edwina, Ernest

- Citrine. Hobert, Holden, Hilda, Haddon, Hugo, Hera. Hessy. Hemma
- Amber. Ivy, Iris, Ian, Idris, Iggy, Imelda, Ice, Innis. Isabella
- Ruby. Lou, Leela, Lowan, Lannis, Lake, Luke, Leila, Leean, Luna, Luvia, Lee, Leira
- Sapphire. Mona, Maethius, Merry, Moon, Medea, Martha, Marni, Moen, Mava, Moloth, Mo, Mia, Miranda
- Amethyst. Nox, Neville, Norman, Ned, Nadia, Nian, Nero, Nick, Narice, Nava, Nia, Nicol, Nestor, Nera
- Onyx. Paul, Pam, Pluck, Petra, Pax, Pia, Paden, Po, Pacey, Pima, Peck, Pablo, Piers, Pom, Peleg, Peet
- Jade. Ren, Ryannis, Rue, Romag, Redd, Remy, Ria, River, Rhonda, Resta, Rhys, Ron, Ricker, Rey, Ro, Rowan, Regan, Rhiannon

### SOLUTION

An inventory of the room reveals gemstones in the amounts shown in the Gem Inventory table. The table lists the gems in alphabetical order, but you should list them in any other order when describing them to players so not to accidentally give away a hint.

Each type of gem is associated with a letter of the alphabet, and each gem's letter is revealed by counting into the alphabet by a number of letters equal to the number of gems of its type. For example, there is one piece of quartz, so "quartz" corresponds to the first letter of the alphabet (A), while there are fourteen amethysts, so "amethyst" corresponds to the fourteenth letter of the alphabet (N).

### GEM INVENTORY

| Gem | Amount | Letter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Amber |  |  |
| Amethyst | 14 | N |
| Citrine | 8 | H |
| Garnet | 5 | E |
| Jade | 18 | R |
| Onyx | 16 | p |
| Quartz |  |  |
| Ruby | 12 |  |
| Sapphire | 13 | M |

Once the gems are sorted by type and alphabetized, characters can count into the alphabet by how many of each are in the room to reveal the words "in her palm." When a character speaks this phrase aloud, the statue's folded hands open, revealing the previously hidden diamond.

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Intelligence (Arcana) DC 15. The character can determine that there are spirits imprisoned in the gemstones scattered on the floor.
- Intelligence (Religion) DC 10. The character knows that the statue represents a god of knowledge and order, and the character has a strong feeling that the order of the gems in the room is important.
- Wisdom (Insight) DC 10. The character senses that the number of each type of gem isn't arbitrary.

### CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

This puzzle explores how to use groups of objects to disguise a message. So long as your groups can be arranged in a logical order (like the gems being arranged alphabetically in this puzzle), all you must do is adjust the number of items to correspond to a particular letter of the alphabet. Alternatively, perhaps another organizing principle orders your groups. For example, tombstones that feature varying numbers of skulls might be arranged by dates, while stacks of books might be ordered by shared page-counts. These details can be easy to miss,

though, so make sure you present a riddle or other signpost to make sure your players notice there's a puzzle at hand.

### LOWERING THE DIFFICULTY

To make the puzzle easier to solve, a spirit can provide a hint in addition to giving its name. Coaxing a hint from a spirit requires a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check. Consider hints like "A is the first letter in the alphabet" and "The gemstones, in order, will help for a spell."

### RELEASING THE SPIRITS

If the characters don't attempt to remove gems from the room, or if they spend too long deliberating, create a new trigger to release the spirits. For example, perhaps a spirit is released if a character places a gem near the statue or if it's held for too long.

### EYE OF THE BEHOLDER

Difficulty: Medium

This map puzzle is designed to lead a party through a dungeon where a roaming beholder doesn't wish to be disturbed. A series of clues tie to the word "eye," and the characters must determine how to get through the area safely.

A disorienting wave sweeps over you. Suddenly, your surroundings are unfamiliar and shrouded in shadows.

Out of the gloom appears a hooded goblin carrying a lantern.

"Hello, friends!" the goblin says. "I can help you through these parts-if you can figure out my riddles. You don't want to make a wrong turn in here, as there are eyes everywhere. Solve the riddles and follow my directions to the letter."

The goblin is friendly, and its offer is genuine. It's name is Igor (pronounced eye-gor), which it reveals only if asked. The characters find themselves in a maze that emits magical darkness that can't be dispelled. No vision can penetrate this darkness, and only the goblin's lantern can illuminate it. Igor's lantern emits light in a 5-foot radius, but only so long as the goblin holds it. The lantern goes dark if any other creature takes custody of it.

### PUZZLE FEATURES

The magical maze the characters find themselves in is comprised of an endless series of identical chambers. Each chamber has four passages, one at each cardinal direction. The goblin guide poses riddles that can lead the party along the path that ultimately

exits the maze. Each time the party moves through the correct passage and enters a new room, the goblin provides them with a new riddle that hints which direction to travel in next. If they make an error, the characters encounter a monster of your choice and then must backtrack from their last correct turn. After three wrong turns, the party encounters the beholder.

### HALLWAYS

The halls of this maze are 60 feet long and 10 feet wide. If the characters move away from the guide during combat or for any other reason, the goblin encourages them to follow him back to the last correct turn.

### THE GOBLIN'S RIDDLES

Upon meeting the characters (and to discourage them from attacking), the goblin makes it clear there is no way out of the maze without his help. Characters can determine that the goblin is sincere in wanting to help with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check.

Once the goblin has the characters' attention, it provides the first riddle, then waits for the party to venture down a passage of its choice. The goblin stops at each intersection and either provides the next riddle (if the party chose the correct path) or avoids the monster the group encounters (if the party chose the incorrect path), leading the characters back to the last correct chamber along the path after any battle.

The goblin's riddles (and their answers) are as follows:

- · What beast has the sharpest eye? (Eagle)
- · Threads get pulled through the eye of what? (Needle)
- · What is the eye to the soul? (Window)
- · Whose eye matters to a witch's brew? (Newt)
- · This eye curses you with misfortune. (Evil)
- · This eye brings a temporary calm. (Storm)
- · Roll a one on a six-sided die. Roll another and get the same. Take both together, and what's their name? (Snake eyes)

### SOLUTION

The answer to each riddle begins with a letter indicating the direction of the path the characters should follow next. The path provided by the riddles' answers takes the following route: east, north, west, north, east, south, south. This path leads the characters through some chambers more than once, which is a necessary part of the magic that will allow them to escape.

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Charisma (Persuasion) DC 15. The goblin provides a hint in the form of a synonym of the riddle's answer (for example, "lizard" for "newt").
- Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. After a few riddles are answered correctly, a character notices that all the answers relate to eyes.
- Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. After one or more correct answers are given, the character realizes that each answer corresponds to a cardinal direction.

### CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

The characters can easily persuade the goblin to ioin their party. What other secrets does the goblin know? Does he have an agenda for helping the characters find their freedom? And why has he lingered in the maze if he knows the way out? There might be more to this guide than meets the eye.

### FOUR BY FOUR

### Difficulty: Medium

This puzzle is easily situated in a dungeon, a dusty mausoleum, or an abandoned shrine.

You enter a dimly lit chamber. Nine dwarf skulls rest near a four-foot-square set of tiles in the floor, and carved into a nearby stone altar is the following inscription:

Brave warriors met their demise foretold. Their secret kept shall yet unfold. If crowns placed correctly on the shrine, Celestial beds for four of nine.

Solving this puzzle causes a secret compartment in the altar to open, revealing treasure hidden within. The compartment can't be opened in any other way.

### PUZZLE FEATURES

Nine dwarf skulls rest near a grid of 1-foot-square tiles, as shown in puzzle handout 3 (see the end of this chapter). Columns and rows in the grid are labeled with the markings I, II, or III.

### SOLUTION

The numbers labeling each row and column denote how many skulls belong within. Characters must place the skulls so that the correct number of skulls appear both in the rows and columns, while still covering four of the stars. This puzzle has multiple possible solutions, with one shown in diagram 4.2.

DIAGRAM 4.2: FOUR BY FOUR PUZZLE SOLUTION

Dwarf characters have advantage on ability checks to gain hints in this room. Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15. The verse indicates to the character that four of the skulls need to rest on tiles engraved with stars.
- Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The I, II, and III markings around the edge of the grid likely denote how many skulls must be placed in those rows and columns.

### CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

If one of the characters is a dwarf, this might be the perfect time to bring in a familial storyline. Are these the skulls of their long-lost clan? Does one of the skulls belong to a relative that they have been seeking? And what do they think the puzzle is implying with only four of the nine skulls receiving "celestial beds"?

### ILLUSIVE ISLAND

### Difficulty: Medium

Three numerical dials seal a box, door, or other locked object. Figuring out the correct combination is the goal of this puzzle, as there are no visible locks to pick.

### PUZZLE FEATURES

The numbers the dials are originally set to don't matter. If the players ask, choose any three digits you please.

A corked wooden tube contains two clues: a map of an island and a set of directions.

### MAP

Give the players a copy of puzzle handout 4 (see the end of this chapter). This map depicts an unfamiliar island with various landmarks but no key.

### DIRECTIONS

The directions are written on a single sheet of parchment and recount the route a group took in their search for treasure:

Day 1. Our search for the lost treasure began at the northwest inlet, Windstaff Cove. After unloading our necessities, we traveled east to Lone Pine, then southwest past Northridge to the Palms Oasis. As evening approached, we continued southeast to Anchor Point, then camped in the Great Dunes.

Day 2. In the morning, we arose at the Dunes and headed to Deadman's Cave. After finding it empty, our party continued to the Golden Ziggurat. Heading due east, we made camp at the Swirling Sands.

Day 3. After a strange night's sleep, we awoke on the third day back at Anchor Point with no memory or trace of traveling there. The Swirling Sands must have taken us in the night! We skirted the Swirling Sands to reach the Red Tower but still couldn't find the treasure. Thinking that we may have overlooked something in the cave, we headed back. From there, we headed to the southern coast to see if the treasure was at Kraken Point. Finding nothing, we returned to Anchor Point. What awaited us there was unlike any treasure we'd imagined.

### SOLUTION

Characters who follow the directions and trace their paths on the map reveal three numbers: 3. 4. and 8 (see diagram 4.3). Turning the dials to these numbers in the same order opens the locked object.

DIAGRAM 4.3: ILLUSIVE ISLAND PUZZLE SOLUTION

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

### Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. The word

- "trace" from the Day 3 entry strikes the character as important, suggesting that the map is meant to be drawn on.
- Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The map doesn't have labels, which means the names of the landmarks aren't significant. What's important are their positions relative to one another.
- Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The fact that the expedition lasted three days is significant, as there are three dials.
- Wisdom (Survival) DC 15. The character knows the directions don't represent an efficient way to search an area and deduces the directions must be presenting some sort of message.

### CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

Consider creating your own map and series of directions to customize this puzzle. By crafting directions that suit locations in your campaign's' setting, you can create a puzzle that's integrated into your adventure's plot, using a map the characters might already possess. Your version of the puzzle can add as many digits and directions as you see fit, or it might reveal letters, symbols, or short words, depending on the complexity of your design.

### RAISING THE DIFFICULTY

You can increase this puzzle's challenge by dividing the map into pieces that need to be separately discovered, or the characters might need to learn the directions from someone who personally explored the island. As long as the order of locations doesn't change, the code remains correct.

### MATERIAL COMPONENTS

### Difficulty: Medium

This puzzle might appear in a wizard's workshop, study, or spellbook. The solution leads to a password that reveals new or rare spells (such as those in chapter 3). Alternatively, the password can be used for any other function that fits with your story.

You find an old piece of paper bearing a list of spells and components. Random letters are also scratched quickly on the paper between the two lists. A message at the top of the page says, "read untouched to gain new spells."

Give the players a copy of puzzle handout 5 (see the end of this chapter).

### PUZZLE FEATURES

The wizard's study is filled with spell components, books, potions, and various odds and ends. While the various supplies might help characters solve

DIAGRAM 4.4: MATERIAL COMPONENTS PUZZLE SOLUTION

the puzzle, the only item the characters need is the parchment. If the puzzle is giving them grief, they can take the parchment with them and find others who can help them solve it.

### BOOKCASES

All around the wizard's study are shelves and cases filled with books, scrolls, and other supplies. A character who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check notices a spell component with no gp value from the list (such as a chip of mica or a bit of bat fur).

### LISTS

The parchment has a list of spells and a list of material components. However, the components to the right don't match with the adjacent spells to the left. The parchment itself doesn't have any magical qualities, but the word it reveals potentially does.

Wizards and other spellcasters can identify the correct spell components for any spell they know. but they must succeed on the Intelligence (Arcana) checks noted in the "Hint Checks" section below to recall the correct material components for any less familiar spells.

### SOLUTION

Drawing a line from a spell to its material component crosses out letters that fall between the columns, as shown in diagram 4.4. Once all spells are connected to components, the untouched letters spell out "presto," which, when said aloud with the paper in hand, causes one or more spell scrolls (or some other treasure of your choice) to magically appear.

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Intelligence (Arcana) DC 10. The character recalls up to three of the material components for spells on the list they don't currently know.
- Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The character suspects that the iumbled letters in the middle-or some number of them-probably spell out a command word, pass-phrase, or important clue.
- Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character notices that straight lines drawn between spells and material components cross through some of the letters in the center.

### CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

While spells and components make easy to associate lists, you might also consider creating your own version of this puzzle using paired sets of monsters and creature types, planes of existence and their native inhabitants, famous figures in a setting and their homelands, and so forth.

### LOWERING THE DIFFICULTY

If your party doesn't include characters with considerable magical expertise, consider adding art to the room's walls or on decorative book covers that reveal connections between the listed spells and components. These images might give away a few connections between the lists or lower the DCs of the puzzle's hint checks.

### RAISING THE DIFFICULTY

Rather than using common spells the characters might be familiar with, a more challenging version of this puzzle might feature lost spells or other lore the party has no way of knowing. Only by consulting experts, undertaking research, or further adventuring might the party reveal the connections between the two lists.

### MEMBERS ONLY

### Difficulty: Medium

A secret club, cultist meeting, or thieves' guild requires a password to enter. In this puzzle, those who guard a certain door are so secretive that they change the password constantly, fearing someone might have infiltrated their members' ranks.

You watch a figure approach an oak door with a slide window. The figure knocks, and a guard opens the window and says, "Six." The figure replies, "Three." The guard then opens the door, allowing the figure to enter.

This building seems to have only one entrance: the oak door with a small slide window. A guard opens the window and speaks a seemingly random number to anyone who knocks on the door.

### PUZZLE FEATURES

Even after observing the building from all angles. characters only see members entering through the one door after speaking to the guard.

### DOOR

The door is made of oak reinforced with 3-inch-wide iron bars. Three deadbolts secure the door, which is also barred from the inside, so there are no locks that can be picked from the outside.

### GUARD

A guard stands on the other side of the door around the clock, and the only way to speak with the guard is through the door's slide window. The guard can be any sort of talking creature, such as an assassin, a cult fanatic, or a thug. More monstrous options include a bugbear, wereboar, or nycaloth.

If a character knocks on the door, the guard slides open the window and gruffly gives a number, expecting the proper response. The guard gives a different number each time someone knocks. Any proper response grants a single character entry, and the guard only allows one member to enter at a time.

Characters who provide incorrect answers and attempt to enter again must disguise themselves in some way or be refused entry. The guard only willingly opens the door for someone who speaks the correct password. The guard raises the alarm if unauthorized people try to open or bypass the door, calling six more guards to help defend the entrance.

### MEMBERS

If the characters continue watching the door, they see up to four more visitors approach it. To eavesdrop on each exchange, the characters must succeed on a DC 12 group Dexterity (Stealth) check to remain hidden; if the group check fails, the visitor notices they're being observed and speaks quietly enough that their answer can't be overheard.

- Second Visitor. The guard opens the window and says, "Twelve." The visitor responds with "Six" and is allowed inside.
- Third Visitor. The guard opens the window and says, "Ten." The visitor responds with "Five" and is turned away.
- Fourth Visitor. The guard opens the window and says, "Seven." The visitor responds with "Five" and is allowed inside.
- Fifth Visitor. The guard opens the window and says, "Zero." The visitor responds with "One" and is turned away.

### SOLUTION

Each member that approaches the door is given a number by the guard. There is no mathematical equation here; the only valid response to a number given by the guard is the number of letters in the guard's number.

For example, one member was given the number "six." There are three letters in the word "six." so the password for that member is "three." More potential answers are provided in the Potential Passwords table.

### POTENTIAL PASSWORDS

| Number Provided | Response Required |
| --- | --- |
| One | Three |
| Two | Three |
| Three | Five |
| Four | Four |
| Five | Four |
| Six | Three |
| Eight | Five |
| Nine | Four |
| Eleven | Six |
| Thirteen | Eight |

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15. The character deduces there is no mathematical equation that connects the numbers exchanged between the guard and visitors.
- Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The character suspects that the answer has to do with the word, not the number.

### CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

Part of what makes this puzzle challenging is that it misleads players into thinking they're overhearing a mathematical equation. To figure out the solution, they have to first overcome their own assumptions. An easier version of this puzzle might involve counting the letters in any type of word the guard provides and responding with that number. Alternatively, the response to the guard's number might be any word with the same number of letters as that number-for example, "five" has four letters, making "duck" or "smog" suitable responses. The more your puzzle plays with numbers as words rather than digits, the more challenging it's likely to be.

### EXACT CHANGE

### Difficulty: Hard

This puzzle provides an elaborate, coin-based lock to any sort of door, vault, or other barrier.

The door here is locked and has no handle. Instead. there is a slot in the door with an engraving above it that reads, "Insert exact change here." Nearby, a wooden bowl of coins rests atop a wooden table.

The tabletop is engraved with nine squares in a three-by-three grid. Nailed to the table's leg is a piece of parchment with the following instructions:

Fifteen per column, fifteen per row; Diagonally, the same is so. A plea of warning to carefully count; No two places may hold the same amount. What coins in the center be fed through the door; Exact change for passage or trouble galore.

### PUZZLE FEATURES

The bowl on the table contains forty-five gold coins. The puzzle requires that an exact number of coins be fed into the slot into the door. If the wrong amount is deposited, it triggers either an alarm or a trap of your choice.

### SOLUTION

Diagram 4.5 shows how to divide the forty-five coins so that every square has a different amount and each row and column adds up to fifteen.

DIAGRAM 4.5: EXACT CHANGE PUZZLE SOLUTION

The verse explains that the door requires the amount of coins shown in the center square. Upon inserting exactly five coins, the locked door opens.

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15. The character realizes that if diagonal corners add up to ten, it makes filling out the rest of the grid much easier.
- Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The character figures out the placement of two numbers other than the center number.

### FOUR ELEMENTS

### Difficulty: Hard

This puzzle might appear anywhere elementals of earth, air, fire, and water serve as guardians. If the puzzle isn't solved correctly, one or more of these guardian elementals magically transform from statues and attack the characters.

The door slams behind you as you enter this hexagonal room. Four of the walls are covered in mosaics, each depicting the destructive force of one of the four elements. Four nine-foot-tall, stone statues of elementals line the far wall across from the closed door. Above the statues is a row of square tiles with triangular symbols painted on them. Four of these tiles have fallen off and lie strewn upon the floor, which bears the following inscription:

Four elementals trapped in stone, Their elements ordered to lock their home. Even patterns against all odd, A tile misplaced awakens its god. In proper order safely seal these four, Or best one of each to open the door.

Once the characters enter this room, the door behind them slams shut. It can be opened only by completing this puzzle, and there are no other exits.

### PUZZLE FEATURES

The mosaics, statues, and tiles are described below in greater detail.

### MOSAICS

The four wall mosaics depict the following:

- · A water elemental crashes through a city wall in a huge wave. In the center of the image is a triangle pointing downward.
- · An earth elemental looms over a group of warriors. A triangle pointing downward with a horizontal line through it is carved into its chest.
- · A fire elemental burns through a forest town. In the center of the flames is a triangle pointing upward.
- · An air elemental gusts through a stormy sky. Within the clouds is a triangle pointing upward with a line running horizontally through it.

### STATUES

The statues are actual elementals magically bound in stone. The magic that turned these elementals into statues is slowly coming undone, as the tile pattern that binds them has fallen apart.

### TILES

If the characters don't replace the four fallen tiles in their proper sequence, all four statues revert to their true forms at the same time and attack the characters. The exact timing of this event is left to you, but the characters should be given enough time to take a crack at solving the puzzle. The characters can also release the elementals individually by putting titles in the wrong order or orientation.

Puzzle handout 6 (see the end of this chapter) illustrates the row of tiles set into the wall above the statues. Without a check, the characters realize that four of the tiles fell down when the door slammed shut behind them. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a character can determine that these tiles are what keeps the elementals bound.

If a tile is placed in the wrong place in the row, the corresponding elemental is freed from its stone prison and attacks. Only one of each elemental appears:

- . If the improperly placed tile has an open triangle pointing downward, the water elemental is freed.
- · If the improperly placed tile has an open triangle pointing upward, the fire elemental is freed.
- · If the improperly placed tile has a triangle pointing upward with a horizontal line running through it, the air elemental is freed.
- · If the improperly placed tile has a triangle pointing downward with a horizontal line running through it, the earth elemental is freed.

### SOLUTION

The correct, complete pattern is shown here:

The odd-numbered tiles form a recurring pattern of open triangles that alternate between pointing up and down. Tiles 1, 5, 9, and 13 are upward-pointing triangles, while tiles 3, 7, and 11 are downward-pointing triangles.

The even-numbered tiles display a different pattern. Tiles 2 and 4 point downward, but the first of them has a line through the triangle. Tiles 6 and 8 follow the same pattern, but the triangles point up. The pattern then repeats, with tiles 10 and 12 being the same as tiles 2 and 4 and tile 14 being the same as tile 6.

Solving the puzzle or defeating all four elementals causes the door to the room to swing open.

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15. The character notes the words "even" and "odd" in the verse on the room's floor and believes they have some significance to the missing tiles.
- Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character can deduce which tiles correspond to which elementals.

### CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

Interweaving multiple patterns makes it easy to disguise them. With this in mind, you might use any group of symbols to create as elaborate a series of patterns as you please, then challenge players to fill in a missing segment. While the symbols in this puzzle refer to the four elements, you might use holy symbols, colors, dolls on a shelf, or any other repeating design to convey your puzzle.

When an elemental is defeated, it might leave behind a valuable gemstone, a map fragment, a clue to some other puzzle, or something similar.

### RAISING THE DIFFICULTY

To increase the difficulty of this puzzle, enforce a time factor: perhaps one elemental breaks free at the end of every five minutes of real time that pass until the puzzle is solved.

You can also raise the difficulty by having statues depict genies instead of elementals. In this case, replace the four elementals with a dao, a djinni, an efreeti, and a marid. These genies are compelled to attack the characters and can't be reasoned with.

### HAUNTED HALLWAY

Difficulty: Hard

Many unquiet spirits linger in the world because they can't bare to leave something behind. In this puzzle, finding the solution also means helping a lost soul find peace.

Six alcoves line this hall, each one numbered from one to six. On the floor of each alcove, a lit candle gently flickers.

From the hall's far end drifts a low moan. There, barely visible, sobs the apparition of a small girl hovering over a discarded rag doll. "Names, names," she cries. "I can remember them all except the one I need."

The spirit, Dolora, is a harmless apparition who won't engage the party in combat. If threatened, she vanishes and reappears at the opposite end of the hall, sobbing anew.

If approached with compassion, Dolora bemoans the fact that she can't pick up her doll until she speaks its name, which she has forgotten. She refuses to leave this place without the doll.

Dolora, who only recalls fragmented memories of her life, can't answer many questions. This is particularly true about the messages associated

with the alcoves in the hall (see "Alcoves" later in this section). While Dolora can't answer vague questions about the candles' clues (such as "Who is this talking about?"), she can provide the names of specific people when prompted. For example, if a character asks directly, "What was your mother's name?" Dolora provides the correct response. She also spells out the name, which is a clue that the spelling is important.

### PUZZLE FEATURES

Dolora can't leave the hall and avoids the alcoves.

### ALCOVES

The hall is lined with six alcoves, each one with a unique numeral between 1 and 6 carved above it. A verse scratched into the back wall of each alcove is made visible by the candlelight. Each verse is presented below, accompanied by a parenthetical explanation that shouldn't be shared with the players or their characters:

- Verse 1. "Not his keeper, nor he mine; loved and hated at the same time." (This refers to Dolora's brother, whose name was Sam.)
- Verse 2. "My first vision: her hazel eyes. My first sound: her lullabies." (This refers to Dolora's mother, whose name was Delia.)
- Verse 3. "Her lives she lost, all three by three, and through the dark this hunter sees." (This refers to Dolora's cat, whose name was Fifi.)
- Verse 4. "Lines in his face of life lived long; stories were his paternal song." (This refers to Dolora's grandfather, whose name was Tobias.)
- Verse 5. "Mentor and guide, her lessons learned. Knowledge measured by letters I earned." (This refers to Dolora's teacher, whose name was Johana.)
- Verse 6. "Loved to eat hay, just as her friends did; lived in one room with a shoat and a kid." (This refers to Dolora's horse, whose name was Alexia.)

Each verse describes someone who was close to Dolora. Once the characters determine who a verse is talking about, they may ask Dolora to provide the correct name. For example, "What is your cat's name?" is a valid question for verse 3. The spirit then answers, "Fifi," and she spells it aloud.

### CANDLES

Each candle is a simple, 6-inch-tall wax taper. While in this hall, the candles never melt down and can't be extinguished.

### RAG DOLL

If the characters examine the rag doll or ask Dolora about it, she imparts the following information:

"My doll knows all six-the first for the first, the second for the second, the third for the third, the fourth for the fourth, the fifth for the fifth, and the sixth for the sixth."

### SOLUTION

Once the characters learn all six names, they must extract one letter from each name, as noted in the Remembered Names table. An alcove's number determines which letter to extract; for example, "Alexia" is the name connected to the verse in alcove 6, and the sixth letter in that name is A.

### REMEMBERED NAMES

| Alcove | Name | Letter |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Sam | S |
| 2 | Delia |  |
| 3 | Fif | F |
| 4 | Tobias |  |
|  | Johana |  |
| 6 | Alexia | A |

The doll's name is Sefina. Once Dolora is told this, she picks up the doll, speaks its name, and disappears with it, her spirit having been laid to rest. If there's some piece of information you wish to have the spirit reveal to the party, such as the location of a nearby treasure or the secret of a more dangerous spirit, Dolora whispers this as she fades away.

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Charisma (Persuasion) DC 10. Dolora thinks of the character as her friend. When this character figures out the answer to a riddle, Dolora calls out the name of the person it's about unprompted (for example, as soon as the character says "mother" aloud, Dolora calls out "Delia").
- Charisma (Intimidation) DC 15. The character frightens Dolora into divulging information. She tells the character that she remembers the names of people she knew. Dolora also reveals that it's important that their names be spelled correctly, though she doesn't say why.
- Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15. The character interprets Dolora's cryptic clue about the doll as follows: "all six" refers to the six letters of the doll's name, which can be determined by gathering information from the verses in the six alcoves.

### WHAT'S ON THE MENU

### Difficulty: Hard

The characters discover that a popular local tavern is a front for a secret organization that they seek to join or infiltrate. The name of the tavern can be whatever you want it to be. One suggestion is the Cloak & Dagger.

To get their foot in the proverbial door, the characters must speak the correct password to the tavern-keeper, Holda Heidrun. They can discover this password by solving a puzzle hidden in the tavern's menu.

The tavern is crowded with happy people enjoying their food and drinks. Behind the bar, a stocky woman is wiping down the wooden bar top. She looks up as you enter and nods toward an empty table before her attention is drawn elsewhere. You see a copy of the tavern's menu on the table.

Customize the tavern and flesh out its occupants as you see fit.

In addition to being the tavern-keeper, Holda Heidrun is the keeper of many secrets. If the characters prod her for information, she asks for the password, and if the characters don't know it, she divulges nothing of consequence. "If you're worth your weight in copper," she says, "you'd speak the password to earn my trust."

### PUZZLE FEATURES

A sign at the bar declares that a meal costs 1 sp, a mug of ale costs 4 cp, a glass of fine wine costs 1 sp, and a bottle of fine wine costs 3 sp. The menu on the table contains a list of specialties the tavern serves, and how much each item costs. Only the menu is needed to solve the puzzle.

### MENU

Characters who peruse the menu see the items listed in the Menu Items table, in the order given.

### MENU ITEMS

| Item | Price |
| --- | --- |
| Corn and lentil soup | 12 cp |
| Rabbit stew | 1 cp |
| Ale and cheese pastry | 7 ср |
| Brandied ham and carrots | 9 ср |
| Grilled fish and carrots | 6 cp |
| Seared boar and potatoes | 9 ср |
| Dragonfire mead | 11 cp |

### SOLUTION

Arrange the menu items in alphabetical order, then count into each item by the number of letters indicated in its price, as shown in the What's On the Menu Solution table. Stringing the seven letters together forms the password: chimera.

### WHAT'S ON THE MENU SOLUTION

| Item (Price) | Letter |
| --- | --- |
| Ale and cheese pastry (7 cp) | C (7th letter) |
| Brandied ham and carrots (9 cp) | H (9th letter) |
| Corn and lentil soup (12 cp) | I (12th letter) |
| Dragonfire mead (11 cp) | M (11th letter) |
| Grilled fish and carrots (6 cp) | E (6th letter) |
| Rabbit stew (1 cp) | R (1st letter) |
| Seared boar and potatoes (3 cp) | A (3rd letter) |

The characters can figure out the password without putting the menu items in alphabetical order. Once they get all seven letters, they must solve the anagram to get the password.

Speaking the correct password to Holda grants access to whatever secrets she's keeping-fuel for the characters' next adventure.

### HINT CHECKS

Any character has the option of making these ability checks to receive a hint:

- Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) DC 15. The character convinces Holda to whisper the following hint: "Count your lucky coppers that we have seven choices on the menu for you."
- Dexterity (Stealth) DC 15. The character blends in with the crowd to eavesdrop on another table. overhearing the patrons discussing how they must have gotten a misprinted menu because the prices don't seem right, or bemoaning the fact that the menu doesn't list items in alphabetical order.
- Intelligence (History) DC 15. The character recalls stories of how secret messages used to be sent through taverns using common items anyone could access, such as menus.
- Wisdom (Perception) DC 15. The character notices the prices on the menu don't make much sense. For example, why is rabbit stew so much cheaper than corn and lentil stew?

### CUSTOMIZING THE PUZZLE

"Chimera" might not be the password but rather a reference to something or someone else in the tavern. Characters who solve the puzzle and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check might notice another patron wearing a cloak pin shaped like a chimera, or spot a shield emblazoned with a chimera hanging on a wall that conceals a secret door. Only after speaking to the patron or seeing what's on the other side of the secret door do the characters obtain the actual password, which can be anything you want.

You can easily change "chimera" to something else by swapping out menu items, choosing different letters within the replacement items, and adjusting the prices accordingly.

### LOWERING THE DIFFICULTY

Other tavern patrons can provide additional hints by talking among themselves in places where the characters can overhear them. A patron might say something like, "This inn keeps getting more expensive. With these fancy new meals, I'm surprised they aren't charging a copper per letter!"

A too-helpful barmaid might take pity on the struggling characters and walk them through the various menu items in the order that would allow them to skip the anagram (ale and cheese pastry, brandied ham and carrots, corn and lentil soup, dragonfire mead, grilled fish and carrots, rabbit stew, and seared boar and potatoes). She might even recommend that the characters "start with the ale and cheese pastry, and continue on from there."
