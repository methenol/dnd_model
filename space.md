#### INTRODUCTION

# Vast Oceans of Adventure

N A D&D GAME, ADVENTURES CAN UNFOLD IN any corner of the multiverse-not just in the dungeons and wildernesses of the Material Plane but also on other planes of existence, including what celestial navigators refer to as Wildspace. When you stand on a Material Plane world and look up at the night sky, what you're seeing is Wildspace and, beyond that, the Astral Sea. Exploring these realms and the worlds they surround is the crux of a Spelljammer campaign.

# TERMINOLOGY

The Astral Plane is, quite literally, the plane of stars. More precisely, it is where the stars and portals to the heavens reside-an infinitely vast celestial void that surrounds all the worlds of the Material Plane.

Every D&D world-whether round, flat, or some other shape-exists in an airless void known as Wildspace. A world might be solitary, or it might have neighbors: one or more suns, worlds, moons, asteroids, comets, or other bodies. This neighborhood of celestial and planetary bodies is called a Wildspace system.

In Wildspace, the Material Plane and the Astral Plane overlap. Creatures and objects in Wildspace age normally and are effectively on both of those planes at once. If you were to leave your home world and continue outward until you neared the edge of your Wildspace system, you would begin to see a faint, silvery haze. By traveling into this haze, you pass from Wildspace into the Astral Sea, more colorfully known as the Silver Void. The deeper into the Astral Sea you travel, the thicker and brighter the haze becomes, but the stars that shine through it are always visible. Wildspace and the Astral Sea together comprise the Astral Plane.

The Astral Sea, like Wildspace, is a void; however, it is not an airless one. Here, you can breathe normally and exist indefinitely, never aging and never needing food or drink. You can propel yourself through the Astral Sea with the power of your mind alone, though many astral voyagers wisely travel in well-armed ships, for this place is the home of a host of fearsome creatures. Here travelers might find the petrified hulks of dead gods and swirling pools of color that serve as portals to other planes of existence. (For more information about color pools, see the Dungeon Master's Guide.)

Much in the way that oars and strong winds enable travel by sea on terrestrial worlds, magic items called spelliamming helms are used to propel and steer ships through Wildspace and the Astral Sea. A spelljamming helm customarily takes the form of an ornate chair in which the ship's pilot sits. To attune to a spelljamming helm, one must be a spellcaster. The pilot of a spelljamming ship is called a spelljammer.

# USING THIS BOOK

Most of the Astral Adventurer's Guide is designed to be shared with players. Think of this book's chapters as a primer for creating characters and running adventures in the uncharted void that surrounds each of the worlds of the Material Plane:

- Chapter 1 contains new material for players, including two backgrounds and six race options.
- Chapter 2 gives players and DMs rules for spelljamming as well as statistics and illustrations for various spelljamming vessels. The chapter also includes a few spells and magic items that are popular among astral voyagers.
- Chapter 3 describes the Rock of Bral, a city built on an asteroid, which you can use as a port of call or a campaign hub. You can situate it anywhere in Wildspace or the Astral Sea.

# ASTRAL CAMPAIGNS

Light of Xaryxis, the adventure included in this product, begins on a world of your choice but quickly moves into Wildspace after the characters board a ship that turns out to be a spelljamming vessel. The First Adventure table offers alternative ways to launch a D&D campaign set mostly on the Astral Plane.

If you choose to start your campaign on the Rock of Bral (see chapter 3), work with your players to determine which characters have lived in the city long enough to know it well.

#### DM SCREEN

Some of the information in this book is repeated on the accompanying DM screen, which also includes useful tables.

WILDSPACE IS LIKE AN OCEAN-A REALLY REALLY BIG ONE.

#### FIRST ADVENTURE

#### d10 Adventure Seed

- The adventure begins on the Rock of Bral, where ] an autognome (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) needs the characters' help to find its creator, who has gone missing on the Rock.
- 2 One of the characters inherits a ship equipped with a spelljamming helm and an old captain's log that hints at places to explore, treasure to find, and perils to avoid.
- 3 In the wilderness on their home world, the characters find a spelljamming helm in the wreckage of a crashed scorpion ship (see chapter 2) and run afoul of goblins who want to plunder the wreck.
- A wealthy patron gives the characters a ship and 4 a spelljamming helm to call their own and expects them to accomplish a dangerous task in return.
- 5 A spelljamming ship lands on the outskirts of a village where the characters are staying. The ship's captain is looking for raw recruits to join a war in Wildspace.
- Villagers ask the characters to investigate a 6 strange object in the hills, which turns out to be a crashed nightspider (see chapter 2) with survivors: a neogi pirate and a neogi hatchling swarm (see Boo's Astral Menagerie for both).

#### d10 Adventure Seed

7

- A hadozee explorer (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) needs the characters' help to slay a white kindori (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) that keeps attacking her flying fish ship (see chapter 2). The hadozee can't tell whether the kindori is mean-spirited or amorous. Perhaps it has mistaken the ship for a rival-or a mate!
- 8 The characters were passengers aboard a spelljamming ship that crash-landed on a strange world after the spelljamming helm malfunctioned. The characters must fend off alien monsters until they are rescued.
- The characters are hired by a trading company 9 to protect a valuable cargo that's being delivered to a distant world. The characters become crew members aboard the squid ship (see chapter 2) that is transporting the precious cargo.
- 10 The adventure begins on the Rock of Bral, where one or more characters have earned the enmity of a plasmoid boss (see Boo's Astral Menagerie). The heroes must either flee Bral to save themselves or contend with the boss's underlings.

Spacefaring adventurers leave their damselfly ship behino AND EXPLORE A NEW WORLD IN PURSUIT OF THEIR LATEST QUEST.

# CHAPTER 1 Character Options

HEN YOU CREATE A CHARACTER FOR A campaign or an adventure set in Wildspace or the Astral Sea, you can choose from any of the options that the D&D game provides, including those described in this chapter. As always, you should check with your DM before creating a character to make sure the options you prefer are available.

# BACKGROUNDS

The following backgrounds are good choices for 1st-level characters who have strong ties to the Astral Plane.

### ASTRAL DRIFTER

For longer than you can remember, you have traversed the Astral Sea. There, you experienced firsthand the wonders of the Silver Void: you stopped aging and no longer felt hunger or thirst. Driven by wanderlust, you drifted from one part of the Astral Sea to another, like a mote of dust on the wind. You have lost count of the decades that have passed since you arrived here.

In your travels, you have camped on the petrified hulks of dead gods and narrowly escaped the psychic winds that sweep across the Astral Sea while also avoiding prolonged contact with the plane's most dangerous denizens.

#### Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion

- Languages: Two of your choice (Celestial or Gith recommended)
- Equipment: A set of traveler's clothes, a diary, an ink pen, a bottle of ink, and a pouch containing 10 gp

#### LONGEVITY

You are 20d6 years older than you look, because you have spent that much time in the Astral Sea without aging.

#### FEATURE: DIVINE CONTACT

You gain the Magic Initiate feat from the Player's Handbook and must choose cleric for the feat.

In the Astral Sea, you crossed paths with a wandering deity. The encounter was brief and nonviolent, yet it made a lasting impression on you. This deity saw fit to share one secret or obscure bit of cosmic lore with you. Work with your DM to determine the details of this knowledge and its impact on the campaign.

Roll on the Divine Contact table to determine which deity you encountered, or work with your DM to identify a more suitable choice.

#### DIVINE CONTACT

#### d10 Wandering Deity

- Corellon, god of art and magic (chaotic good) ]
- 2 Tymora, god of good fortune (chaotic good)
- 3 Fharlanghn, god of horizons and travel (neutral good)
- 4 Istus, god of fate and destiny (neutral)
- 5 Nuada, god of war and warriors (neutral)
- Zivilyn, god of wisdom (neutral) 6
- 7 Arawn, god of life and death (neutral evil)
- 8 Hecate, god of magic and moons (chaotic evil)
- Celestian, god of stars and wanderers (neutral) 9
- 10 Ptah, god of knowledge and secrets (lawful neutral)

PLASMOID ASTRAL DRIFTER

GITHYANKI WILDSPACER

#### WILDSPACER

You were raised in the void of Wildspace-home to asteroid miners, moon farmers, and other hardy folk. Perhaps you grew up in a far-flung settlement such as the Rock of Bral (described in chapter 3), or you spent your early years on the crew of a spelljamming ship, performing helpful chores such as swabbing the deck, loading and offloading cargo, and scraping barnacles off the hull.

Whatever your history, life in Wildspace has toughened you so well that you are as brave as a miniature giant space hamster when it comes to facing the terrors and other challenges of the airless night.

Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival Tool Proficiencies: Navigator's tools, vehicles (space)

- Equipment: A belaying pin (club), a set of traveler's clothes, a grappling hook, 50 feet of hempen rope, and a pouch containing 10 gp
#### CLOSE ENCOUNTER

You had a harrowing encounter with one of Wildspace's many terrors. You escaped with your life, but the encounter left you with a scar or two, or perhaps a recurring nightmare. Roll on the Close Encounter table to determine which creature nearly got the best of you. Creatures marked with an asterisk appear in Boo's Astral Menagerie; the others are described in the Monster Manual.

#### CLOSE ENCOUNTER

|
|  |

- l Beholder
- 2 Cosmic horror*
- 3 Feyr *
- 4 Lunar dragon*
- 5 Mind flayer
- 6 Neh-thalggu*
- 7 Neogi*
- 8 Space clown*
- 9 Vampirate %
- 10 Void scavver*

#### FEATURE: WILDSPACE ADAPTATION

You gain the Tough feat from the Player's Handbook. In addition, you learned how to adapt to zero gravity. Being weightless doesn't give you disadvantage on any of your melee attack rolls (see "Weightlessness" in chapter 2).

# RACES

This chapter describes six race options available to players with the DM's consent:

Astral elf, an elf denizen of the Astral Plane who is possibly hundreds of years old

Autognome, a mechanical gnome who has free will Giff, a hippo-headed being of impressive size

- Hadozee, a simian being who adapts well to the hazards of Wildspace
Plasmoid, an amoeba-like person Thri-kreen, a telepathic, insectile being

Githyanki are natives of the Astral Plane. If you want to play one, the githyanki race option is presented in Monsters of the Multiverse.

#### CREATING YOUR CHARACTER

When you create your D&D character, you decide whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races, which include the races presented in this chapter. If you create a character using a race option presented here, follow these additional rules during character creation.

#### ABILITY SCORE INCREASES

When determining your character's ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You're free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

#### LANGUAGES

Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player's Handbook offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign.

#### CREATURE TYPE

Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the cure wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Construct type. (The autognome, described later in this chapter, is a noteworthy exception because of its Healing Machine trait.)

#### LIFE SPAN

The typical life span of a player character in the D&D multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn't meet a violent end on an adventure. Members of some races, such as dwarves and elves, can live for centuries-a fact noted in the description of the race in question.

#### HEIGHT AND WEIGHT

Player characters, regardless of race, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you'd like to determine your character's height or weight randomly, consult the Random Height and Weight table in the Player's Handbook, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.

# ASTRAL ELF

Long ago, groups of elves ventured from the Feywild to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. Life in the Silver Void has imbued their souls with a spark of divine light. That light manifests as a starry gleam in an astral elf's eyes.

Because nothing ages on the Astral Plane, astral elves who inhabit that plane can be very old, and their longevity gives them an unusual perspective on the passage of time. Some are prone to melancholy, while others might display an absence of feeling. Many look for creative ways to occupy themselves. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see things through the lens of time as having little or no meaning to them. Astral elves who don't dwell on the Astral Plane can live to be more than 750 years old.

#### ASTRAL ELF TRAITS

You have the following racial traits.

Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Size. You are Medium.

- Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet.
Astral Fire. You know one of the following cantrips of your choice: dancing lights, light, or sacred flame. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it (choose when you select this race).

Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of yourself as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.

Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

Starlight Step. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Astral Trance. You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you remain conscious.

Whenever you finish this trance, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice and with one weapon or tool of your choice, selected from the Player's Handbook. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory and the experiences of entities on the Astral Plane, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.

IO

# AUTOGNOME

Autognomes are mechanical beings built by rock gnomes. Sometimes, because of a malfunction or a unique circumstance, an autognome becomes separated from its creator and strikes out on its own.

An autognome bears a resemblance to its creator, and most autognomes are programmed to speak and understand Gnomish. The internal components used in an autognome's manufacture can vary wildly; one autognome might have an actual beating heart in its chest cavity, while another might be powered by stardust or intricate clockwork gears.

Roll on the Autognome History table or choose an entry that you like to identify what event set you on the path to adventure. If nothing on the table appeals to you, work with your DM to create an origin story for your character.

Like gnomes, autognomes can live for centuries, typically up to 500 years.

#### AUTOGNOME HISTORY

#### de Story

- l Your creator gave you autonomy and urged you to follow your dreams.
- Your creator died, leaving you to fend for yourself. 2
- 3 A glitch caused you to forget your original programming. You don't remember who made you or where you came from.
- 4 You didn't like how you were being treated by your creator, so you ran away from home.
- 5 You were built to complete a special mission.
- 6 You felt trapped in the role for which you were built and abandoned your creator, determined to find a greater purpose.

#### AUTOGNOME TRAITS

You have the following racial traits.

- Creature Type. You are a Construct. Size. You are Small.
Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet.

Armored Casing. You are encased in thin metal or some other durable material. While you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

Built for Success. You can add a d4 to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make, and you can do so after seeing the d20 roll but before the effects of the roll are resolved. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Healing Machine. If the mending spell is cast on you, you can spend a Hit Die, roll it, and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

In addition, your creator designed you to benefit from several spells that preserve life but that normally don't affect Constructs: cure wounds, healing word, mass cure wounds, mass healing word, and spare the dying.

Mechanical Nature. You have resistance to poison damage and immunity to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being paralyzed or poisoned. You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.

Sentry's Rest. When you take a long rest, you spend at least 6 hours in an inactive, motionless state, instead of sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but you remain conscious.

Specialized Design. You gain two tool proficiencies of your choice, selected from the Player's Handbook.

# GIFF

Giff are tall, broad-shouldered folk with hippo-like features. Some have smooth skin, while others have short bristles on their faces and the tops of their heads. As beings of impressive size and unforgettable appearance, giff are noticed wherever they go.

Most giff believe they originated on one world, but their home world is now the stuff of legend, because no living giff has seen it or knows where it is. The divine beings who created giff have likewise been forgotten. Their titanic petrified bodies drift on the Astral Sea, isolated and unrecognizable in their current forms.

Although they don't realize it, giff are drawn to the Astral Plane because, on a deep psychic level, they remain connected to their creator gods, who have just enough divine spark left in them to imbue giff with sparks of their own, which giff have learned to channel through their weapons. Most giff have no idea where this so-called astral spark comes from, but they feel its presence most strongly when they are in Wildspace or the Astral Sea.

Giff are split into two camps concerning how their name is pronounced. Half of them say it with a hard g, half with a soft g. Disagreements over the correct pronunciation often blossom into hard feelings, loud arguments, and head-butting contests, but they rarely escalate beyond that.

#### GIFF TRAITS

You have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid. Size. You are Medium.

Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

Astral Spark. Your psychic connection to the Astral Plane enables you to mystically access a spark of divine power, which you can channel through your weapons. When you hit a target with a simple or martial weapon, you can cause the target to take extra force damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, but you can use it no more than once per turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Firearms Mastery. You have a mystical connection to firearms that traces back to the gods of the giff, who delighted in such weapons. You have proficiency with all firearms and ignore the loading property of any firearm. In addition, attacking at long range with a firearm doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack roll.

Hippo Build. You have advantage on Strengthbased ability checks and Strength saving throws. In addition, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

# HADOZEE

The first hadozees were timid mammals no bigger than housecats. Hunted by larger natural predators, the hadozees took to the trees and evolved winglike flaps that enabled them to glide from branch to branch.

Several hundred years ago, a wizard visited Yazir, the hadozee home world, with a small fleet of spelljamming ships. Under the wizard's direction, apprentices laid magic traps and captured dozens of hadozees. The wizard fed the captives an experimental elixir that enlarged them and turned them into sapient, bipedal beings. The elixir had the side effect of intensifying the hadozees' panic response, making them more resilient when harmed. The wizard's plan was to create an army of enhanced hadozee warriors for sale to the highest bidder. But instead, the wizard's apprentices grew fond of the hadozees and helped them escape. The apprentices and the hadozees were forced to kill the wizard, after which they fled, taking with them all remaining vials of the wizard's experimental elixir.

With the help of their liberators, the hadozees returned to their home world and used the elixir to create more of their kind. In time, all hadozee newborns came to possess the traits of the enhanced hadozees. Then, centuries ago, hadozees took to the stars, leaving Yazir's fearsome predators behind.

In addition to being natural climbers, hadozees have feet that are as dexterous as their hands, even to the extent of having opposable thumbs. Membranes of skin hang loosely from their arms and legs. When stretched taut, these membranes enable hadozees to glide. Hadozees wrap these wings around themselves to keep warm.

#### HADOZEE TRAITS

You have the following racial traits. Creature Type. You are a Humanoid.

Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

Dexterous Feet. As a bonus action, you can use your feet to manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, or pick up or set down a Tiny object.

Glide. If you are not incapacitated or wearing heavy armor, you can extend your skin membranes and glide. When you do so, you can perform the following aerial maneuvers:

- · You can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend in the air, at no movement cost to you.
- · When you would take damage from a fall, you can use your reaction to reduce the fall's damage to 0.

Hadozee Resilience. The magic that runs in your veins heightens your natural defenses. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. Add your proficiency bonus to the number rolled, and reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to that total (minimum of 0 damage).

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# PLASMOID

Plasmoids are amorphous beings with no typical shape. In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar shape, but there's little chance of mistaking a plasmoid for anything else. They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most plasmoids are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores.

Plasmoids don't have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves. These nerves enable a plasmoid to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Plasmoids can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound.

When plasmoids sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are thus sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment.

#### PLASMOID TRAITS

You have the following racial traits.

Creature Type. You are an Ooze.

Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet.

Amorphous. You can squeeze through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide, provided you are wearing and carrying nothing. You have advantage on ability checks you make to initiate or escape a grapple.

Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of yourself as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

Hold Breath. You can hold your breath for 1 hour. Natural Resilience. You have resistance to acid and poison damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.

Shape Self. As an action, you can reshape your body to give yourself a head, one or two arms, one or two legs, and makeshift hands and feet, or you can revert to a limbless blob. While you have a humanlike shape, you can wear clothing and armor made for a Humanoid of your size.

As a bonus action, you can extrude a pseudopod that is up to 6 inches wide and 10 feet long or reabsorb it into your body. As part of the same bonus action, you can use this pseudopod to manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, or pick up or set down a Tiny object. The pseudopod contains no sensory organs and can't attack, activate magic items, or lift more than 10 pounds.

# THRI-KREEN

Thri-kreen have insectile features and two pairs of arms. Their bodies are encased in protective chitin. They can alter the coloration of this carapace to blend in with their natural surroundings.

Although thri-kreen don't sleep, they do require periods of inactivity to revitalize themselves. During these periods, they are fully aware of what's happening around them.

Thri-kreen speak by clacking their mandibles and waving their antennae, indicating to other thri-kreen what they are thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this method of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. To interact with other folk, thri-kreen rely on a form of telepathy.

#### THRI-KREEN TRAITS

You have the following racial traits.

Creature Type. You are a Monstrosity.

Size. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

Speed. Your walking speed is 30 feet.

Chameleon Carapace. While you aren't wearing armor, your carapace gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

As an action, you can change the color of your carapace to match the color and texture of your surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in those surroundings.

Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of yourself as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

Secondary Arms. You have two slightly smaller secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms can manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, pick up or set down a Tiny object, or wield a weapon that has the light property.

Sleepless. You do not require sleep and can remain conscious during a long rest, though you must still refrain from strenuous activity to gain the benefit of the rest.

Thri-kreen Telepathy. Without the assistance of magic, you can't speak the non-thri-kreen languages you know. Instead you use telepathy to convey your thoughts. You have the magical ability to transmit your thoughts mentally to willing creatures you can see within 120 feet of yourself. A contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with you to understand your thoughts, but it must be able to understand at least one language. Your telepathic link to a creature is broken if you and the creature move more than 120 feet apart, if either of you is incapacitated, or if either of you mentally breaks the contact (no action required).

# CHAPTER 2 Astral Adventuring

F YOU'RE A PLAYER OR A DUNGEON MASTER who wants to know more about spelliamming and the Astral Plane, this chapter is for you. It expands on what's written about the Astral Plane in the Dungeon Master's Guide and includes an assortment of spells, magic items, and spelljamming ships.

# How SPELLIAMMING WORKS

Spelljamming is the act of using a spelljamming helm (described later in the chapter) to propel and maneuver a ship. The individual that operates the helm is called a spelljammer.

#### SPEED

When cruising through space, a spelljamming ship can travel 100 million miles in 24 hours. At this speed, the spelljamming helm makes minor course corrections on its own to avoid collisions with meteorites, other detritus, and space-dwelling creatures. These slight course corrections sometimes cause mild space sickness, which is a harmless affliction common among those who aren't accustomed to space travel.

A spelljamming ship automatically slows to its flying speed (discussed later in this chapter) when it comes close to something big enough to have its own air envelope and gravity plane (see "Air Envelopes" and "Gravity Planes" below), such as another ship, a kindori (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), an asteroid, or a planet. The exact distance between the obstacle and the ship is for the DM to decide, but whatever obstacle caused the ship to slow down is usually close enough to be seen by creatures on deck. While moving at its flying speed, a spelljamming ship is generally as maneuverable as a seafaring vessel of a similar size.

#### SENSATIONS

Using a spelljamming helm to move a ship produces a feeling in the spelljammer similar to moving a limb that has fallen asleep-a pins-and-needles sensation, though not as painful as its analog. When the ship approaches something large in space, the spelljammer is usually the first to detect it as the ship slows down. An experienced spelljammer can often sense what caused the ship to slow down a few moments before it can be seen; an asteroid "feels" different from a space galleon or a pod of kindori, for example.

#### SPELLIAMMER DUELS

A ship can have more than one spelliamming helm aboard it, but only one spelljamming helm at a time can be used to control the ship. If a spelljammer tries to gain control of a ship by using a second spelliamming helm, a spelliammer duel ensues. Resolve this conflict by having each spelljammer make a Constitution check; if the dueling spelljammers tie, have them reroll. The spelljammer with the lowest check result loses the duel and gains 1d4 levels of exhaustion; in addition, their attunement to their spelljamming helm ends at once, and they can't attune to any spelljamming helm until all levels of exhaustion are removed from them.

# AIR ENVELOPES

When a creature or an object leaves a planet's atmosphere and enters Wildspace, an envelope of breathable air forms around it and lasts until that air is depleted.

#### AIR ENVELOPES OF CREATURES

The envelope of breathable air that forms around a creature takes the shape of a cube centered on that creature. The creature's size determines the cube's dimensions, as shown in the Air Envelopes of Creatures table.

#### AIR ENVELOPES OF CREATURES

| Creature's Size | Air Envelope |
| --- | --- |
| Tiny | 21/2-foot cube |
| Small or Medium | 5-foot cube |
| Large | 10-foot cube |
| Huge | 15-foot cube |
| Gargantuan | 20-foot cube |

A creature that needs to breathe will exhaust the air in its personal envelope in 1 minute. Since this is barely enough time to get anywhere, most creatures travel through Wildspace aboard spelljamming ships, which have much larger air envelopes.

#### FIRE IN WILDSPACE

Although nonmagical fire cannot exist in the vacuum of Wildspace, magical fire (such as that created by a fireball spell) does burn in a vacuum. Magical fire does not cause objects to burst into flame, however, because there is no air to make ignition possible.

I7

DIAGRAM 2.1: AIR ENVELOPE AND GRAVITY PLANE

#### AIR ENVELOPES OF OBJECTS

The envelope of breathable air that forms around an object extends out from its surface a distance equal to the longest dimension of its form. For example, a spherical planet 5,000 miles in diameter has an air envelope 15.000 miles in diameter, with the planet at the center of it. An air envelope need not be spherical; for example, a block of wood 1 foot by 2 feet by 3 feet is surrounded by a more-or-less rectangular envelope of air 3 feet by 6 feet by 9 feet.

The air envelope around a spelljamming ship typically has an ovoid shape. Diagram 2.1 shows the air envelope that surrounds a nautiloid that has a keel length of 180 feet. It extends 180 feet from the ship in all directions.

The air envelope around a habitable planet or moon is called an atmosphere. An atmosphere is a special kind of air envelope that replenishes itself constantly. A creature or an object can refresh its air envelope by entering the atmosphere of a planet or moon (see "Overlapping Air Envelopes" below).

#### AIR QUALITY

The air envelope around a body or ship can be fresh, foul, or deadly. Air can change from one quality to another over time.

Fresh air is completely breathable. Under normal circumstances, the air envelope of a ship remains fresh for 120 days. If a ship carries more creatures than its normal crew complement, they exhaust the supply of fresh air more quickly.

Foul air is stale and partially depleted. It is humid and smells bad. Any creature that breathes foul air becomes poisoned until it breathes fresh air again. The air aboard a ship with a normal crew complement degrades from fresh to foul on day 121, and the foul air turns deadly 120 days later.

Deadly air is unbreathable. Any creature that tries to breathe deadly air begins to suffocate (see the rules on suffocation in the Player's Handbook).

#### OVERLAPPING AIR ENVELOPES

When two bodies come close enough to each other, their air envelopes merge, and the quality of the air around the smaller body changes to match that of the larger body. When the bodies later move away from each other, each one reclaims and retains its own air envelope.

For example, if a damselfly ship with a foul air envelope enters the atmosphere a planet with fresh air, the two air envelopes merge, and the damselfly ship's air quality changes from foul to fresh. If that ship then merges its fresh air envelope with the

deadly air envelope surrounding a derelict ship, the damselfly ship's air quality would change from fresh to deadly.

# GRAVITY PLANES

The reason everything pulls its own atmosphere along through space is the force of gravity. It's also the reason why creatures can stand on a spacefaring ship without falling off the deck.

In Wildspace and on the Astral Plane, gravity is an accommodating force, in that the direction of its effect seems to be "that which is most convenient." For an object the size of a planet or moon, gravity pulls everything toward the center of the body, meaning that creatures can stand upright anywhere on the surface, and dropped objects fall perpendicular to the surface they land on.

For smaller objects, such as spacecraft, gravity doesn't radiate from a point but rather from a plane that cuts horizontally through the object and extends out as far as its air envelope. An obiect's gravity plane is two-directional: a creature can stand upright on the bottom of a ship's hull-upside down from the perspective of those elsewhere on the ship-and move around as easily as if it were walking on the top deck. Diagram 2.1 shows the location of the gravity plane of a nautiloid, by way of example, and indicates the directions in which its gravity operates.

One of the unusual properties of a gravity plane is that an object that falls off the side of a ship can end up oscillating back and forth across the gravity plane. It drops in one direction until it crosses the plane, then reverses direction back toward the plane again, continuing until something causes it to stop.

#### OVERLAPPING GRAVITY PLANES

When gravity planes intersect, such as when two ships pass close to each other and at different angles, the gravity planes of both ships remain in effect until the two ships touch one other (as often happens when they collide or when one ship lands on the other). If that happens, the gravity plane of the ship that has more hit points remaining (regardless of the ships' actual dimensions) overrides the other ship's gravity plane, suppressing it as long as the ships remain in contact, and the first ship's definition of "up" becomes the other ship's as well.

When a ship touches down on a planet (or some other enormous body), the ship's gravity plane is suppressed. If a ship has one or more decks on the ventral side of the ship's gravity plane (rather than its dorsal side), precautions must be taken before the ship lands to secure anyone and anything that might fall when the ship's gravity plane is suppressed.

#### TRACKING TIME IN WILDSPACE

Local time varies from world to world and from one Wildspace system to the next, depending on rotational periods, custom, and a host of other factors. Astral travelers often rely on what is considered the standard way of keeping time.

A standard day is 24 hours long. A standard week is seven standard days, and a standard month is four standard weeks (28 standard days).

The typical method for determining the length of a year-the amount of time that passes during a complete cycle of the seasons-has no meaning or usefulness for individuals who spend most of their time on the Astral Plane. For this reason, astral travelers avoid using years as a measurement of time.

#### DRIFTING

When a spelljamming ship moves in space, creatures and objects in its air envelope move with it, pulled along with the ship because of the strength of its gravity plane.

However, an unanchored creature or object floating in a ship's air envelope is weightless and drifts toward the edge of the air envelope at a speed of 10 feet per minute. For example, an unconscious sailor or a crate that falls off the deck of a spelljamming ship would begin drifting away from the ship along its gravity plane toward the edge of the ship's air envelope. When it exits the air envelope, the sailor or the crate would be left behind as the ship moves away from it.

#### FALLING

A floating creature that enters the air envelope of a larger body is immediately affected by the larger body's gravity (such as that of a planet) or gravity plane (such as that of a spelljamming ship). The creature falls from where it entered the air envelope to the surface of that body, or to the gravity plane of that body, whichever is nearer. Normal damage from the fall applies if the creature hits something solid at the end of the fall. A creature or an object that falls across a gravity plane takes no damage from the fall but begins oscillating from one side of the gravity plane to the other, as described above.

DIAGRAM 2.2: THE ASTRAL PLANE

# THE ASTRAL PLANE

Every world of the Material Plane is situated in Wildspace, or more precisely, in its own Wildspace system. Wildspace systems are airless oceans teeming with space-dwelling life forms, including spores, space plankton, and larger creatures that resemble fish and aquatic mammals. The ones that need air to survive either generate their own air envelopes or live in the air envelopes of other creatures.

Wildspace is where the Astral Plane overlaps with the Material Plane. Creatures and objects in Wildspace age normally and exist on both planes simultaneously. This overlap enables creatures to use spells such as teleport and teleportation circle to travel from Wildspace to a nearby world, or vice versa.

Diagram 2.2 illustrates how the Astral Sea surrounds all the Wildspace systems, as well as the astral dominions of gods and the floating remains of dead gods (see the "Astral Dominions and Dead Gods" sidebar). Many Wildspace systems have names; for example, Realmspace is a Wildspace system that contains, among other things, the planet Toril-home of the Forgotten Realms setting.

The following sections describe how astral travelers can get from one Wildspace system to another. as well as features of the Astral Plane that are likely to come into play.

#### CREATING A WILDSPACE SYSTEM

A typical Wildspace system has a sun plus a number of planets and moons orbiting it. Two examples of Wildspace systems. Doomspace and Xaryxispace. are described in the accompanying adventure, Light of Xaryxis. Use them as models when creating your own Wildspace system.

#### TRAVEL BETWEEN WORLDS

World-to-world travel requires a spelljamming ship, a teleport spell, or some other kind of magic.

Within a Wildspace system, the DM must decide how long it takes a spelljamming ship to travel from one world to another. This task is made easier if the DM has a diagram that shows how far away each world is from the center of the system (the diagrams of Doomspace and Xaryxispace in Light of Xaryxis serve as examples). Using such a diagram, you can calculate the shortest possible voyage (when the two worlds are as close to one another as possible) and longest possible voyage (when the two worlds are as far apart as they can be).

#### TRAVEL BETWEEN SYSTEMS

A creature or ship that wants to travel from one Wildspace system to another must cross the Astral Sea unless it has some other magical means of traveling from one world in the multiverse to another.

Wildspace systems aren't fixed in certain locations in the multiverse. Because they're constantly in motion, like corks bobbing in water, no reliable devices exist to help plot a course from one Wildspace system to another. Fortunately for travelers, the nature of the Astral Sea makes such journeys relatively easy, as discussed in the next section.

#### TRAVERSING THE ASTRAL SEA

The Astral Sea not only has gravity (see "Gravity Planes" above) but also breathable, comfortable air. But is the air real, or does this heavenly realm merely trick creatures into thinking they're breathing? In the Astral Sea, one can never be certain. All that really matters is that a creature can survive indefinitely in the Astral Sea, never aging and never feeling hunger or thirst.

#### TRAVEL BY THOUGHT ALONE

A creature doesn't need a vessel to travel through the Astral Sea. In this realm, a traveler has the option of propelling itself by thought alone. The more intelligent a creature is, the faster it can move. A creature that chooses to move in this fashion can move in any direction at a flying speed in feet equal to 5 × its Intelligence score.

#### ASTRAL SEA NAVIGATION

One doesn't need a map to navigate the Astral Sea. Here, all creatures are blessed with directional awareness. In other words, a creature can get to where it wants to go by thinking of its destination, at which point it becomes aware of the most direct route to that location. The destination must be somewhere in the Astral Sea or in Wildspace, such as "the nearest githyanki outpost," "the astral dominion of Hestavar," or "Realmspace." This directional awareness doesn't reveal how safe the route is, and the DM decides how far away the destination is and how perilous the trek through the Astral Sea is.

#### TEMPERATURE

The ambient temperature on the Astral Plane is about the same as on a moderate summer day in the temperate region of most worlds. Since there are no seasons in Wildspace or the Astral Sea, this temperature remains constant at all times. Some Wildspace systems, however, have significantly higher or lower temperatures. Krynnspace, for example, has a very low natural temperature (about 16 degrees Fahrenheit), and clouds of ice particles swirl in the

#### ASTRAL DOMINIONS AND DEAD GODS

Many gods have dominions in the Astral Sea. These locations typically take the form of floating islands or cities of fantastic proportions. Astral travelers might visit these dominions as they would any other ports of call, though a dominion's divine ruler always knows when visitors have arrived and what their intentions are. Because these dominions are part of the Astral Sea, they are timeless; nothing ages there, and creatures can survive there indefinitely without food or drink.

The Astral Sea is also where one can find the petrified remains of gods who were slain by more powerful entities or who lost all their mortal worshipers and perished as a result. A dead god looks like a gigantic, nondescript stone statue that bears little resemblance to the divine entity it once was. Githyanki, mind flayers, psurlons, and other natives of the Astral Plane sometimes turn these drifting hulks into outposts and cities, many of which are hollowed out beneath the surface.

vacuum within its boundaries. Of course, as one approaches a star that puts out heat, the ambient temperature increases.

#### ASTRAL FISHING

Fishing is a popular pastime in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, though this activity isn't possible aboard a ship that is moving faster than its flying speed (discussed later in this chapter). Wildspace settlements sell basic fishing equipment for 1 sp. For that, you get a pole, a line, a hook, and either a lure or some bait.

At the end of each hour spent fishing, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. A failed check indicates no fish is caught during that hour. On a successful check, roll a d10 and consult the Fishing table to determine the catch.

#### FISHING

#### d10 Catch

- Tiny, inedible fish (a creature that consumes it is 1-2 poisoned for 1 hour)
- 3-5 Tiny, edible fish (feeds one person)
- Small, edible fish (feeds up to four people) 6-8
- Hostile space eel (see Boo's Astral Menagerie; 9 feeds up to twelve people)
- 10 Hostile gray scavver (see Boo's Astral Menagerie; feeds up to twenty people), some other creature of the DM's choosing, or an Tiny object of the DM's choosing

#### WEIGHTLESSNESS

In any location where gravity isn't present, the following rules apply:

Impeded Melee. When making a melee attack with a weapon, a creature that doesn't have a flying or

AIR BUBBLE SPELL

swimming speed (either naturally or provided by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon deals piercing damage.

Movement. A creature can use an action to push off something heavier than itself and move up to its walking, flying, or swimming speed in a straight line. The creature continues along this course, moving in a straight line at its speed on each of its turns until something stops it or changes its trajectory.

# MAGIC

Magic functions on the Astral Plane as it does in most other D&D settings. The following sections present spells and magic items that are popular among astral travelers.

#### SPELLS

The Spells table shows which classes can cast the spells in this section and the levels of those spells. The table also notes the school of magic of

#### SPELLS

a spell and which classes have access to it. (The artificer class is presented in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.)

AIR BUBBLE 2nd-Level Conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Components: S Duration: 24 hours

You create a spectral globe around the head of a willing creature you can see within range. The globe is filled with fresh air that lasts until the spell ends. If the creature has more than one head, the globe of air appears around only one of its heads (which is all the creature needs to avoid suffocation. assuming that all its heads share the same respiratory system).

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create two additional globes of fresh air for each slot level above 2nd.

#### CREATE SPELLJAMMING HELM 5th-Level Transmutation

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a crystal rod worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes) Duration: Instantaneous

Holding the rod used in the casting of the spell, you touch a Large or smaller chair that is unoccupied. The rod disappears, and the chair is transformed into a spelljamming helm (see "Magic Items" below).

#### MAGIC ITEMS

This section describes magic items that are essential to travel and survival in Wildspace, as well as other items likely to be found on the Astral Plane.

#### FISH SUIT

#### Wondrous Item, Very Rare

This bulky suit, which fully encases your head and body, takes 1 minute to don or doff. While worn, it enables you to breathe in an airless environment and renders you immune to the harmful effects of any gas that surrounds you. The suit also grants you a swimming speed equal to your walking speed while underwater, or a flying speed equal to your walking speed in an environment with no gravity.

THREE EXAMPLES OF A SPELLJAMMING HELM

#### SPELLJAMMING HELM

Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)

The function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a ship on which it has been installed through space and air. It can also propel and maneuver a ship on water or underwater, provided the ship is built for such travel. The ship in question must weigh 1 ton or more.

The sensation of being attuned to a spelljamming helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as painful.

While attuned to a spelljamming helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as

#### COST OF A SPELLJAMMING HELM

A spelljamming helm propels and steers a ship much as sails, oars, and rudders work on a seafaring vessel, and a spelljamming helm is easy to create if one has the proper spell. Create spelljamming helm (described later in the chapter) has a material component cost of 5,000 gp, so that's the least one can pay to acquire a spelljamming helm.

Wildspace merchants, including dohwars and mercanes (both described in Boo's Astral Menagerie), typically sell a spelljamming helm for substantially more than it cost to make. How much more depends on the market, but 7,500 gp would be a reasonable demand. A desperate buyer in a seller's market might pay 10,000 gp or more.

you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):

- · You can use the spelljamming helm to move the ship through space, air, or water up to the ship's speed. If the ship is in space and no other objects weighing 1 ton or more are within 1 mile of it, you can use the spelljamming helm to move the vessel fast enough to travel 100 million miles in 24 hours.
- · You can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.
- · At any time, you can see and hear what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it.

Transfer Attunement. You can use an action to touch a willing spellcaster. That creature attunes to the spelljamming helm immediately, and your attunement to it ends.

#### WILDSPACE ORRERY Wondrous Item, Uncommon

Inside a Wildspace system, this portable arcane device automatically tracks the positions and movements of all suns, planets, moons, and comets within that system, projecting a display of all these bodies in the space above its current location. In that display, a white, pulsating pinprick of light marks the orrery's location.

WHILE USING AN ASTRAL PROJECTION SPELL TO TRAVERSE THE ASTRAL SEA, MORDENKAINEN THE WIZARD HAPPENS UPON A SPELLJAMMING SHIP

# SPELLIAMMING SHIPS

This section provides descriptions of various spelljamming vessels and rules that can be used when running encounters aboard them.

#### CREW

The standard crew complement for a spelljamming ship includes one captain to give orders, one spelljammer to pilot the ship, and one or more crew members to operate its weapons. Some ships carry extra crew (such as troops and back-up spelliammers) or passengers. A ship that has more than a standard crew complement will degrade the quality of its air supply more quickly.

A spellcaster typically charges at least 50 gp per day to operate a spelljamming helm.

#### SHIP-TO-SHIP COMBAT

The following rules are designed to make ship-toship combat simple yet exciting.

#### STARTING DISTANCE

At the start of an engagement, the DM decides how far a ship is from its enemies. Three possibilities are provided in the Starting Encounter Distance table. The shorter the distance, the less time crews have to load weapons and make other preparations.

#### STARTING ENCOUNTER DISTANCE

| Distance | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| 250 feet | Long range for ballistae, mangonels, short- |
|  | bows, longbows, light crossbows, and heavy |
|  | crossbows |
| 500 feet | Long range for longbows and mangonels; |
|  | beyond the range of ballistae and crossbows |
|  | 1,000 feet Beyond the range of most ranged weapons |

#### INITIATIVE

The Dungeon Master's Guide presents a variant rule called side initiative, which is ideal for ship-toship engagements, since it saves you the trouble of tracking initiative for individual creatures aboard each ship.

#### MOVING AND STEERING A SHIP

A spelljammer can use a ship's spelljamming helm to move and steer the ship without expending their own actions or movement. On their turn, the spelljammer determines how far the ship moves (up to its. maximum speed) and decides whether to approach another ship or put more distance between the two.

On its turn, a ship can be turned and reoriented so that all its weapons can aim and fire at any target within range, regardless of where they're situated on the deck.

#### BOARDING

When one ship moves to within 5 feet of another ship, the spelljammer or pilot of the moving ship can maneuver it alongside the other ship, enabling creatures to move safely from one ship's deck to the other ship's deck until one of the ships pulls away from the other.

A ship that has enough movement can pull alongside another vessel, deploy a boarding party, and then move away, provided the members of the boarding party took the Ready action to position themselves so they can move onto the other vessel when it's close enough.

#### CRASHING

A spelljammer can run their ship into another object or a creature by moving the ship into the target's space and making a special attack roll (1d20 + the spelljammer's proficiency bonus) against the target's Armor Class. If the attack roll hits, a crash occurs; otherwise, the target moves out of the ship's path, avoiding the crash. If the DM decides that a crash is unavoidable, no attack roll is necessary, and the crash occurs automatically.

When a spelljamming ship crashes into something that could reasonably damage it, both the ship and the creature or object it struck take bludgeoning damage based on the size of the struck object, as shown in the Crash Damage table. If the ship runs into something that doesn't have hit points (such as a planet or a moon), apply the damage only to the ship. The ship stops after crashing into a Gargantuan or immovable creature or object; otherwise, the ship can continue moving if it has any movement left, and whatever it struck moves to the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the ship's path.

After resolving the effect of the crash, determine whether the ship's gravity plane is suppressed (see "Overlapping Gravity Planes" earlier in the chapter). If the suppression of a ship's gravity plane would cause the creatures on or inside that ship to fall, they fall in whatever direction is appropriate for the sudden change in gravity. To determine the damage from a fall, see the falling rules in the Player's Handbook.

#### SHIPBOARD WEAPONS

A spelljamming ship typically has one or more shipboard weapons, ballistae and mangonels being the most common. Such weapons are slow to load and fire. Player characters are almost always better off using their own weapons and spells in ship-to-ship combat, reserving shipboard weapons for targets that are too far away to be damaged by other means.

#### CRASH DAMAGE

| Size of Creature or Object Struck | Bludgeoning Damage |
| --- | --- |
| Large | 4d10 |
| Huge | 8d10 |
| Gargantuan | 16d10 |

#### SHIP REPAIRS

Nonmagical repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage to a berthed ship takes 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labor. Damage to shipboard weapons can be repaired just as quickly (1 hit point per day), but at half the cost (10 gp per hit point).

The mending spell is a cheaper, less time-consuming way to make repairs. Casting mending on a damaged ship or shipboard weapon restores a number of hit points to the target equal to 1d8 plus the spellcaster's spellcasting ability modifier. The target can regain hit points from that spell no more than once per hour.

FISH SUIT

# BOMBARD

Bombards are built by giff. The major feature of each ship is an enormous cannon that fires massive cannon balls capable of blowing other ships to smithereens. (The cannon is included in the cost of the ship.) A bombard can carry up to fourteen giant cannon balls, each of which weighs 10 tons. These cannon balls make up most of the weight of the ship's cargo. A winch mounted on the aft deck is used to load the cannon balls on board.

A bombard can float and sail on water, but it can't land safely on the ground (its keel would cause it to roll on its side).

#### BOMBARD SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 15 (wood) | Cargo: 150 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 300 | Crew: 12 |
| Damage Threshold: 20 | Keel/Beam: 140 ft./30 ft. |
| Speed: fly 35 ft. (4 mph) | Cost: 50,000 gp |

#### 2 BALLISTAE (CREW: 3 EACH) Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 50 Cost: 50 gp (ballista), 5 gp (bolt)

It takes 1 action to load a ballista, 1 action to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

GIANT CANNON (CREW: 4) Armor Class: 19 Hit Points: 250 Cost: - (cannon), 1,000 gp (giant cannon ball)

It takes 3 actions to load the enormous cannon and 1 action to fire it.

Cannon Ball. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 600/2,400 ft., one target. Hit: 88 (16d10) bludgeoning damage.

This swift but cramped ship is made mostly of metal. It can't float on water, but its legs enable it to land safely on the ground. A sliding hatch just behind the wings allows access to the ship's mangonel turret. The ship's cargo hold can easily be turned into crew cabins or another weapon deck.

Damselfly ships are often used as courier vessels and armored transports. Explorers and pirates like them because they're fast and sturdy. Military leaders use them as command ships for the same reasons.

Damselfly ship owners are a proud lot, fond of painting their ships in colorful patterns as well as customizing their vessels with special equipment. Large, private gatherings of damselfly ship owners are not uncommon; they use these get-togethers to show off their ships and to race one another through asteroid belts and other obstacle courses, either for rewards or bragging rights.

# FLYING FISH SHIP

Aside from space galleons, flying fish ships are the most common vessels in Wildspace, favorites among merchants and adventurers alike.

A flying fish ship can float and sail on water, but it isn't built to land on the ground (the ventral fins would snap under the weight of the ship during landing, and the keel would cause the ship to roll to one side).

Typical weapons on a flying fish ship include a forward-mounted mangonel and an aftmounted ballista.

#### FLYING FISH SHIP SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 15 (wood) | Cargo: 13 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 250 | Crew: 10 |

# HAMMERHEAD SHIP

Hammerhead ships are popular craft, especially among pirates and merchants carrying heavy cargo. They can float on water and sail across it, but they aren't built to land on the ground (their keels would cause them to tip to one side). Standard weapons on a hammerhead ship include fore and aft mangonels, a ballista, and a reinforced bow for ramming.

#### HAMMERHEAD SHIP SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 15 (wood) | Cargo: 30 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 400 | Crew: 15 |
| Damage Threshold: 15 | Keel/Beam: 250 ft./25 ft. |
| Speed: fly 3 5 ft. (4 mph) | Cost: 40,000 gp |

#### BALLISTA (CREW: 3)

Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 50 Cost: 50 gp (ballista), 5 gp (bolt)

It takes 1 action to load the ballista, 1 action to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

BLUNT RAM Armor Class: -Hit Points: -Cost: - (included in ship cost)

The ship's spelljammer can make the following attack when the ship runs into another object or into a Gargantuan creature (see "Crashing" earlier in the chapter).

Blunt Ram. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 0 ft., one object or Gargantuan creature. Hit: 88 (16d10) bludgeoning damage. The hammerhead ship takes half as much damage and comes to a dead stop. Miss: The attack deals no damage, the target moves into the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the hammerhead ship's path, and the hammerhead ship can continue moving if it has any movement left.

#### 2 MANGONELS (CREW: 5 EACH)

Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 100 Cost: 100 gp (mangonel), - (stone)

It takes 2 actions to load a mangonel, 2 actions to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Mangonel Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 200/800 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it), one target. Hit: 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage.

# LAMPREY SHIP

Lamprey ships are antiquated, being among the oldest spelljamming ships still in use. Psurlons (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) are particularly fond of them.

Using the metal grappling jaws built into its bow, a lamprey ship can attach itself to another ship, which is a critical feature during boarding actions. Other standard weapons include four ballistae on the main deck.

A lamprey can float on water, though it can't land safely on the ground. Lamprey ships that land on the ground have the distressing habit of rolling over, as more than a few crews have discovered to their dismay.

#### LAMPREY SHIP SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 15 (wood) | Cargo: 6 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 250 | Crew: 15 |
| Damage Threshold: 15 | Keel/Beam: 115 ft./25 ft. |
| Speed: fly 3 5 ft. (4 mph) | Cost: 20,000 gp |

# 4 BALLISTAE (CREW: 3 EACH)

Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 50 Cost: 50 gp (ballista), 5 gp (bolt)

It takes 1 action to load a ballista, 1 action to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

#### GRAPPLING JAWS (CREW: 1)

Armor Class: -Hit Points: -Cost: - (included in ship cost)

It takes 1 action to make a Grappling Jaws attack.

Grappling Jaws. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one ship or Gargantuan creature. Hit: 22 (4d10) piercing damage, and the speed of the lamprey ship and the target become 0 until the grapple ends. As an action, a creature can use the grappling jaws' controls to release the target. Otherwise, the effect ends when the target or the lamprey ship drops to 0 hit points.

<sup>1</sup> Square = 5 Feet

# LIVING SHIP

Druids, rangers, and clerics devoted to gods of nature are often found aboard living ships, as are Wildspace explorers who don't want to have to worry about their ship's air envelope becoming fouled during a long voyage.

This ship's main distinctive feature is the fully grown treant on the aft deck. The treant has a speed of 0 because its roots are woven into the deck; it and the ship are inseparable. If the ship is reduced to 0 hit points, the treant dies of shock. The ship can function if its treant dies, but the treant can never be replaced with another.

When the treant finishes a long rest, it repairs the ship's hull, enabling the ship to regain 4d12 hit points, and refreshes the ship's air envelope (turning deadly air into foul air, or foul air into fresh air).

A living ship can float on water and sail across it, but it can't land safely on the ground (its keel would cause it to roll on its side). Its standard weaponry is an aft-mounted ballista.

#### LIVING SHIP SUMMARY

Armor Class: 15 (wood) Hit Points: 250 Damage Threshold: 15 Speed: fly 40 ft. (41/2 mph) Cargo: 10 tons Crew: 5 (plus the treant) Keel/Beam: 80 ft./20 ft. Cost: 25,000 gp

#### BALLISTA (CREW: 3)

Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 50 Cost: 50 gp (ballista), 5 gp (bolt)

It takes 1 action to load the ballista, 1 action to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

# NAUTILOID

Built and used by mind flayers, nautiloids are designed exclusively for space travel. They can't float on water, nor can they land safely on the ground.

As an action, a creature attuned to a nautiloid's spelljamming helm and in physical contact with the ship can transport the nautiloid and all creatures and objects aboard it to a different plane of existence, at or near a destination envisioned by the spelljammer (or to a random location on the plane if no destination is envisioned). This property is a feature of the ship, not the spelljamming helm. Each time this property is used, roll a d6. On a 5-6, the property recharges after 1 minute; otherwise, it can't be used again for 24 hours.

#### NAUTILOID SHIP SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 15 (wood) | Cargo: 17 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 400 | Crew: 20 |
| Damage Threshold: 15 | Keel/Beam: 180 ft./30 ft. |

It takes 1 action to load a ballista, 1 action to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

#### MANGONEL (CREW: 5) Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 100 Cost: 100 gp (mangonel), - (stone)

It takes 2 actions to load the mangonel, 2 actions to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Mangonel Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 200/800 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it), one target. Hit: 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage.

#### TENTACLES

Armor Class: -Hit Points: -Cost: - (included in ship cost)

As an action, the ship's spelljammer can make one of the following attacks with the ship's tentacles.

Grappling Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 30 ft., one Huge or Gargantuan target. Hit: 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage, and the nautiloid's speed becomes 0 until its spelljammer uses an action to release the target. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). If the target is another ship, the target's speed becomes 0 until the nautiloid releases it, or until the target or the nautiloid drops to 0 hit points.

Teleport. Melee Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. Hit: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space aboard the nautiloid that the nautiloid's spelljammer can see.

# NIGHTSPIDER

Neogi terrorize Wildspace in ships of their own construction, which others call nightspiders. These vessels often wait in ambush for other ships. Once a target ship is identified, the neogi try to steal its spelljamming helm and capture its crew.

A nightspider's crew usually consists of nineteen neogi and up to a half-dozen umber hulks, which the neogi use as shock troops.

Nightspiders are designed for space travel alone and can't float on water or land safely on the ground (the weight of the ship would snap its spindly legs, destroying its weblike rigging in the process). Standard weaponry on a nightspider includes four ballistae (two forward-facing and two aft-facing) and a forward-facing mangonel.

#### NIGHTSPIDER SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 19 (metal) | Cargo: 50 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 300 | Crew: 25 |
| Damage Threshold: 15 | Keel/Beam: 175 ft./50 ft. |
| Speed: fly 40 ft. (41/2 mph) | Cost: 50,000 gp |

#### 4 BALLISTAE (CREW: 3 EACH) Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 50 Cost: 50 gp (ballista), 5 gp (bolt)

It takes 1 action to load a ballista, 1 action to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

MANGONEL (CREW: 5) Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 100 Cost: 100 gp (mangonel), - (stone)

Mangonel Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 200/800 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it), one target. Hit: 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage.

# SCORPION SHIP

Scorpion ships are archaic metal warships that have never lost their popularity, largely because of their versatility. Articulated legs enable a scorpion ship to land safely on the ground and move across a solid surface at a walking speed of 30 feet. The ship can't float on water, however. A ballista is mounted on the top deck, and a mangonel is perched on the end of the tail. The ship's two claws are relatively inefficient in combat, but a claw that grabs a creature can quickly take it out of action.

#### SCORPION SHIP SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 19 (metal) | Cargo: 12 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 250 | Crew: 12 |
| Damage Threshold: 15 | Keel/Beam: 7 5 ft./25 ft. |
| Speed: 30 ft. (31/2 mph), | Cost: 25,000 gp |
| fly 30 ft. (31/2 mph) |  |

#### BALLISTA (CREW: 3)

Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 50 Cost: 50 gp (ballista), 5 gp (bolt)

It takes 1 action to make a Claw attack.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is also grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the creature takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns.

#### MANGONEL (CREW: 5)

Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 100 Cost: 100 gp (mangonel), - (stone)

It takes 2 actions to load the mangonel, 2 actions to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Mangonel Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 200/800 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it), one target. Hit: 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage.

# SHRIKE SHIP

This swift vessel is a relatively recent design, quickly gaining popularity with merchants and pirates. A shrike ship's legs enable it to land safely on the ground. The ship can float but isn't built for traveling on water and sinks quickly in rough seas.

Standard weaponry on a shrike ship includes three ballistae-one on the forecastle, one in the middle of the top deck, and one on the sterncastle. In a desperate situation, the ship's reinforced bow can be used as a piercing ram.

#### SHRIKE SHIP SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 15 (wood) | Cargo: 20 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 250 | Crew: 11 |
| Damage Threshold: 15 | Keel/Beam: 100 ft./20 ft. |
| Speed: fly 70 ft. (8 mph) | Cost: 20,000 gp |

Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

#### PIERCING RAM

Armor Class: -Hit Points: -Cost: - (included in ship cost)

The ship's spelljammer can make the following attack when the ship runs into another object or into a Gargantuan creature (see "Crashing" earlier in the chapter).

Piercing Ram. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 0 ft., one object or Gargantuan creature. Hit: 88 (16d10) piercing damage. The shrike ship takes half as much damage and comes to a dead stop. Miss: The attack deals no damage, the target moves into the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the shrike ship's path, and the shrike ship can continue moving if it has any movement left.

# SPACE GALLEON

The space galleon is a mainstay among the host of vessels that ply Wildspace and the Astral Sea. Space galleons can easily pass for ordinary seafaring galleons. Because they can land on water and move across it like their namesakes, they can sail into ports on terrestrial worlds without attracting undue attention. Like an ordinary galleon, a space galleon isn't built to land on the ground (its keel would cause it to roll on its side). The ship's standard weaponry includes two forward-mounted ballistae and an aft-mounted mangonel.

#### SPACE GALLEON SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 15 (wood) | Cargo: 20 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 400 | Crew: 20 |
| Damage Threshold: 15 | Keel/Beam: 130 ft./30 ft. |
| Speed: fly 3 5 ft. (4 mph) | Cost: 30,000 gp |

#### 2 BALLISTAE (CREW: 3 EACH) Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 50 Cost: 50 gp (ballista), 5 gp (bolt)

It takes 1 action to load a ballista, 1 action to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

It takes 2 actions to load the mangonel, 2 actions to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Mangonel Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 200/800 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it), one target. Hit: 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage.

# SQUID SHIP

Among the oldest types of spelljamming vessels, squid ships are popular with privateers and are often used as patrol ships. Standard weapons on a squid ship include a forward-mounted mangonel, two aft-mounted ballistae, and a reinforced bow for ramming. The tentacles that extend from the bow account for nearly half the ship's keel length.

Squid ships can float and sail on water, and they can land on the ground.

#### SQUID SHIP SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 15 (wood) | Cargo: 20 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 300 | Crew: 13 |
| Damage Threshold: 15 | Keel/Beam: 250 ft./25 ft. |
| Speed: fly 30 ft. (31/2 mph) | Cost: 25,000 gp |

#### PIERCING RAM Armor Class: -Hit Points: -Cost: - (included in ship cost)

The ship's spelljammer can make the following attack when the ship runs into another object or into a Gargantuan creature (see "Crashing" earlier in the chapter).

Piercing Ram. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 0 ft., one object or Gargantuan creature. Hit: 88 (16d10) piercing damage. The shrike ship takes half as much damage and comes to a dead stop. Miss: The attack deals no damage, the target moves into the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the shrike ship's path, and the shrike ship can continue moving if it has any movement left.

# STAR MOTH

Star moths are ships constructed and flown by astral elves, who don't like it when these ships end up in the hands of others.

A star moth's hull is fashioned from a grown and sculpted organic substance, and its enormous, decorative wings are made of shimmering crystal. The vessel is built for space travel, but its design does enable it to float on water or land safely on the ground. Standard weaponry includes two ballistae nestled in the star moth's eye holes and a mangonel mounted above the bridge.

#### STAR MOTH SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 13 (ceramic) | Cargo: 30 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 400 | Crew: 13 |

It takes 2 actions to load the mangonel, 2 actions to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Mangonel Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 200/800 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it), one target. Hit: 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage.

# TURTLE SHIP

A turtle ship is encased in a protective metal shell, as befits its name, and bristles with weapons. In addition to its roomy quarters, it can carry a decent-sized payload, making it popular among traders and others who need a lot of cargo space. The ship can land on the ground, and it floats on water. Sliding panels can be closed to make the hull airtight, enabling the ship to travel underwater safely, even to great depths. If the ship takes damage while on or under the water, interior hatches can be sealed to prevent the ship from flooding completely.

Standard weaponry on a turtle ship includes three forward-mounted ballistae and a rear-facing mangonel. These weapons can't be used while the ship is underwater.

#### TURTLE SHIP SUMMARY

Armor Class: 19 (metal) Hit Points: 300 Damage Threshold: 15 Speed: fly 25 ft. (3 mph), swim 25 ft. (3 mph)

Cargo: 30 tons Crew: 16 Keel/Beam: 95 ft./70 ft. Cost: 40,000 gp

#### 3 BALLISTAE (CREW: 3 EACH) Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 50 Cost: 50 gp (ballista), 5 gp (bolt)

Mangonel Stone. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 200/800 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it), one target. Hit: 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage.

# TYRANT SHIP

Beholders carve tyrant ships out of stone using their disintegration rays and use these ships to wander the Astral Plane, looking for worlds to conquer and rival beholders to destroy. No two tyrant ships look alike, but they all have one or more features reminiscent of their creators, such as a bulbous shape and eyestalks.

A spherical chamber on the ship's command deck functions as a spelljamming helm that only beholders can attune to. Any beholder that occupies this chamber can attune to it. Reducing a tyrant ship to 0 hit points not only destroys it but also destroys the ship's spelljamming helm and eyestalk cannons.

A tyrant ship can't float on water, but it can safely land on the ground.

#### TYRANT SHIP SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 17 (stone) | Cargo: 20 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 300 | Crew: 10 (beholders) |
| Damage Threshold: 20 | Keel/Beam: 100 ft./100 ft. |
| Speed: fly 40 ft. (41/2 mph) | Cost: - |

#### 3 EYESTALK CANNONS (CREW: 1 EACH) Armor Class: -Hit Points: -Cost: - (included in ship cost)

This weapon looks like an eye mounted on an eye-

stalk. A beholder stationed in one of the tyrant ship's meditation pods can see through the eye by concentrating on it (as if concentrating on a spell) and use an action to make the following attack.

Destructive Ray. Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (10d6) force damage.

# WASP SHIP

Wasp ships are lightweight wooden vessels capable of landing safely on the ground, but not on water. They appeal to adventurers because they're affordable and don't require a large crew. Pirates like them because they're swift. Aristocrats are fond of using them as flying yachts because the ship's cargo hold can be easily converted into posh living quarters.

The ship's raised back provides high ground for a weapon emplacement, which is typically equipped with a ballista.

# WASP SHIP SUMMARY

| Armor Class: 15 (wood) | Cargo: 10 tons |
| --- | --- |
| Hit Points: 250 | Crew: 5 |
| Damage Threshold: 15 | Keel/Beam: 80 ft./20 ft. |
| Speed: fly 50 ft. (51/2 mph) | Cost: 20,000 gp |

#### BALLISTA (CREW: 3) Armor Class: 15 Hit Points: 50 Cost: 50 gp (ballista), 5 gp (bolt)

It takes 1 action to load the ballista, 1 action to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

Bolt. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

THERE'S ONLY ONE RULE ON THE ROCK OF BRAL: LEAVE YOUR VENDETTAS AT THE DOCKS.

# CHAPTER 3 The Rock of Bral,

RAL IS A CITY BUILT ON AN ASTEROID. ITS inhabitants, who hail from many worlds, typically refer to Bral as the Rock. There is no other place quite like it in Wildspace. This chapter provides an overview of the asteroid city, which can serve as a hub for campaigns set in Wildspace. The accompanying poster map shows the topside and underside of the Rock of Bral, which are described later in this chapter.

# PAST AND PRESENT

The Rock traces its roots back to roughly 170 years ago, when the eponymous Captain Bral established a pirate refuge here. The asteroid became a haven for thieves and cutthroats, and among them a few merchants and entrepreneurs set up shop. Even in a climate of lawlessness, the place evolved into something resembling a settlement of citizens. After Captain Bral's death, the burgeoning city became known as Bral, in his honor, and its location as the Rock of Bral. For the next several decades, various pirate captains held sway in the city, but none of them demonstrated an interest in trying to take over sole leadership of the city.

Eventually, the merchants and tavernkeepers who made their livings on the Rock became as numerous as the pirates and brigands who sought refuge there. One of the pirate captains, Cozar, sensed that times were changing on the Rock-that the days of lawlessness were coming to an end. Through a series of strategic alliances and shrewd business deals, he consolidated his political power and dubbed himself Prince Cozar, the Rock's first overlord. Under Prince Cozar's long reign, the city evolved from a pirate hideout into a major city, attracting profit-seekers, adventurers, and other more respectable types.

Upon Cozar's death, the rule of Bral passed to Frun, his son and heir. Frun was far from an able politician. Rather, he was a hedonist whose overindulgences compromised his authority. Business leaders and other influential types grabbed power where they could, and by the end of his reign, Frun was little more than a figurehead. His only notable accomplishments were the renovation of the royal palace and the construction of the arena that bears his name.

Frun was succeeded by his son, Calar, whose bearing and tastes resembled those of his father but whose time as the overlord lasted only days.

Calar died six years ago under mysterious circumstances shortly after taking the throne; his body was found floating in space just beyond the asteroid's air envelope. Leadership of the Rock passed to Calar's younger brother, Andru, who had a group of malcontents arrested and executed for the crime within days.

Though his place on the throne is secure for now, Prince Andru is merely one player in a maze of political intrigue. He has a host of agents and forces loyal to him, but he must act with consideration, since he has opponents who would rather see Bral ruled by a more ineffectual leader or by a council that could more easily be influenced. Andru maintains his strong base of support because he is a serious and intelligent person-often likened to his grandfather, Prince Cozar, in this regard-and he isn't easily intimidated.

# LIFE ON THE ROCK

Bral is populated by an outlandish collection of traders, rogues, mercenaries, pirates, nobles, and entrepreneurs. Generally, law enforcement is sporadic, which means that order is an elusive concept. Most folks who call the Rock home adhere to two principles: mind your own business whenever possible, and enough gold can fix anything.

#### KEEPING ORDER

General lawlessness prevails in much of the city, but that's not to say that order doesn't exist. Simply put, most citizens police themselves. No city watch patrols the streets. Tavernkeepers hire muscular folks to break up fights and toss out drunkards. Market vendors trust their own eyes to spot shoplifters. Every person on the Rock is expected to have enough sense to hang onto their purse and not be taken in by a swindler.

Serious crimes, such as arson, can be reported to one of the city's three magistrates, who preside over the Low City, the Middle City, and the High City, respectively. If the magistrate concludes that the situation warrants their attention, the Magistrate's Watch is dispatched to investigate and take offenders into custody, if necessary. Most members of the Magistrate's Watch use the veteran stat block.

Reporting crimes is voluntary, and many folks don't bother to do so, since the resulting investigation and legal proceedings are likely to take up too much of their time.

# WHO'S WHO

Part of the trick to making the most of a visit to the Rock is knowing whom to approach and whom to avoid, so here's a helpful guide to who does what.

#### PRINCE ANDRU AND HIS COURT

The Bralian monarch is a slender, graceful man of 44 years. Self-serving and devious, he firmly believes that the end justifies the means. After secretly orchestrating the murder of his brother Calar, the previous monarch. Prince Andru consolidated his power and has held the throne in the years since.

Prince Andru surrounds himself with a small group of advisors, two of whom are described below.

#### PROCONSUL GADARIC MAIN

Gadaric is Andru's chief advisor. His appearance is that of the stereotypical elderly court wizard. He is hot-headed and a bit unreliable.

#### CAPTAIN MAHAXARA KHAL

Mahaxara, the current captain of the Royal Guard, is tall and athletic. She has snake tattoos adorning her arms. She is unflinchingly loyal to House Cozar, though she has no appetite for courtly politics.

#### UNDERBARONS

Four underbarons, each one equivalent to the master of a thieves' guild, compete among themselves for greater shares of influence and income in the city. Despite their status as lords of criminal fiefdoms, the underbarons enjoy the prince's tolerance. if only because each one's existence serves as a check against the others.

The businesses in any given area of the city operate under the protection of one of the underbarons. That service is paid for through the collection of "insurance" fees. The arrangement isn't strictly extortion, because it's common for an underbaron to reimburse clients who suffer losses because of a rival guild's actions.

The four current underbarons are as follows:

- Ozamata. This lawful evil human controls the docks and most of the Low City.
- Meredin Sandyfoot. This neutral good halfling, headquartered in a neighborhood known as the Burrows, holds sway over craftspeople.
- The Juggler. This chaotic good elf oversees a network of swindlers and minstrels. Her real name is Kiria Evensong, and she runs the Juggler's Folk Guildhouse (described later in the chapter).
- The Unknowable One. Within the cavernous interior of the Rock dwells a mysterious underbaron who specializes in smuggling. This underbaron-a mind flayer-breeds intellect devourers and uses them to turn Bralian citizens into spies.

# GETTING YOUR BEARINGS

The Rock of Bral is roughly 1 mile long and half that in width and depth, oriented front to back, with a leading edge and a trailing edge. A gravity plane bisects the length of the Rock, separating it into a topside and an underside.

The city of Bral is spread across the topside. On the trailing edge rises the High City, which includes the royal palace of Starhaven and its grounds, the noble estates, and Lake Bral. From there, the geography of Bral slopes down toward the Middle City, the financial and mercantile heart of the city. At the leading edge of the Rock is the Low City, an area populated by folk of modest means and the businesses they patronize. New arrivals at Bral typically disembark at the Low City's docks.

The underside of the Rock is off limits to the general population and not part of the city per se. It is where Bral's military forces are based. Most of the ground on the underside is used to grow crops to feed the populace. These fields are tended by convicted criminals who are housed in barracks and guarded by soldiers.

The interior of the Rock, which stretches half a mile from the surface of the topside to the surface of the underside, contains a network of caverns and tunnels. Built by pirates and smugglers, this dungeon is home to one of the city's underbarons (see "Underbarons" above) and is frequently used for clandestine meetings.

#### HIGH CITY

Rising above the rest of Bral on the trailing edge of the asteroid, the High City is a green, spacious expanse that holds Prince Andru's palace, called Starhaven, and various noble estates.

#### STARHAVEN

Standing at the highest point topside, Andru's palace of Starhaven crowns the Rock. Enclosed behind a wall, the seat of the ruling prince is a sprawling structure of gleaming domes and climbing vines.

The palace has many windows, all rendered shatterproof by magic. Attendants in impeccable livery see to the needs of the palace's occupants, while armored guards stand vigilant around the grounds.

#### LAKE BRAL

Lake Bral fills a chasm and provides most of the water that sustains Bral's population. The chasm extends through the gravity plane of the asteroid, so that Lake Bral has two surfaces-its topside surface and another in a cavern deep inside the Rock.

Although the lake means that a shortage of water isn't normally a concern on Bral, the water supply becomes depleted every few years. To replenish it, the Bralian navy embarks on an expedition to latch

ELMANDAR'S STAR CHARTS IS RUN ELE ADVENTURER WHO ONCE SERVED A SPELLJAMMER ABOARD A SPACE GALLEON CA THE ECLIPSE (SHOWN HERE AS A MODEL)

onto a nearby ice asteroid and bring it back. Before being brought into the Rock's gravity plane and lowered into the lake, the ice is broken up into manageable pieces.

A natural stone formation, called the Stonebridge, spans a narrow part of the lake.

#### FESTIVAL GROUNDS AND ARENA OF FRUN

The Festival Grounds is a broad parkland used for public gatherings on holidays and as a recreation spot at other times. Once a year, the Arena of Frun is the site of a series of athletic games, though it is seldom used for organized events otherwise.

#### LIBRARY OF THE SPHERES

The Library of the Spheres boasts a vast collection of tomes, scrolls, and other manuscripts. The library doesn't contain any books or scrolls of a magical nature, and none of its contents can be taken off the premises.

#### THE MAN-O'-WAR

For those feeling fancy or for whom fanciness is a way of life, the Man-o'-War, with its view overlooking Lake Bral, is the finest restaurant and inn in the city. The establishment has a strict dress code, and guests are not permitted to carry weapons.

Shrii Hallek, a respectful female hadozee, manages the Man-o'-War for its mysterious owners, who are rumored to be adventurers.

#### ROYAL THEATER COMPANY

The Royal Theater has been in operation for over sixty years. The company's lavish stage productions often feature magical illusions and pyrotechnical special effects.

#### TEMPLE DISTRICT

The temples in the Temple District are devoted to various gods, faiths, and pantheons. The priests here are willing to cast helpful spells in exchange for a donation in coins, gems, or art objects of a certain value, as noted in the Helpful Spells table.

#### HELPFUL SPELLS

| Spell | Donation |
| --- | --- |
| Commune | 1,000 gp |
| Legend lore | 1,500 gp |
| Lesser restoration | 150 gp |
| Raise dead | 2,000 gp |
| Remove curse | 250 gp |
| Scrying | 1,000 gp |

#### MIDDLE CITY

The financial and mercantile center of Bral, the Middle City is home to thousands of Bralians who can afford to live outside the Low City but don't have the privilege or means to dwell behind the walls of the High City.

#### THE DONJON

The Donjon is a walled fortification near the shore of Lake Bral where some offenders and malefactors against the crown are held. In addition to its role as an auxiliary barracks for the Royal Guard, the Donjon is where those judged too dangerous to serve sentences working the fields on the underside are imprisoned. The Warden of the Donjon is a plasmoid boss (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) named Ux.

#### THE EDGE

One of the largest and busiest taverns in Bral is the Edge, an establishment that's popular among space travelers visiting the Rock. A chatty, philosophical thri-kreen mystic (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) named Vikka tends bar.

#### ELMANDAR'S STAR CHARTS

Elmandar, a retired elf adventurer, is Bral's most accomplished astronomer. The star charts that he and his staff of cartographers create are highly sought after by navigators. These maps don't come cheap, each one priced between 300 and 800 gold pieces, but the owner of an Elmandar map can bring it back to the shop at any time for an update at no charge.

#### GASPAR'S RECLAMATIONS

Gaspar's Reclamations specializes in recovering magic items, gems, and works of art on behalf of its clients. The firm makes a living by charging a modest "finder's fee" for returning a lost item to its rightful owner. More important in the short term is the boost to its reputation that the business receives with every successful recovery.

#### GREAT MARKET

A chaotic expanse of small vendors, street performers, beggars, orators, merchants, and customers of all descriptions, the Great Market is the hub of the Middle City. During business hours, throngs of people swarm the area, and pickpockets dart among them to ply their own trade.

#### JUGGLER'S FOLK GUILDHOUSE

Operating behind the facade of a small backstreet playhouse, the guild of thieves known as the Juggler's Folk doubles as an acting company that puts on bawdy and crass comedies to maintain their ruse. The underbaron known as the Juggler operates out of the theater, occasionally performing before audiences unaware of her identity.

#### RED MASKS GUILDHOUSE

The Red Masks are a group of violent youngsters fighting for influence on the Rock. They frequently come into conflict with members of the Juggler's Folk. Fronted by a modest tavern, the Red Masks Guildhouse is located within a series of linked cellars beneath the streets. The tavern has no sign that bears its name, though a placard hanging over the door depicts a thrashing bull rendered crudely in red paint.

Most of the tavern's patrons don't suspect the establishment's true purpose. Those who are here on guild business need to be admitted to the Red Masks' secret sanctum before they are permitted to speak freely with the group's leaders.

#### MAGES' GUILDHALL

A sturdy three-story tower, the Mages' Guildhall is the headquarters and meeting place of the Mages' Guild of Bral. All arcane spellcasters in the city are entitled to join this loose federation, either as short-term guests or permanent, dues-paying members. The benefits of membership include access to hard-to-find spell components, the use of the guild's research facilities, and the prospect of professional discourse with others of a similar mind.

#### THE SINDIATH LINE

A gaudily decorated building tucked away in a cluster of residences is a branch office of the Sindiath Line, a charter service that ferries passengers from Bral to destinations throughout Wildspace, including other Wildspace systems. The captains who work for the Sindiath Line are capable and dependable.

#### THE SMITH'S COSTER

The largest and most successful merchant company based on the Rock is the Smith's Coster, which maintains a fleet of trading vessels and several warship escorts. The company specializes in trafficking weapons - for instance, providing iron blades to a community that lacks smithing in exchange for furs and other valuable merchandise, or making firearms available to a culture in which they were previously unknown.

#### VALKAN'S LEGION

The largest group of soldiers on the Rock, aside from the forces commanded by the prince, belongs to the mercenary company called Valkan's Legion. The organization maintains a building in the Middle City as a meeting place and mustering point for its members, who reside in their own homes when they're not on active duty.

Led by the renowned Valkan Riogan, who heads up many of the legion's larger operations personally, the company takes on missions on behalf of the

crown as well as hiring out squads of soldiers to rich individuals who need protection or security on a temporary basis.

#### LOW CITY

The beating heart of the Rock lies in the warren of streets and crowded markets of the Low City. It buzzes with activity at all hours, its streets choked with boisterous peddlers, clamorous beggars, and sneaky thieves.

The Low City has a preponderance of taverns, inns, alehouses, shops, and crafting establishments and an equally staggering number of vacant buildings.

#### DOCKS

Most ships approach Bral at the asteroid's leading edge, where a set of wooden docks extends into Wildspace to provide berths for new arrivals. Caverns at the gravity plane have been cut into the Rock's edge and turned into storage areas. Many of them are fitted with hoists used to transport cargo to the warehouses topside.

#### THE DRYDOCK

Referred to as the drydock, the shipyards, or simply the yards, this large, flat area along the leading edge is where ships are built and repaired.

#### THE HAPPY BEHOLDER

This prosperous tavern is owned and run by Large Luigi, a locally famous, lawful neutral beholder. Luigi has encyclopedic knowledge of all sorts of topics, and he's more than happy to share information with just about anybody. He is a civic-minded, well-liked citizen who has no political ambitions. His tavern is rarely troubled by bullies or thieves.

#### LESSER MARKET

The Low City's marketplace is much smaller and shabbier than the Great Market of the Middle City. Most of its structures are rickety stalls where small merchants peddle their wares. Though it draws its clientele mostly from the surrounding neighborhoods, the Lesser Market also attracts new arrivals, fresh from the docks, who are looking for a bargain or perhaps for something more sinister.

#### MERCANE AGENCY

Mercanes (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) recently established a presence on the Rock by taking over an unmarked, inconspicuous building near the Lesser Market. The place is occupied by a small staff of agents who act as an intermediary between the mercanes and those who want to do business with them. Such business typically involves the purchase of spelljamming helms and other magic items.

#### HISTORIC ENCLAVES

The Rock has several neighborhoods that started as enclaves for immigrants who arrived in large groups. Since then, many of these neighborhoods came to overlap as they merged into the roiling expanse of the Low City, though the name and a bit of the character of each remains. Three of these neighborhoods took root in areas immediately adjacent to the docks:

- The Burrows. This lively, friendly community of halflings stands ready to greet new arrivals to the Rock by offering fresh bread, cookies, flowers, charming gift baskets, and directions.
- Dwarven District. Many dwarf crafters live in this Middle City district, and their handiwork is second to none.
- Gifftown. Many of Bral's giff residents reside in or near Gifftown, gathering in taverns to swap stories of their accomplishments. Gunshots ring out from time to time as giff challenge one another to games of marksmanship.

The mercanes don't advertise their involvement with the facility, nor do they visit the agency very often. When they do, it's usually to conduct business with a particularly wealthy or influential client.

#### THE ROCKRAT

Of all the taverns on Bral, the Rockrat has the reputation of being the most dilapidated and filthy. Its only concession to decoration is a few hanging pieces of damaged nautical gear. Its owner and proprietor is a friendly, foul-mouthed wererat named Maya.

#### XENOTERMINATION, LTD.

This small group of highly capable combat specialists and spellcasters makes a living by hiring themselves out to capture or kill formidable Wildspace creatures. Typically, they are hired by an individual or a business whose welfare (financial or otherwise) is threatened by a monster that has defied less potent attempts to remove or subdue it.

From time to time, Xenotermination takes on temporary members, who are sought out because they have a particular talent. Anyone who wants to offer their services, on either a permanent or occasional basis, is welcome to visit the building where the present members of the group house themselves.

#### UNDERSIDE

The underside of the Rock is under the purview of the prince. No private citizens are allowed to reside here. The surface area is devoted mostly to fields that are planted and cultivated to replenish Bral's supplies of food and air. It also contains the headquarters and docks of the royal navy, barracks that house the prisoners who work the fields, and the army headquarters known as the Citadel, which overlooks the entire expanse.

The underside is under military control. Unauthorized visitors who get themselves apprehended are generally assumed to be either spies or prisoners trying to escape.

#### THE CITADEL

The well-defended fortress at the center of the underside is the command center and barracks for Bral's army. The Port Tower and the Starboard Tower are connected to the Citadel by narrow, covered walkways. Three passages branch off from each tower and end at smaller towers dispersed along the edges of the Rock. All these locations enable soldiers to maintain surveillance of the asteroid's immediate environs, and they are equipped with ballistae and mangonels to defend against an invasion.

#### FIELDS

The fruits, vegetables, and grains harvested from the fields on the underside keep the Rock's occupants well fed without the need for imported foodstuffs. The planting, cultivating, and harvesting of the produce are performed by convicts working off their sentences.

The work of the prisoners is loosely supervised by bands of army regulars.

#### NAVAL BASE

Along the leading edge of the underside is an array of docks where ships of the royal navy are berthed. At any time, at least two or three ships are actively stationed at the docks, prepared to depart at a moment's notice.

Just inland from the docks is a sprawling complex, the base proper, that includes a drydock area where most of the fleet is moored. The facility also contains barracks and mustering areas for captains and crews.

#### PRISONER BARRACKS

Convicts who have been sentenced to hard labor on the underside are housed in two rectangular, windowless buildings connected to the Citadel by narrow walkways. When they're not out working the fields, prisoners are kept behind locked doors in the barracks and left to their own devices.

#### THE VANES

The vanes, extending out from four towers on the trailing side of the asteroid, are enormous sails that can be moved to generate a disturbance in the Rock's air envelope, causing the Rock to rotate or turn in a certain direction if the need presents itself. If no other reason arises, the vanes are adjusted once every few months to ensure they're in good operating condition.

SHIP OF SPACE CLOW

## INTRODUCTION

# Creatures A to Zo

Take heart, fellow adventurers, for you have curried the favor of Boo!

-Minsc

*Squeak*

-Boo

OO IS A HAMSTER. MORE PRECISELY, HE IS a miniature giant space hamster-a rather famous one, in fact. Boo's adventures with Minsc the ranger, as well as his ferocity, are legendary. But Boo would be the first to tell you that he is just one of the countless amazing creatures that hail from the starry realm known as the Astral Plane.

Apparently, giant space hamsters aren't as bright or as legendary as their smaller cousins. Minsc has shared this information and a host of other pieces of lore from Boo freely and loudly during his travels. This book presents much of that lore, but don't expect commentary from the famous hamster himself. He's too busy saving the multiverse and, as Minsc might put it, "kicking butt for goodness."

# ASTRAL VARIANTS

If you want even more creatures to populate your adventures in space, look no further than the Monster Manual. Entities of the Outer Planes such as angels, devils, and slaadi are just as likely to be found on the Astral Plane as they are on any Material Plane world. The same can be said for aboleths, giants, mind flayers, umber hulks, vampires, and other Monster Manual creatures.

Practically any terrestrial creature can be turned into an astral-dwelling creature. whether it requires air or not. For example, a stone giant living on an asteroid might rely on the asteroid's air envelope for survival, or it might not need to breathe air. Similarly, a mimic stowing away aboard a spelljamming ship might be an ordinary specimen or one that has adapted to life in Wildspace.

You can turn any terrestrial creature into a Wildspace-dwelling variant by giving it the following trait, if nothing else:

Unusual Nature. The creature doesn't require air.

# USING A STAT BLOCK

This book is a companion to the Monster Manual and uses a similar presentation. If you are unfamiliar with the monster stat block format, read the introduction of the Monster Manual before proceeding further. That book explains stat block terminology and gives rules for various monster traits-information that isn't repeated here.

The Stat Blocks by Challenge Rating table sorts the creatures in this book by challenge rating.

#### UNUSUAL ATTACKS AND MAGIC

Some creatures have weapons that deal unusual damage types and spellcasting that functions in an atypical way. For example, many astral elves deal extra radiant damage with their weapon attacks. This extra damage isn't a feature of the weapon. Such an exception is a special feature of a stat block and represents how the creature uses its weapon or casts its spells; the exception has no effect on how a weapon or spell functions for a different creature.

#### MEETING MAGIC ITEM PREREQUISITES

If a stat block contains the name of a class in parentheses under the creature's name, the creature is considered a member of that class for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for magic items.

# ASTRAL ENCOUNTERS

You can generate a random encounter on the Astral Plane by rolling on either the Wildspace Encounters table or the Astral Sea Encounters table, as appropriate, or by choosing an encounter you like. If the encounter is with a spelljamming ship, you can roll on the Ship Encounters table to determine the ship and its crew, or you can create a ship encounter of your own (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide for ship descriptions).

Creatures marked with an asterisk (*) appear in this book; the rest are described in the Monster Manual. Any creature marked with a dagger (+) can serve as a spelljammer because it is a spellcaster.

If a Humanoid has no specified race, it can be of any race you choose.

#### INITIAL ATTITUDE

To randomly determine the initial attitude of the creatures encountered, make the attitude roll called for in an encounter table entry, then refer to the appropriate line of the Initial Attitude table.

#### INITIAL ATTITUDE

# AARTUKS

Aartuks are intelligent plant creatures that live to wage war. Beholders destroyed their original home world and scattered the survivors across the Material Plane. These survivors formed small nomadic cells.

Aartuk cells can be found throughout Wildspace, including aboard spelljamming ships whose former crews were either murdered or forcibly ejected by a band of aartuks.

An aartuk's body is shaped like a five-pointed star and is covered with thick, flexible bark. The tips of its branch-like extremities end in suction cups that allow the creature to climb on vertical surfaces and along ceilings. Each suction cup houses three retractable pseudopods that are used to manipulate small objects.

The head of an aartuk surmounts a 6-foot-tall stalk that can be extruded from the center of the star. The head contains the aartuk's sensory organs, including a long tongue that the creature uses as a weapon.

An aartuk continues to grow throughout its long life. Aartuk elders can be as large as 12 feet in diameter.

An aartuk's preferred method of attack is to shoot forth its gooey tongue and use it to drag enemies toward the center of its body so that it can batter them with its powerful branches. It can also spit pellets of radiant energy.

Aartuks have no deities of their own, but certain groups have adopted various gods of war and vengeance, including Gruumsh, Hextor, and Sargonnas.

The Aartuk language is made up of rustling sounds, snaps, pops, and hisses. It has no written form.

# ASTRAL ELVES

Long ago, some elves ventured to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. There, they ceased to age and could exist indefinitely without sustenance.

Astral elves were among the first creatures to dwell in the Silver Void. As other explorers have reached for the stars, astral elves have had to reckon with violent neighbors and strange visitors. Over the eons, astral elves have clashed with numerous invaders, including psurlons, mind flayers, and githyanki. When dealing with others, astral elves customarily cover their faces with ornate visors, becoming faceless extensions of their gods. Their fierce devotion to the pantheon of elven deities is repaid with divine power. For example, the gods invest astral elf warriors with the power to channel the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, just as they empower astral elf leaders with the ability to cast spells and summon solar dragons.

Astral elves ply the Astral Sea and Wildspace in ships of their own design. These ships are fashioned from crystals harvested from Wildspace systems and bound together with an organic, plant-based material that hardens like ceramic. The elves sculpt these substances in various configurations to create star moths (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) and other vessels. The elves also reshape the petrified

bodies of dead gods found adrift in the Silver Void, transforming them into floating cities and citadels.

Although the Silver Void is their home, astral elves often venture into Wildspace systems and place their ships and citadels in orbit around stars. Astral elves do this for several reasons. Proximity to a star allows the astral elves to forge pacts with solar dragons and to collect starlight, which the elves use to grow crystals and repair their ships. Most important, astral elves use their time outside the Deep Astral to replenish their numbers by having and raising children.

Many astral elves are thousands (in some cases tens of thousands) of years old. Whatever their disposition, their longevity gives astral elves a perspective on time that few other kinds of creatures can appreciate. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the far reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see events happening elsewhere as having little or no meaning to them.

#### ASTRAL ELVES OF XARYXIS

The adventure included in this product features an amoral astral elf society called the Xaryxian Empire. This empire is based in Xaryxispace, a Wildspace system illuminated by an enormous radiant sun named Xaryxis.

#### ASTRAL ELF ARISTOCRAT

An astral elf aristocrat is a brilliant, highborn leader gifted with magical abilities, including the power to channel sunlight and summon a solar dragon.

#### ASTRAL ELF COMMANDER

An astral elf commander leads warriors into battle and usually has one or more spelljamming ships under their command. A commander channels the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, and they can rescue warriors from a perilous situation by using their gods-given power of teleportation.

#### ASTRAL ELF HONOR GUARD

The safety of important individuals and locations is entrusted to astral elf honor guards, highly trained warriors who are more than capable of holding their own in combat.

#### ASTRAL ELF STAR PRIEST

Star priests draw their strength from the pantheon of elven gods and oversee religious practices in astral elf society. It's common for them to serve aboard spelljamming ships, not only as emissaries of the gods but also as spelljammers.

#### ASTRAL ELF WARRIOR

Astral elf warriors operate elven spelljamming ships and defend elven strongholds throughout the Astral Plane.

Morningstar. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d8) piercing damage plus 17 (5d6) radiant damage.

Rain of Radiance. Magical, flame-like radiance rains down on a creature that the elf can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Malfunction. Whenever the autognome takes 15 damage or more from a single source and isn't reduced to 0 hit points by that damage, roll a d20 to determine if it suffers a malfunction:

1-10: "All Fine Here!" No malfunction occurs.

# AUTOGNOME

An autognome is a mechanical gnome that resembles the rock gnome who created it, though it could never be mistaken for a gnome. Regardless of what its insides are made of, it has a metallic outer casing painted with gnomish features. It walks with a stiff gait, clanking, wheezing, whirring, and buzzing wherever it goes.

An autognome obeys its creator's commands when it is functioning properly, but a design flaw can cause an autognome to go rogue, forget its orders, and wander Wildspace doing anything except what it was designed for.

No two autognomes are necessarily made of the same materials; magic is what gives them their intelligence. Most autognomes are programmed to obey the following three directives: defend gnomes who are being attacked by non-gnomes, defend yourself if you are attacked, and protect infants and youngsters from harm. The last directive arose from the best intentions, but it doesn't distinguish between species; if an autognome sees a group of adults battling a lunar dragon wyrmling, for instance, it would come to the wyrmling's defense.

11-12: "My Mind Is Going. I Can Feel It." The autognome is incapacitated for 1 minute.

- 13-14: "You've Disarmed Me!" One of the autognome's arms falls off, reducing the number of Shocking Bolt attacks it can make by 1 until a creature uses an action to reattach the arm.
- 15-16: "Who Turned Out the Lights?" The autognome's head falls off and deactivates, causing the autognome to be blinded and deafened until a creature uses an action to reattach the head, which reactivates it.
- 17-20: "Have a Magical Day!" The autognome explodes and is destroyed. Each creature within 20 feet of the exploding autognome must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Unusual Nature. The autognome doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The autognome makes two Shock attacks.

Shock. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

# BRAXAT

A braxat is a towering, warm-blooded carnivore with a thick, articulated shell covering its back, a squarish head topped with horny protrusions, and thick arms ending in large hands with opposable thumbs. The creature walks upright on two legs and speaks in a voice similar to that of a human.

Braxats hunt alone or in pairs, prowling deserts, dry canyons, desolate wastelands, and lonely asteroids in search of prey. Braxats also spew acid, though they tend to do so only as a last resort, since the acid dissolves and ruins the flesh they crave.

A braxat projects an invisible psychic barrier around itself that enhances its natural armor, and it can amplify this magical energy to create shields of rippling force that deflect incoming attacks and absorb magic missile spells.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The braxat makes two Greatclub attacks.

Greatclub. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

Acid Breath (Recharge 6). The braxat exhales a 15-foot cone of acid. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 26 (4d12) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Spellcasting (Psionics). The braxat casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):

1/day each: compulsion, fear

#### REACTIONS

Psionic Shield (3/Day). When the braxat would be hit by an attack roll or a magic missile spell that originates from a source the braxat can see, the braxat can create an invisible barrier of magical force around itself that lasts until the start of its next turn. This barrier gives the braxat a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and prevents magic missile spells from damaging it.

# B'ROHG

B'rohgs are broad-shouldered, four-armed Giants, 15 feet tall, with burnt-orange skin. They have flat noses, pointed ears, and long hair that grows down the backs and sides of their otherwise bald heads. They wear simple garb and like to hurl heavy rocks. A b'rohg can wield a weapon with each of its four arms, but it prefers to pound enemies with its fists and rip smaller creatures apart with its bare hands.

B'rohgs communicate with one another using grunts and basic hand signals; they have no spoken or written language. They prefer to be left alone and for that reason don't normally pose a threat to smaller creatures. Because of their size and strength, they are popular attractions in gladiatorial arenas, where they are coerced into fighting for food.

B'rohgs are accustomed to eking out a meager existence in their natural habitat, and they rarely bond with other kinds of creatures. A b'rohg that benefits from a stranger's act of kindness is at first puzzled by the effort, then wary. If this kindness is sufficient to earn the creature's trust, the b'rohg will try to repay the stranger, perhaps by carrying their gear or helping them navigate perilous terrain. A solitary b'rohg that is befriended by a group of adventurers might follow them around for a while, but it will soon tire of their company and once again seek out others of its own kind.

Fist. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

Rock. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

Hideous Rend. The b'rohg uses all four of its hands to target one Large or smaller creature it can see within 10 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the b'rohg can't make Fist attacks or Rock attacks, and the target takes 49 (8d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is ripped into four pieces.

# CHWINGA

Chwingas are tiny elemental spirits that adapt easily to any habitable environment. These gentle creatures protect nature, considering themselves as its humble custodians. Chwingas live inside plants, rocks, and springs far from civilization.

Chwingas resemble 6-inch-tall, animated dolls with mask-like faces, spindly limbs, and wild hair. They don't have names and can't speak.

Chwingas normally avoid other creatures, but they find the trappings of civilization fascinating. They puzzle over creatures that wear armor, carry weapons, use tools, and cook food. When a chwinga encounters one or more such creatures, its curiosity compels it to shadow them for a short time and observe them. If it takes a liking to a particular creature, a chwinga uses its cantrips to aid that creature, or bestows upon it a magical gift before departing. The features that attract a chwinga to a particular creature vary. A chwinga might like the way a certain creature walks or the way it combs its hair, or be smitten by its ability to play music or to eat copious amounts of food.

#### CHWINGA ASTRONAUTS

Chwingas that live in Wildspace usually dwell on habitable moons and asteroids, though they occasionally stow away on spelljamming ships or ride around on space guppies (described later in this book). Using its Magical Gift ability, a chwinga astronaut can bestow one of the following charms in place of those described in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Evasion. When the chwinga is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails, provided it isn't incapacitated.

Unusual Nature. The chwinga doesn't require air, food, or drink. When it dies, it turns into a tiny pile of moondust, a A CHWINGA ASTRONAUT RIDES A SPACE GUPPY.

#### CHARM OF AIR BUBBLES

This charm allows you to cast the air bubble spell (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) as an action. Once used three times, this charm goes away.

#### CHARM OF INSTANT TOOLS

This charm allows you to magically conjure a set of artisan's tools, navigator's tools, or thieves' tools. The conjured tools appear either in your hand or somewhere else in your space (your choice). Once used, this charm goes away, but the tools remain.

cloud of glittering spores, a statuette resembling its former self, a chunk of ice, or a sponge shaped like a dodecahedron (DM's choice).

#### ACTIONS

Magical Gift (1/Day). The chwinga targets a Humanoid it can see within 5 feet of itself. The target gains a supernatural charm of the DM's choice. See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information on supernatural charms.

Natural Shelter. The chwinga takes shelter inside a rock, a bush, a tree, or a natural source of fresh water in its space. The chwinga can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect while it is magically protected in this way, and the shelter doesn't impair the chwinga's blindsight. The chwinga can use its action to emerge from a shelter. If its shelter is destroyed, the chwinga is forced out and appears in the shelter's space, but is otherwise unharmed.

Spellcasting. The chwinga casts one of the following spells, requiring no material or verbal components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability:

At will: druidcraft, guidance, pass without trace, resistance

Unusual Nature. The horror doesn't require air.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The horror makes one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d6 + 8) piercing damage.

# COSMIC HORROR

Cosmic horrors are colossal, malevolent entities that occasionally slip the bonds of the Far Realm and find themselves adrift on the Astral Plane. Drawn to the light of distant stars, these creatures invade Wildspace systems and lay waste to worlds. After feeding on the minds and bodies of a world's inhabitants until it is sated, a cosmic horror usually returns to the void, where it falls into a deep sleep, drifting aimlessly until hunger or some other stimulus awakens it.

Cosmic horrors are among the most powerful creatures spawned by the Far Realm. No two of them have the same appearance, but they have certain qualities in common. Each one is roughly 100 feet long or tall, and its physical form is a seemingly impossible conglomeration of eyes, mouths, wings, tentacles, and less recognizable organs and appendages.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d6 + 8) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the horror can't use this tentacle against other targets. The horror has 1d8 + 1 tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

Psychic Whispers (Recharge 5-6). The horror emits dreadful whispers in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in the sphere that isn't an Aberration must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The horror can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The horror regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

- Crushing Tentacle. The horror crushes one creature it is grappling. The grappled creature must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (3d6 + 8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- Poison Jet (Costs 2 Actions). Foul gas squirts from the horror in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) poison damage.
- Teleport (Costs 2 Actions). The horror teleports, along with any creatures it is grappling, to an unoccupied space it can see within 120 feet of itself.

# DOHWAR

Dohwars are short, pudgy, flightless avians that look and move like penguins. They are inveterate merchants, always looking for an opportunity to turn a profit. Dohwars conduct their dealings in secrecy, preferring to do business in dark alleys and out-ofthe-way places even when the items being bought or sold aren't illegal or dangerous. They tend to dress in a garish mishmash of clothing, but many of them also shroud themselves in hooded cloaks. A group of dohwars is called a cartel.

The average dohwar stands 3 feet tall and has bright plumage. Instead of wings, it has arms and tiny hands.

Dohwars prefer to communicate through a form of telepathy they call merging, in which two dohwars stay in mental contact while both are telepathically linked with a third creature.

Dohwars have their own pantheon of deities, made up entirely of gods of commerce and wealth. These deities include Waukeen, Abbathor, and Zilchus. By focusing on the worship of such deities, the dohwars hope to become the best merchants in the multiverse without alienating or offending any god in particular.

Bioluminescence. While it has at least 1 hit point, the esthetic sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and its interior compartments are dimly lit.

Spelljamming. The esthetic has the properties of a spelljamming helm (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide), but only its reigar creator can attune to it.

# ESTHETIC

An esthetic is a biological, symbiotic creation of a reigar (see "Reigar" later in this book). It is essentially an organic ship with only the barest hint of awareness. Without its reigar to guide it, an esthetic becomes a nearly mindless entity with an instinct for self-preservation.

Reigar use their esthetics as spelljamming warships. When a hostile reigar in its esthetic encounters another spacefaring vessel, it uses a magical vibration to disable the ship's spelljamming helm. The reigar then commands the esthetic to grapple members of the ship's crew and dissolve their flesh with its acid-secreting tentacles.

Each esthetic is unique in appearance. One might be bilaterally symmetrical (two matching halves, like a humanoid body along its vertical axis), radially symmetrical (like a starfish), or have no definable shape. From a distance, an esthetic is easily mistaken for a giant, space-dwelling jellyfish or cephalopod. Its outer shell is made of bioluminescent resin.

An esthetic contains enough interior space to comfortably accommodate its reigar host and up to six Medium passengers. Access is gained through a hatch that the reigar (and no one else) can open or close with a touch.

An esthetic can survive indefinitely on the Astral Plane, provided its creator is alive. If the esthetic's creator dies, the esthetic sickens over a period of 1d12 days and then expires.

Unusual Nature. The esthetic doesn't require air, food, or drink.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The esthetic makes two Tentacle attacks.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d6 + 7) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the creature takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the start of each of its turns, and the esthetic can't use this tentacle against other targets. The esthetic has 1d4 x 2 tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

#### BONUS ACTIONS

Jammerscream (Recharge 6). The esthetic targets one spelljamming ship within 300 feet of itself, magically suppressing the properties of the ship's spelljamming helm for 2d10 days. If the ship has more than one helm aboard it, randomly determine which helm is affected. A creature attuned to that helm can choose to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 42 (12d6) psychic damage, and the helm is suppressed for 2d10 hours instead of 2d10 days. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and the helm is suppressed for 2d10 minutes instead of 2d10 days.

# EYE MONGER

When its large eye and mouth are closed, an eye monger looks like nothing more than a 12-foot-diameter asteroid. When it senses vibrations in the space around it, the eye monger opens its eye and reveals its true, menacing nature.

An eye monger has no use for treasure, but its belly might hold a fair amount of incidental

Antimagic Gullet. Magical effects, including those produced by spells and magic items but excluding those created by artifacts or deities, are suppressed inside the eye monger's gullet. Any spell slot or charge expended by a creature in the gullet to cast a spell or activate a property of a magic item is wasted. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. No spell or magical effect that originates outside the eye monger's gullet, except one created by an artifact or a deity, can affect a creature or an object inside the gullet.

valuables that it can't digest, including coins, metal weapons, gemstones, and magic items that belonged to the creatures it swallowed.

Although an eye monger doesn't project an antimagic cone from its eye as a beholder does, magic is suppressed inside its gullet, which prevents a swallowed creature from using magic to escape.

False Appearance. If the eye monger is motionless and has its eye and mouth closed at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the eye monger move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the eye monger is animate.

Unusual Nature. The eye monger doesn't require air.

#### ACTIONS

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the eye monger and deposited in the eye monger's gullet (see Antimagic Gullet). The eye monger can swallow one creature at a time. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside the eye monger, and takes 35 (10d6) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.

If the eye monger takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside its gullet, the eye monger regurgitates the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10. feet of the eye monger. If the eye monger dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.

# FEYR

A feyr (pronounced "fear") is a tentacled horror that feeds quietly on strong emotions. To minimize the chance of harm to itself, it prefers to devour the nightmares of other creatures while they sleep.

Feyrs shun bright light but aren't harmed by it. Consequently, they are as much at home in the void

of Wildspace as they are in dark alleys and dungeons. A feyr that comes across a spelljamming ship tries to enter the ship's air envelope and stow away, remaining secluded and invisible until it finds a sleeping victim it can attack. It retreats rather than allows itself to perish in a confrontation.

Frightful Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage, and each creature within 10 feet of the feyr that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the feyr until the end of the feyr's next turn.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) psychic damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the feyr can't use this tentacle against other targets. The feyr has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one creature.

Invisibility. The feyr becomes invisible until it attacks, uses Nightmare Fuel, or uses a bonus action to become visible.

Nightmare Fuel (1/Day). The feyr targets one unconscious creature it can see within 10 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or take 27 (5d10) psychic damage, and the feyr gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

# GAT

Gaj are hideous hunters that prey on other intelligent life forms. They crawl on six insectile legs and attack with their mandibles. They ambush prey by burying themselves under sand or silt and lying in wait, lurking in dark caves, or perching on natural stone ledges, where they blend in with their surroundings. Gaj have no language, but they have the magical ability to understand the speech of other creatures.

A gaj's head is a spongy globe about 2 feet in diameter, with three feathery antennae protruding from the top. Spaced around the head are six compound eyes, and six finger-like appendages hang over its mouth. A gaj can try to read the thoughts of another intelligent creature by wrapping its antennae around the creature's head. Regardless of whether the attempt succeeds, this mental probe is painful and takes a toll on the victim's well-being.

On a failed save, the target takes 16 (3d10) psychic damage, and the gaj magically pulls one piece of information from the target's mind that the gaj wants to know. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the gaj learns nothing.

Paralyze (Recharge 6). The gaj magically targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

# GIFF

It's easy to spot giff in a room: these burly folk are 7-foot-tall, hippopotamus-headed people. In Wildspace and its associated ports, giff are most often encountered as spacefaring mercenaries. These troops are renowned for their martial training and love of explosives and are typically armed with gleaming firearms.

Every aspect of these spacefaring giff's society is organized along military lines. From birth until death, each has a military rank. Promotions don't depend on time in service but are granted by superiors as rewards for valor.

Muskets and grenades are the specialties of many giff regiments. The bigger the boom, the brighter the flash, and the thicker the smoke it produces, the greater the glory for the one wielding the weapon.

#### GIFF SHIPMATE

Giff shipmates, who make up the bulk of the crew on most giff vessels, are disciplined sailors.

#### GIFF SHOCK TROOPER

A giff shock trooper is trained to mount assaults on enemy strongholds. Each one is adept at softening up the enemy from a distance with firearms before charging into melee to mop up the foes that remain standing.

#### GIFF WARLORD

A high-ranking giff who takes up the life of an independent mercenary might amass enough power and influence to become a warlord.

A giff warlord usually commands a small fleet of spelljamming ships and operates out of a heavily defended stronghold. Anyone who shares the warlord's ideology-whatever it might be-is eligible to join the ranks of the warlord's army, which is mainly made up of mages who helm the ships of the fleet and provide magical firepower, sellswords of various species, and guns for hire in the form of giff shock troopers.

LEFT TO RIGHT: GITHYANKI STAR SEER, GITHYANKI XENOMANCER. AND GITHYANKI BUCCANEER

# GITHYANKI

Githyanki descend from an ancient people who were also the progenitors of githzerai. These tall, gaunt folk have potent psionic powers and dwell, for the most part, on the Astral Plane. Among the best-known githyanki are the followers of the Lich-Queen Vlaakith. They terrorize the Astral Plane, raiding into Wildspace to plunder the multiverse of its magic and riches.

The Monster Manual and Monsters of the Multiverse contain a variety of githyanki for your use. This section provides additional options.

#### GITHYANKI BUCCANEER

Githyanki buccaneers ply the Astral Plane for riches, which they haul back to their hidden fortresses in the Deep Astral. Many of them are warriors who lost the will to serve the Lich-Queen Vlaakith; they prefer to live by their own code or revel in their unbridled freedom.

#### GITHYANKI STAR SEER

Githvanki star seers believe that the stars are the eyes of the multiverse. They use their magic to contact ancient stellar entities such as Acamar,

Caiphon, and Hadar, hoping to learn their secrets, then record these secrets in iournals. They scour Wildspace in search of new entities as well, hoping to be the first to contact them.

Some of the secrets learned are so cryptic that they require years of research to decipher, but time is of little concern to a star seer, who resides mainly on the Astral Plane.

#### GITHYANKI XENOMANCER

A githyanki xenomancer travels to the farthest reaches of Wildspace and the Astral Sea, even visiting worlds of the Material Plane from time to time, to study and catalog creatures it has never encountered before. Friendly contact with sapient creatures can bring the xenomancer's diplomatic skills to the forefront, while hostile contact becomes a test of the xenomancer's survival skills.

Sometimes a xenomancer's research requires that a specimen be captured and imprisoned (to study its behavior) or killed and dissected (to study or harvest its insides). Many xenomancers prefer to do this work in their laboratories on the Astral Plane.

# HADOZEES

Hadozees are slender, highly adaptive Humanoids with simian features and their own language. Their feet are fully as dexterous as their hands, even to the extent of having toes that serve as opposable thumbs. Membranes of skin hang loosely from their arms and legs. When stretched taut between outstretched limbs, these membranes enable a hadozee to glide.

On Yazir, their home world, hadozees lived high up in the trees to avoid large predators that walk on land. Today, Wildspace is where most of them feel at home. Hadozees are often hired as mercenary crews by other spacefaring folk. Their natural climbing ability comes in handy, as does their ability to glide. A hadozee accustomed to space travel knows how to use a ship's gravity plane to its advantage in combat, by diving off one side of the ship, gliding under the keel, and appearing on the opposite side of the ship from where it leapt off.

#### HADOZEE EXPLORER

Hadozee explorers scour Wildspace systems for riches and adventure. They often serve as navigators aboard spelljamming ships. To them, the Astral Plane is a mostly uncharted expanse worthy of further exploration.

#### HADOZEE SHIPMATE

Hadozee shipmates make up much of the crew aboard some spelljamming ships.

#### HADOZEE WARRIOR

Hadozee warriors make their living as mercenaries, sometimes in the company of pirates. Squads of warriors often adopt colorful names, such as the Soaring Hadozees, the Jammin' Wingbats, and the Night Howlers.

Spelljammer Overload. If the leech is reduced to 0 hit points while attached to a ship that has a spelljamming helm, the creature attuned to that helm must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (4d4) psychic damage and is incapacitated for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

Unusual Nature. The leech doesn't require air or sleep.

# JAMMER LEECH

A jammer leech is a barnacle-like creature that begins life as a space-dwelling spore that attaches to the hull of a spelljamming ship, with the leech inside in larval form. A spore that remains attached to a ship for a few days punctures the hull and begins to develop a hard shell that roughly matches the color of the hull. The shell is affixed to the ship by a glue-like substance secreted by the leech. The shell grows until it's about 1 foot in diameter. The leech inside is reddish-purple in color, with a body resembling that of a snail. It has a single watery eye at one end and a spiked tentacle protruding from just below the eye, which it uses to defend itself.

A mated pair of leeches produces 1d6 spores every month. Some of these spores might join their parents on the hull of the ship, while others float off, waiting to attach themselves to another unwary vessel.

A jammer leech damages the hull of the ship to which it is attached and absorbs magic from the ship's spelljamming helm. It can discharge this magic from time to time as a defensive measure. If the crew of a ship becomes aware of leeches that have become attached, it's customary for them to try to scrape the leeches off the hull rather than attack them with weapons. Killing a leech while it is attached to the ship is dangerous, because the trauma of its death can be felt by the ship's spelljammer, who is weakened and incapacitated by the shock.

#### ACTIONS

Spiked Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) piercing damage.

#### BONUS ACTIONS

Attach to Hull. The leech attaches itself to a ship's hull in its space, dealing 2 (1d4) piercing damage to the ship (ignoring the ship's damage threshold). This damage can't be repaired until the leech is scraped off the hull. While the leech is attached, its speed is 0, and it can detach itself as a bonus action. As an action, a creature within reach of the leech can to try to scrape it off the hull, doing so with a successful DC 18 Strength check. On a failed check, the action is wasted as the leech remains attached to the hull. Removing the leech in this way deals no damage to the leech or the ship.

#### REACTIONS

Magical Discharge (1/Day). When it takes damage, the leech can discharge a bolt of magical energy from its eye that targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) force damage and be stunned until the end of its next turn.

Kindori are among the largest creatures found in Wildspace. They resemble aquatic whales in general shape and are mammals as well. An adult specimen can be up to 80 feet long.

A kindori lacks a noticeable mouth. The leading edge of its body is dotted with small eyes that can emit bright beams of light, which the creature uses to blind predators before making its escape. Kindori communicate with one another over long distances by sending flashes of light from their eyes and draw their nourishment from the light of suns and stars.

A kindori is large enough to have its own gravity plane and air envelope, enabling smaller creatures to live and travel on its body. Mosses, molds, and other parasitic organisms grow on its surface, which in turn attract predators to clean them off. A kindori might have scavvers feeding on these parasites, which it doesn't mind. An extremely old or sick kindori can be identified by the overgrowth of vines and vegetation on it.

The bones and cartilage of a dead kindori do not deteriorate after parasites devour the creature's flesh. A kindori skeleton can be transformed into a spelljamming ship by placing a spelljamming helm inside it.

Kindori are peaceful creatures but have many natural enemies, including lunar dragons, solar dragons, and various peoples that inhabit Wildspace.

# LUNAR DRAGONS

Lunar dragons (also known as moon dragons or phase dragons) are capricious, xenophobic creatures that make their lairs inside desolate moons by burrowing through the rock.

Before laving eggs, a female lunar dragon stocks her lair with food; she won't leave the lair again until the eggs hatch and the offspring are old enough to fend for themselves. Lunar dragon eggs have stony shells that are pale white to light gray in color. Lunar dragons are alabaster white when they hatch and gradually turn darker as they age. Ancient moon dragons are the color of slate.

Lunar dragons enjoy depriving other creatures of treasure more than acquiring the treasure themselves. Often found among the treasures in a lunar dragon's hoard are one or more spelljamming helms (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) taken from vessels that dared to invade the dragon's territory.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.

A lunar dragon can become incorporeal, but not to the extent that it can pass through other creatures or solid objects. In this semi-incorporeal state, roughly half of the dragon's body has a dark, indistinctly spectral form.

#### A LUNAR DRAGON'S LAIR

The cave complex where a lunar dragon makes its lair contains ample space for food, as well as one or more hidden chambers where the dragon keeps its treasure. Depending on the composition and features of the moon, the lair might contain natural springs and heat vents, wild gardens, crystal formations, magical phenomena, or an ecosystem of lesser life forms that have adapted to living with the dragon.

Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6). The dragon exhales a blast of frost in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 36 (8d8) cold damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced.

#### BONUS ACTIONS

Phase (3/Day). The dragon becomes partially incorporeal for as long as it maintains concentration on the effect (as if concentrating on a spell). While partially incorporeal, the dragon has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

#### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Tail Attack. The dragon makes one Tail attack.

Treacherous Ice. Magical ice covers the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of itself. The ice, which is difficult terrain for all creatures except lunar dragons, lasts for 10 minutes or until the dragon uses this legendary action again.

Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 12 (1d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

#### REGIONAL EFFECTS

The region containing an ancient or adult lunar dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which produces one or more of the following effects:

- Black Frost. A thin layer of black frost covers the ground, which kills all ordinary plants growing within 6 miles of the lair if the dragon is ancient, or within 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.
- Haunting Moan. A haunting sound gets louder or fainter (dragon's choice) the closer one gets to the lair. The moan is audible 6 miles from the lair if the dragon is ancient, or 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.

# MEGAPEDE

Megapedes are enormous centipedes that can be as much as 150 feet long, though most specimens top out at between 100 and 120 feet. Their dozens of legs are each 5 feet long and tipped with flexible claws, and they have fur-covered carapaces. A megapede that lives in a sandy environment often buries itself in the sand and waits for prey to wander nearby, but megapedes also nest in cavernous underground chambers.

After a megapede lays eggs, it attaches the eggs to its body using sticky saliva and carries them on its back until the eggs hatch. Newly hatched megapedes grow to full size within weeks by consuming as much as they can, possibly including one another if food is scarce.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 22 (5d8) poison damage.

Life Drain. The megapede magically drains life energy from other creatures nearby. Each creature within 15 feet of the megapede must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

# MERCANE

Mercanes are merchants who trade primarily in magic items and advanced technology, including artifacts and spelljamming helms. These 12-foottall, lanky, blue giants dress in elegant robes and have elongated heads and long, spindly fingers. They use spelljamming ships to cross the Astral Sea and travel from world to world within Wildspace systems, where they conduct most of their business. It's rare to see more than one mercane at a time, though it's common for a mercane to be accompanied by underlings or bodyguards.

Mercanes will conduct business with anyone, fairly and reliably, provided the other party has neither harmed nor swindled another mercane in the past. Mercanes have a special form of telepathy that enables them to communicate with one another across the multiverse. A mercane often uses this ability to warn another mercanes about individuals who are dangerous or unreliable. Once a mercane has been offended by someone, getting back into their good graces is next to impossible.

# MURDER COMET

Evil spellcasters create murder comets by combining the essence of earth elementals with that of fire elementals. A murder comet looks like a screaming stone head wreathed in flame. It trails fire behind it as it flies through Wildspace, either singly or in a posse with other murder comets, looking for ships, crews, and other unsuspecting targets to destroy.

A murder comet's creator can bind their spirit to the comet. In this form, the comet's creator becomes

# NEH-THALGGU

Known throughout the multiverse as brain collectors, neh-thalggu consume the brains of Humanoids and use them as receptacles to enhance their magical abilities.

Neh-thalggu are born in the nightmarish Far Realm, but they spread across the Astral Plane and find their way onto the various worlds of the Material Plane, where brains are much more abundant. A neh-thalggu has a bulbous body and six legs resembling those of a crustacean. Four bulging eyes and a tooth-filled maw dominate its hideous visage. Behind and above these features, one or more lumps protrude from its body, each one containing a brain the neh-thalggu has consumed.

After a neh-thalggu kills a victim, it uses its pincers to cut open the victim's head and remove the brain. It then swallows the brain whole. The collected brain is stored inside one of several pockets in the neh-thalggu's head. Once it has collected twelve brains in this fashion, it is overcome by an urge to return to the Far Realm and begins devoting all its energy to finding a way home.

In an encounter with a neh-thalggu, roll a d12 to determine how many brains it has already collected.

# NEOGI

A neogi looks like an outsize spider with an eel's neck and head. It can poison the body and the mind of its targets and can subjugate even beings that are physically superior.

Neogi usually dwell in far-flung locations on the Material Plane, as well as on the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane. They left their home world long ago to conquer and devour creatures in other realms. During this era. they dominated umber hulks and used them to build sleek, spidery ships capable of traversing the multiverse.

#### NEOGI HATCHLING SWARM

A neogi lives about a century. When an individual is rendered weak by advanced age, the other neogi in the group overpower it and inject it with a special poison. The toxin transforms the old neogi into a bloated mass of flesh. Younger neogi lay their eggs atop it, and when the hatchlings emerge, they devour the old neogi and one another until only a few of the strongest newborns are left. Sometimes the newborns, united by a singular evil purpose, coalesce into a skittering swarm instead.

#### NEOGI PIRATE

Neogi pirates are adult neogi that serve as crew members aboard nightspiders (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) and other neogi-controlled vessels.

Neogi society makes no distinction between individuals, aside from the ability that a given creature has to control others, and they don't comprehend the emotional aspects of existence that humans and similar beings experience. To a neogi, hatred is as foreign a sensation as love, and showing loyalty in the absence of authority is foolishness.

Neogi pirates (and adult neogi in general) mark themselves and those they capture through the use of dyes, transformational magic, and other markings intended to signify rank, achievements, and the identity of the individual's leader. By these signs, neogi can identify each other's place in the hierarchy-and they must defer to those of higher station or risk harsh punishment.

#### NEOGI VOID HUNTER

A neogi void hunter is bigger than a typical adult neogi and often fills the role of captain aboard a nightspider (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide). The void hunter pledges fealty to one or more stellar entities in exchange for a taste of their immense power. These entities-known by such names as Acamar, Caiphon, Gibbeth, and Hadar-resemble stars and embody the essence of evil.

# PLASMOIDS

Plasmoids are intelligent oozes that can alter their shape at will. Their amorphous bodies have a soft, malleable texture, and plasmoids can extrude up to five pseudopods, each one up to 5 feet long. They use their pseudopods for locomotion as well as for manipulating objects.

Every plasmoid has a mass of nerves for a brain. Plasmoids don't have internal organs as humans know them, but they have pores through which they absorb oxygen. Up to four times in its life, a plasmoid can reproduce by joining with another member of its species. After this merging, the two plasmoids separate, and one of them (determined randomly) divides in half. When a plasmoid splits in two, one of the resulting creatures is the original, and the other is a physical duplicate that lacks the experience and knowledge of its parent.

A plasmoid talks by forcing air through tubular cavities in its body, giving its voice a whistling quality.

#### PLASMOID BOSS

On occasion, due to some biological anomaly, a plasmoid balloons in size upon reaching adulthood (around the age of twenty years). Plasmoids who use their increased size and strength to boss around smaller, weaker creatures can easily end up in positions of power, surrounded by loyal underlings, sycophants, and would-be usurpers. A plasmoid boss might be the master of a guild, the leader of a criminal enterprise, the lord of a plasmoid community, or the captain of a spelljamming ship. Regardless of the roles they secure for themselves, plasmoid bosses need no small amount of charm and wit, in addition to their strength and size, to stay in power for long.

#### PLASMOID EXPLORER

Wanderlust compels some plasmoids to explore the Astral Plane and visit different worlds of the Material Plane. Such an explorer usually travels light, keeping its possessions in a backpack or similar container.

#### PLASMOID WARRIOR

These battle-hardened plasmoids can toughen their outer surfaces, giving themselves protection comparable to light armor.

# PSURLONS

Psurlons are malevolent, wormlike creatures that live on the Astral Plane. A fully grown specimen is 7 feet long. They have legs that end in hooves and arms that end in hands with three long fingers. A psurlon's eyeless head resembles that of an earthworm, capped by a maw ringed with teeth. Psurlons adorn themselves in richly colored robes and rarely wear armor or carry weapons.

Psurlons live for thousands of years because they spend most of their time in the Deep Astral. Every hundred years or so, psurlons leave their astral strongholds, invade Wildspace systems, and indulge in a seven-year-long ceremony called the Feast of Worlds, during which they consume as many sentient life-forms as they can before returning to the Astral Plane. Psurlons prefer the flesh of humans and halflings but don't mind feasting on other folk. They use their spellcasting abilities to infiltrate the settlements of their intended victims.

On the Material Plane, psurlons have been known to work with mind flavers. Together, they collect victims to feed on; the illithids devour the victims' brains while the psurlons consume the rest of the prey. Githyanki despise psurlons because of this alliance and attack psurlon strongholds in the Deep Astral wherever they are found.

When a psurlon dies, other psurlons store the corpse in a safe place. As the corpse decays, the psurlons lay one or more eggs inside it. These eggs hatch 24 hours later, each one producing a Tiny worm. For the next seven days, the worms feed on the corpse and on each other until only one remains. This worm crawls out of the putrescent remains of its dead host as an adult psurlon.

#### PSURLON LEADER

One out of every hundred psurlons is a mutant with two heads, one at each end of its body, and a superior intellect. Other psurlons look to the two-headed ones for leadership.

#### PSURLON RINGER

A psurlon can use magic to assume the form of a specific Medium Humanoid. First, the psurlon must consume the creature it wants to imitate. It then enters a psionic trance for 8 hours, at the end of which it takes on the appearance of the creature it ate. The psurlon gains that creature's memories and languages, but none of its class features or other abilities. The transformation is permanent and can be undone only by a wish spell. Despite appearances, the psurlon ringer is still an Aberration, and other psurlons recognize it for what it is.

# REIGAR

Reigar are androgynous folk who evolved into a humanoid shape from a species of cephalopods similar to octopi. They have bioluminescent freckles and the ability to change the coloration of their skin. A glory (or halo) surrounds each of them. This magical display is a cloud of twinkling, glittering motes that changes color randomly and repels attacks.

Reigar don't trust one another, which has been the case ever since they destroyed their home world in a war that ended with a cataclysmic event called the Master Stroke. The planet's destruction was the culmination of a plot to create the most beautiful display of carnage the multiverse had ever seen. Reigar exist solely to make art and wage war. They consider warfare to be the highest form of artistic endeavor, and every act of violence they commit is done with the intent of creating something beautiful.

Reigar wander Wildspace and the Astral Sea in search of artistic inspiration, traveling in symbiotic organic ships that they create (see "Esthetic" earlier in this book). Each reigar possesses a magic item called a talarith, which it created and to which it alone can attune. If this object is lost or destroyed, it takes 1d10 + 20 days for the reigar to craft another one.

As an action, a reigar can use its talarith to summon a golem that looks just like the reigar. The golem obeys the reigar's commands and uses the reigar's statistics, except it is a Construct that doesn't have a talarith of its own. The golem vanishes after 1 hour, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. After summoning a golem, the reigar must finish a short or long rest before this property can be used again.

Trident. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) force damage if the reigar is wearing its talarith.

Chromatic Bolt. Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, range 90 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (5d8) damage of a type chosen by the reigar from the following list: cold, fire, lightning, or radiant.

Summon Golem (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). Using its talarith, the reigar summons a golem-like duplicate of itself. The duplicate obeys the reigar's commands and uses the reigar's statistics, except it is an unaligned Construct that doesn't have a talarith of its own. The duplicate takes its turn immediately after the reigar. It vanishes after 1 hour or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.

# SCAVVERS

Scavvers are shark-like scavengers that fly through space, feeding on whatever they can fit in their mouths. Scavvers are not always aggressive; often thev trail behind larger creatures as well as ships and asteroids, living off droppings and discarded refuse. They can enter the air envelopes of these bodies, so that as their "host" moves (often at high speed), the scavvers keep pace. The lesser varieties-brown and gray-rarely rise above the level of nuisances. The larger varieties are more formidable, in part because thev often don't wait for their meals to come to them.

A scavver has a single large eye in the leading edge of its head. This eve glows while the creature is awake. Its wide mouth is full of sharp teeth. A scavver flies in lazy circles when it sleeps but otherwise moves through space much as a shark swims through water.

#### BROWN SCAVVER

Brown scavvers are 10 feet long and range in color from sun-dappled brownish gold to dark umber. It takes them days to digest a meal, during which time they attack only in self-defense.

A brown scavver likes to swallow its prev whole. The creature's stomach is filled with poisonous gas, which kills off anything that survives being swallowed.

CLOCKWISE FROM TOP: NIGHT SCAVVER, GRAY SCAVVER, VOID SCAVVER, BROWN SCAVVER

#### GRAY SCAVVER

Gray scavvers are 6 feet long and travel in packs. The scent of blood sends them into a feeding frenzy, but wounding one usually weakens it enough to make it break off its attack.

#### NIGHT SCAVVER

Night scavvers are 15 feet long. Their coloration resembles that of Wildspace itself: white spots (representing stars) sprinkled amid dark patches and patterns of color. They fearlessly invade the air envelopes of spelljamming ships and attack crew members on deck.

Cooked night scavver meat is a popular offering in taverns across Wildspace.

#### VOID SCAVVER

Void scavvers are 20 feet long. Each one is a solitary menace with a pitch-black hide. While most other scavvers are content to feed on kitchen scraps, a void scavver goes after the cook.

A void scavver can emit an invisible ray from its eye that causes its target to feel fear even more intense than what it might normally experience given the creature's size and nature.

A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the scavver, and takes 13 (3d8) poison damage at the start of each of the scavver's turns from the poisonous gas in the scavver's gullet.

If the scavver takes 15 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the scavver must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the scavver. If the scavver dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.

# SOLAR DRAGONS

A solar dragon (also known as a radiant dragon or a sun dragon) is born in the heart of a star. It divides its time outside its lair between patrolling its territory and hunting for food. The dragon has a serpentine body, a pair of ventral limbs ending in long fins, nebulous wings that give off light, and gleaming, multicolored scales. It can see clearly even in blindingly bright light.

Solar dragons are fond of treasure just as all dragons are, but in the airless void of Wildspace, they value food even more. Solar dragons typically feed on kindori, scavvers, and other forms of space-dwelling wildlife. A solar dragon might mistake a distant spelljamming ship for possible prey and come within range of the vessel's weapons before realizing its error and veering away. A wise or experienced captain won't take the dragon's approach as a sign of hostility. Solar dragons that are fired upon have been known to batter the offending ships to flinders.

Solar dragons are territorial carnivores, and they behave accordingly. A young solar dragon might lay claim to an asteroid belt, where food is relatively plentiful, while an ancient solar dragon might consider an entire Wildspace system its hunting

ground. Thev tend to give a wide berth to Humanoid folk, whom they find violent and tiresome. Trespassers who are detected in a solar dragon's lair can expect to be met with resistance, followed by hostility, especially if the lair contains eggs.

A solar dragon egg has an obsidian shell, shiny black and opaque. When an egg is close to hatching, the shell becomes translucent, allowing the light from the unborn wyrmling's wings to shine through.

#### A SOLAR DRAGON'S LAIR

A solar dragon customarily lairs in a star's radiant core or nests in a gigantic, hollowed-out rock engulfed by the star's blinding radiance. A star in which a solar dragon makes its lair has the following effects on creatures:

- Blinding Radiance. A creature that is within 10 miles of the star or inside it is blinded by its intense light unless the creature has protective gear to shield its eyes, such as goggles of night or a similar form of eyewear.

Blinding Brilliance (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon emits magical light in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in this area must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

# SPACE CLOWN

Space clowns are the inhabitants of a Wildspace system known as Clownspace. The humans who once inhabited the system's three ring-shaped worlds placed their faith in a god of revelry. Their worship ceremonies were centered on festivals and frivolity. Over time, the people's happiness hinged on the ever-increasing consumption of an elixir called Thrill Joy. Only after they became addicted did they discover that the priests of their faith had distilled the elixir from demonic ichor and the nectar of the bozo flower. Eventually, Thrill Joy transformed the faithful into fiendish creatures and "blessed" them with clown-like appearances.

Space clowns acquired their first spelljamming helms from dohwar merchants (see "Dohwar" earlier in this book). Subsequent visits to other Wildspace systems led to contact with a multitude of other folk. In the wake of these encounters, love and fear of clowns has spread to all corners of the multiverse, just as the space clowns have done themselves.

Marauding space clowns feed on Humanoid flesh. They travel through space in garishly decorated

Dying Burst. When the clown drops to 0 hit points, it pops like a balloon, releasing a splash of putrid, corrosive ichor. Each creature within 5 feet of the clown when it bursts must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Squeakers. The clown wears shoes that squeak when it walks. The squeaking can be heard out to a range of 30 feet. The squeaking is silenced while the clown's Phantasmal Form is in effect.

Ray Gun. Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (2d6) psychic damage, and if the target is a Humanoid with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, it must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target perceives everything it sees or hears as hilariously funny and is incapacitated for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Spellcasting. The clown casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability:

At will: friends, mage hand, prestidigitation 1/day each: mirror image, spider climb

#### BONUS ACTIONS

Phantasmal Form (3/Day). The clown veils itself and everything it is wearing and carrying in an illusion that makes it look like some other creature of its size or smaller (such as a child) or an object small enough to fit in the clown's space (such as a floating balloon). Maintaining this effect requires the clown's concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), and the illusion fails to hold up to physical inspection. As an action, a creature that can see the clown's illusory form can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check, piercing the illusion and discerning the clown's true form on a success.

# SPACE EEL

Space eels avoid confrontations with larger creatures unless the eels are starving. These 5-foot-long scavengers might trail a spelljamming ship and feed on barnacles they detach from the ship's hull. Wildspace hunters try to catch and kill the eels for their meat-a task easier to describe than to accomplish.

Unusual Nature. The eel doesn't require air.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. If it isn't attached to a creature, the eel makes one Bite attack and one Tail Spine attack.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the eel attaches to the target. While attached, the eel can't make Bite attacks. Instead, the target takes 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage at the start of each of the eel's turns. The eel can detach itself as a bonus action. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the eel.

Tail Spine. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

# SPACE GUPPY

Space guppies are 2- to 3-foot-long, fish-like creatures that glide through Wildspace and the Astral Sea. Chwinga astronauts (described earlier in this book), sprites, and other Tiny creatures occasionally use space guppies as mounts.

# SPACE HAMSTERS

Space hamsters resemble their terrestrial kin, both in their appearance and general demeanor, and they come in a variety of colors.

#### GIANT SPACE HAMSTER

Giant space hamsters are cute, plant-eating rodents as big as brown bears. They tend to avoid other creatures, especially threatening ones, but they can be trained to serve as mounts and beasts of burden. Gnomes have tried to build spelljamming ships powered by giant space hamster wheels, so far without success.

#### SPACE HAMSTER

The first space hamsters were created by wizards who used magic to shrink giant space hamsters to wee size, leading their creators to refer to them as miniature giant space hamsters. The magic also made the space hamsters smarter and telepathic.

These benign rodents are native to Wildspace, though countless numbers of them have found their way to worlds throughout the Material Plane, where they are known simply as hamsters. They keep their telepathic ability hidden from most other creatures they come near.

#### BONUS ACTIONS

Escape. The hamster takes the Dash or Disengage action.

# SPACE MOLLYMAWK

Space mollymawks are as common in Wildspace as albatrosses are on the Material Plane. They perch on the hulls of spelljamming ships and move from one ship's air envelope to another's when they need to.

A fully grown specimen is 3 feet tall with a 10-foot wingspan, and it eats whatever it can scavenge. If it finds a reliable food source, it lingers in the area (usually around a ship) until the food becomes scarce. Superstitious Wildspace voyagers consider it bad luck to kill a space mollymawk.

# SPACE SWINE

Space swine are a species of winged boar bred by dohwars (described earlier in this book) for a variety of uses. They can serve as mounts for Small creatures, and they also make fine trackers and capable beasts of burden. Space swine that are trained for battle are typically outfitted with half-plate barding and are referred to as death squealers.

A fully grown specimen stands 3 feet high at the shoulder and is 5 to 6 feet long. Space swine eat just about anything, but they prefer truffles. A space swine also tastes delicious when roasted and served with applesauce.

# SSURRAN

Ssurran are lizardfolk who have adapted to life in arid climates and in Wildspace. You can use the lizardfolk stat blocks in the Monster Manual to represent them, in addition to the variants described below.

#### SSURRAN DEFILER

Ssurran defilers can lay waste to the plant life around them and draw vital energy at the same time from other creatures that are caught in the area.

#### SSURRAN POISONER

Ssurran poisoners coat their weapons with toxin and hurl bombs that release poisonous gas.

Defile (Recharge 6). Ordinary vegetation within 10 feet of the ssurran withers and dies. In addition, each creature within 10 feet of the ssurran must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The ssurran regains 5 (1d10) hit points for each creature that fails the saving throw.

Spellcasting (Psionics). The ssurran casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability:

At will: mage hand (the hand is invisible) 1/day: invisibility (self only)

Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the ssurran throws a bomb, roll a d6; on a roll of 4 or lower, the ssurran has no more bombs to throw.

# STARLIGHT APPARITION

The transparent projections of unfortunate souls who perished in Wildspace or in the Astral Sea are known as starlight apparitions. Each one has a luminous, incorporeal appearance that resembles its former self, but with eyes that glow.

A starlight apparition is different from a ghost. While a ghost is doomed to haunt the place where it died until some promise or goal it couldn't achieve in life is fulfilled, the goal of a starlight apparition is to help someone else avoid or overcome a perilous obstacle or accomplish a difficult task. A starlight apparition comes into being when the soul of a deceased individual, from its resting place in the afterlife, projects a spectral copy of itself across a vast distance with the help of a deity or another powerful celestial entity. The apparition lasts only as long as its services are needed to complete the task at hand; then it fades away, never to return.

Astral Existence. The apparition can exist only on the Astral Plane. If it is sent to a location not on the Astral Plane, the apparition is destroyed.

Illumination. While it has at least 1 hit point, the apparition sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

Incorporeal Movement. The apparition can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Unusual Nature. The apparition doesn't require air, drink, food, or sleep.

#### ACTIONS

Radiant Eruption. Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (5d6 + 3) radiant damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Possession (Recharge 6). One Humanoid that the apparition can see within 5 feet of itself must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the apparition; the apparition then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The apparition now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The apparition can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the apparition ends it as a bonus action, the body leaves the Astral Plane, or the apparition is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the apparition reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. If it reappears in a location not on the Astral Plane, the apparition is destroyed. The target is immune to this apparition's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

# THRI-KREEN

Thri-kreen are carnivores with insectile features and two pairs of arms. Because their bodies are encased in protective chitin, they tend to eschew armor. Although thri-kreen don't need to sleep, they do require periods of inactivity to revitalize themselves.

The Thri-kreen language doesn't employ words in the usual sense. To demonstrate emotion and reaction, thri-kreen clack their mandibles and wave their antennae, indicating to other thri-kreen what they are thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this method of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. To interact with creatures of other sapient species, thri-kreen rely on a form of telepathy.

Thri-kreen often use weapons of their own design, particularly the gythka (a two-handed polearm with a blade at each end) and a light thrown weapon called a chatkcha (a flat, triangular wedge with three serrated blades). Gythkas typically have shafts of bone and obsidian blades, while chatkchas are usually made of sharpened bone or crystal.

A generic thri-kreen stat block appears in the Monster Manual. This section provides a few more options.

#### THRI-KREEN GLADIATOR

Thri-kreen gladiators relish opportunities to test their mettle in combat and often paint their carapaces with the blood of their enemies.

#### THRI-KREEN HUNTER

Thri-kreen hunters are skilled foragers and stalkers. A thri-kreen hunter encountered in Wildspace might be on the trail of a fugitive or leading a gang of pirates.

#### THRI-KREEN MYSTIC

Thri-kreen mystics use psionics to navigate difficult terrain in Wildspace, turn invisible, and drain life from their prey. They often serve as spelljammers aboard thri-kreen ships.

The thri-kreen regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.

Spellcasting (Psionics). The thri-kreen casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability:

At will: levitate (self only), mage hand (the hand is invisible) 1/day each: freedom of movement (self only), invisibility (self only)

#### BONUS ACTIONS

Chameleon Carapace. The thri-kreen changes the color of its carapace to match the color and texture of its surroundings, gaining advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes to hide in those surroundings.

# VAMPIRATES

Vampirates are the walking, talking husks of dead pirates who refused to go quietly into the afterlife. They ply the void in their ships, plundering unsuspecting vessels and feeding on the life energy of those unlucky enough to cross their path.

A vampirate appears as a gaunt figure with milkywhite eves and skin as dry as parchment. Some have a peg leg or a hook in place of a hand-mementos of a life of misadventure. A vampirate has fangs like a vampire's but doesn't use them to draw vital fluids from prey, which vampirates consider an unsavory act. Rather, a vampirate drains life energy from another creature by touching it or by siphoning off its energy from a short distance away. As it feeds on the energy of other creatures, its appearance becomes more robust, although it never truly looks alive.

Vampirates eat, drink, and sleep because they like to, not because they must. They rest in wooden coffins or crates full of grave dirt. In the absence of such containers, they can treat their ship's hold as one big coffin and sleep amid their cargo. When they're not sleeping or marauding, a crew of vampirates whiles away the hours by drinking rum and singing grim chanteys.

A ship crewed by vampirates usually has one or more shadows aboard-the Undead remains of some of the vampirates' victims.

succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) necrotic damage.

Spider Climb. The vampirate can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Unusual Nature. The vampirate doesn't require air or drink.

#### ACTIONS

Energy Drain. Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d10) necrotic damage. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies and instantly transforms into a free-willed shadow under the DM's control.

Light Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.

#### VAMPIRATE CAPTAIN

How a crew of vampirates conducts itself depends entirely on the mood and disposition of the captain. The crew of one ship might behave like a murderous mob, while another might abide by an ancient code of chivalry. One captain might allow the crew of a plundered ship to live, while another might leave only flotsam and jetsam in the pirates' wake.

The captain is often accompanied by an undying companion, such as a crawling claw or a will-o'-wisp.

Unusual Nature. The captain doesn't require air or drink.

#### ACTIONS

Heavy Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d10 + 3) piercing damage.

Ship Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). A ship upon which the captain stands, along with all creatures and objects aboard it, becomes invisible to creatures not aboard the ship. The captain must concentrate on this magical effect to maintain it (as if concentrating on a spell), and it lasts for up to 1 hour. The effect ends if the captain leaves the ship.

#### REACTIONS

Uncanny Dodge. The captain halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The captain must be able to see the attacker.

#### VAMPIRATE MAGE

A ship of vampirates needs a spellcaster to operate the spelljamming helm. A vampirate mage rarely, if ever, leaves the helm.

Disembodied Voice. Up to three times in its life, the zodar can cause a message of up to twenty-five words to issue from the air around it. It speaks only when it has something profoundly important to say, and the message can be understood by any creature that has an Intelligence score of 2 or higher.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the zodar fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

# ZODAR

A zodar is a bipedal entity whose body is encased in an obsidian exoskeleton. It has no facial features aside from two narrow, vertical slits that resemble eyes, and its countenance betrays no hint of pain or emotion. Underneath its armored exterior, a zodar's body is composed of tightly knit muscle fibers that make it incredibly strong and heavy. A zodar weighs 1,500 pounds.

No one knows how many zodars exist or where they came from, but the most popular hypothesis is that they are the creations of some long-forgotten god. Zodars interact with other sapient creatures in a manner that goes beyond mere aloofness. They simply hover in silence. When a zodar finally performs some significant action, the reasons for that action aren't always clear.

One interpretation of this behavior posits that each zodar has a specific mission and is relentless in its pursuit of the goal, but it reacts oddly to situations that don't involve its mission because it doesn't know what else to do. Another theory is that all zodars are working in concert to achieve some master objective. A third, less ominous idea is that zodars lost their sense of purpose when their creator vanished, and they are struggling to find their new role.

A zodar can cause speech to issue from the air around it on three occasions in its lifetime. When it feels compelled to speak, it chooses its words wisely. It can also warp the fabric of the multiverse to cast the wish spell as its final act-it is destroyed once the spell is cast.

Transport Inhibitor. The zodar can't be teleported or sent to any plane of existence against its will.

Unusual Nature. The zodar doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The zodar makes two Crushing Fist attacks. Before or after these attacks, the zodar uses Forced Teleport.

Crushing Fist. Melee Weapon Attack: + 15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (2d10 + 10) force damage.

Forced Teleport. The zodar magically warps space around one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (4d10) force damage, and the zodar teleports it, along with any equipment it's wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that the zodar can see and that can support the target. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't teleported.

Wish. The zodar casts the wish spell, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17). After casting this spell, the zodar turns to dust and is destroyed.

PRINCE XELETH ASTRIDE A SOLAR DRAGON

# INTRODUCTION Wildspace Awaits!

HIS DUNGEONS & DRAGONS ADVENTURE begins in a world of your choosing, then ventures into Wildspace and the Astral Sea. The characters navigate these environments aboard ships that can traverse vast distances by using a magical form of travel known as spelljamming. Before running this adventure, read the Astral Adventurer's Guide, which contains information about these settings and how spelljamming works. The adventure assumes the characters have no prior experience with spelljamming-but that is about to change!

The information in this book is for the DM's eyes only. If you're planning to play the adventure with someone else as your DM, stop reading now.

# ADVENTURE SUMMARY

This story revolves around the characters' efforts to save their home world from an attack by an empire of astral elves. The attack is underway when the adventure begins. After taking refuge aboard a spelljamming vessel, the characters head for the stars to discover who is responsible for the attack and how they can save their world.

During the adventure, the characters encounter many space-dwelling creatures, some of which become companions on the party's voyage. The characters also meet Princess Xedalli, an astral elf who is embroiled in a power struggle with her twin brother, Prince Xeleth, over who will rule the empire that currently threatens the characters' world. With or without Xedalli's help, the characters must assemble an unlikely alliance to strike at the heart of the astral elf empire.

The characters encounter many grandiose locations as the adventure unfolds, including an asteroid city known as the Rock of Bral and the imperial citadel of the astral elves, which orbits a star called Xaryxis.

#### XARYXIS

The light of Xaryxis has nourished the Xaryxian Empire for millennia, serving as a wellspring for the magical power that the astral elves of Xaryxispace use to sustain their empire. A thousand years ago, the star's light began to fade, threatening the elves' prosperity, so Emperor Xavan turned the dying star into a parasite that leaches the life from worlds using crystal seeds harvested from the star.

After the elves select a suitable host world, ships known as star moths release hundreds of astral seeds into the planet's atmosphere. The seeds fall from the sky and bury themselves in the ground and the oceans of the world. After the astral seeds take root, they produce enormous crystalline vines. The tendrils of these vines extend deep into the world and draw life energy from it. Once the vines have sapped a world of its energy, a process that can take months, they send out a bright beam of light that travels back to Xaryxis, temporarily replenishing the star's radiance and leaving the host world a barren husk.

Although Xaryxis shines brilliantly after each replenishment, it isn't long before the light of Xaryxis begins to wane once more, presaging the doom of another world.

Once astral seeds have taken root on a host world, there is no easy way to stop the transformationthe vines are too thick and too numerous to be uprooted. Destroying the star Xaryxis, which acts as a lodestone for the astral seeds, is the only way to free a world from their grip. If the star goes dark, the crystal vines release their stored energy back into the host world, shrivel, and die.

#### ADVENTURE STRUCTURE

This adventure has four parts, each divided into three chapters. Each chapter is designed to be run as a single play experience lasting 2 to 3 hours, with the expectation that a group should be able to complete the adventure in twelve sessions of play.

Each chapter begins with an overview that gives you a sense of what is ahead for the heroes and recaps what has happened so far. There's no telling how a session will unfold, since the players have some control over the plot, but the text tries to give you enough information to run the various creatures and encounters. If the characters do something unexpected, improvise as best you can while gently steering them toward their main goal. Each chapter ends with a cliffhanger to set the stage for the next session, assuming things go as planned.

The four parts of the adventure are as follows:

Part 1: Seeds of Destruction chronicles the devastation wrought by the astral seeds on the characters' home world and the party's escape into Wildspace. After fleeing to the Rock of Bral, the characters seek out Commodore Krux, a giff, A XARYXIAN STAR MOTH JETTISONS ONE OF MANY ASTRA SEEDS WHILE ORBITING AN UNSUSPECTING WORLD

hoping he can help them thwart the Xaryxian Empire's machinations and save the characters' world in the process.

- Part 2: Terrors of the Void deals with the characters' journey to the edge of their Wildspace system, where they encounter Princess Xedalli and learn the enormity of the task that lies before them. The characters head for Doomspace, where Krux plans to join a coalition of those that oppose the Xaryxian Empire.
- Part 3: Chaos in Doomspace begins with the party's arrival in Doomspace, where the coalition they had intended to join turns out to be a bunch of quarreling factions. They must find a way to unite the factions before attacking the Xaryxian Empire.
- Part 4: Saviors of the Multiverse describes Xaryxispace and the characters' climactic encounter with Prince Xeleth and the armada under his command. Finally, the characters arrive at the imperial citadel, where they discover the true cost of saving their world and must decide the fate of Xaryxis and the Xaryxian Empire before making the long voyage home.

# RUNNING THE ADVENTURE

To run the adventure, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks (Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual). In addition, you need the other two books included in this product: Boo's Astral Menagerie and the Astral Adventurer's Guide.

Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.

When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, "Hey, DM, you better get this creature's stat block ready. You're going to need it." Usually, you can find the stat block in the Monster Manual; if the stat block is in Boo's Astral Menagerie, the adventure's text tells you so.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the Player's Handbook, while magic items are described in the Dungeon Master's Guide, unless the adventure's text directs you to the Astral Adventurer's Guide.

The Astral Adventurer's Guide describes the many types of spelljamming vessels mentioned in the adventure and includes deck plans for each one. At your discretion, you can provide the players with a copy of the deck plans for whatever ship they're sailing aboard and allow them to manage the ship's activity during encounters, freeing you to concentrate on running the nonplayer characters and their ships.

#### ADVENTURE INSPIRATION

Light of Xaryxis is inspired by the 1980 film Flash Gordon and serialized Flash Gordon comic strips from the 1930s. The adventure's heroes, like Flash Gordon himself, must defeat otherworldly foes to save their home planet. Campy supporting characters, implausible situations, and over-the-top dialogue help push the story toward its inevitable conclusion. Absurd plot twists undercut the sense of urgency, keeping the heroes on their toes as they stumble from one cliffhanger to the next.

Here are some things you can do to make Light of Xaryxis feel like the pulpy sci-fi tales that inspired it:

- . Watch the 1980 Flash Gordon film. It's not Shakespeare or Scorsese, but the dialogue is quotable, and the costumes and sets are fantastic.
- Any nonplayer character who isn't fighting the heroes should naturally defer to the heroes, giving players the sense that their characters matter (no matter how puny and insignificant they might seem to their enemies).
- End each session with a cliffhanger. The adventure already has one at the end of each chapter, but you can create your own cliffhanger by ending a session with an unexpected threat, twist, or revelation.
- When you're ready to begin a new chapter, read or paraphrase the recap that appears at the start of the chapter, embellishing it with pertinent events or memorable quotes from earlier game sessions.

#### STARTING CHARACTERS

The adventure assumes that the characters start at 5th level. If your players have characters of lower level, they will need to go on some other adventures first to gain enough experience to advance to 5th level. Both the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Starter Set and the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Essentials Kit contain adventures that will take characters from 1st level to 5th level. Alternatively, you can simply ask your players to create new 5th-level characters, as described in the next section.

#### CHARACTER CREATION

If spacefaring races are common on your world, you can add backgrounds and races from the Astral Adventurer's Guide to the list of character options that players can choose from when creating their characters. As the DM, you decide what is available to your players and what isn't.

If, during the adventure, a player wants to create a new character (perhaps because their previous one died or left the party), that player can roll up a new character of the same level as the rest of the adventuring party, choosing from the options available. If the party is in Wildspace or the Astral Sea, you can assume that all the character options from the Astral Adventurer's Guide are available.

To create 5th-level characters for this adventure, players can use the character creation steps outlined in the Player's Handbook. In addition to more hit points, class features, and spells, each character has normal starting equipment plus 625 gp to spend on additional nonmagical gear. If you're running a high magic campaign, each character also gains one uncommon magic item of the player's choice, subject to your approval.

#### CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT

At the end of each of the adventure's parts, everyone in the party receives enough experience points to advance 1 level so that they are at the level they should be for the next chapter, as shown in the Character Levels table. Characters who finish the adventure advance to 9th level.

#### CHARACTER LEVELS

| Part | Character Level |
| --- | --- |
| 1: Seeds of Destruction | 5th |
| 2: Terrors of the Void | 6th |
| 3: Chaos in Doomspace | 7th |
| 4: Saviors of the Multiverse | 8th |

#### WHERE TO BEGIN?

The adventure begins in a coastal city or port town on a world where the characters are either seeking their fortunes or resting between adventures. Since most of this adventure takes place in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, the initial setting doesn't have much effect on how the adventure will play out. The characters' home world serves mainly to set the stakes for the story-it's in danger of being destroyed !- so using a world your players are familiar with works best, whether that is a published campaign setting or a world of your own creation.

If you used Lost Mine of Phandelver (the adventure in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Starter Set) or Dragon of Icespire Peak (the adventure in the

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Essentials Kit) to get the characters to 5th level, then Light of Xaryxis begins in the same region featured in those introductory adventures: the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms setting, on the world of Toril. The city of Neverwinter, one of several major ports along the Sword Coast, could easily be where the characters find themselves at the beginning of this adventure.

All the locations the characters visit in this adventure are described in this book, and further details about the Rock of Bral are provided in the Astral Adventurer's Guide.

#### USING THE STARLIGHT APPARITION

In addition to being a fascinating encounter in its own right, the starlight apparition (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) can be a useful device for you if a key nonplayer character meets an unfortunate and unexpected end. If, later in the adventure, the characters need a piece of information only that nonplayer character would know, you can have the nonplayer character appear in the form of a starlight apparition to guide the characters.

# CHAPTER 1 Astral Rain,

S THE ADVENTURE OPENS, THE CHARACTERS are going about their daily business in a bustling coastal settlement, where everyone is talking about the spectacular meteor showers that have blazed through the sky the past several nights. In fact, what folks have witnessed are showers of astral seeds falling from space and plunging deep into the ground and water in and around the settlement. Some of these seeds have now germinated. The adventure begins when enormous crystalline vines erupt from beneath the streets, throwing the community into chaos.

When you are ready to begin play, read:

Your adventures have taken you to a coastal community, where local fishing boats share the harbor with trade vessels from far and wide. Lately everyone has been discussing the deluge of falling stars that has lit up the evening sky for the past several nights. Some say these celestial events are omens of impending disaster. Others believe they are a precursor to the gods descending from the heavens to walk the land. No one knows for sure.

You are just finishing your midday meal while listening to a blacksmith tell about being awakened last night by a loud crash. According to the smith, a crystalline vine burst out of the ground and punched a hole through the roof of his neighbor's bakery. "Must be divine punishment for the bad pies and steep prices," says the blacksmith with a nervous chuckle. Suddenly, the earth shakes violently beneath your feet. You hear the dull roar of a distant eruption. The smith and several others hurry outside. Joining them, you see a sinuous, crystalline vine erupting from the ground a few blocks away-tall enough to be seen above the rooftops. Screams of panic rise from the same direction.

A sailor standing in your midst says, "I think it's time I returned to my ship. You're welcome to join me. You would be wise to flee as well." With that, she makes her way toward the docks.

The ground churns again, and more eruptions burst through the streets all around you. From these sites sprout smaller crystalline vines that uproot themselves and begin lurching through the streets, driving panicked citizens before them, while the enormous vine in the distance stretches ever taller.

The friendly sailor, Elaina Sartell, is described later in the chapter. She flees at once, leaving the characters to decide their own course of action.

The ambulatory vines are six astral blights (see the accompanying stat block). They focus their attacks on nearby commoners, ignoring the characters except for any who attack them. The blights' slow speed means the characters can evade them easily.

The characters have several choices for how to proceed:

- Fight the Blights. If the characters destroy all six blights, new ones appear; roll a d6 to determine how many. These new arrivals either burst up from the ground or shamble along streets and alleys, converging on the characters' location. Each time the characters defeat a group of blights, a new wave appears; repeat the die roll to see how many more blights arrive. With the appearance of each new wave, it should become increasingly obvious to the players that the characters can't eliminate all the blights and should consider a different course of action.
- Head to the Docks. If the characters heed Elaina Sartell's advice and head to the docks, run the "Trouble at the Docks" encounter when they arrive.
- Hole Up. If the characters try to barricade themselves in a building or find somewhere else in the settlement to hide, the increasingly violent earth tremors cause their shelter to partially collapse, making it apparent that there's no safe refuge in the settlement. The characters will need to choose another option.
- Investigate the Crystalline Vine. If the characters make their way toward the enormous crystalline vine, see "Crystalline Vine" below.
- Make for the Outskirts. If the characters bolt through the streets and alleys toward the outskirts of the settlement, see "Danger in the Streets" below.

# ASTRAL BLIGHT

Illumination. While it has at least 1 hit point, the astral blight sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Unusual Nature. The blight doesn't require air or sleep.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The blight makes two Heat-Draining Vine attacks.

Heat-Draining Vine. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) radiant damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target takes 3 (1d6) cold damage at the start of each of its turns. The blight has two vines, each of which can grapple one creature.

# CRYSTALLINE VINE

The vine growing in the center of the settlement sprouted after an astral seed fell from the sky. crashed into the bakery, and buried itself in the ground. The vine is 50 feet wide at its base, rises 1,000 feet into the air, and is still growing. It is made of an iridescent mineral that is impervious to the characters' spells and weapons. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check determines that the substance is a type of living crystal.

No astral blights congregate near the crystalline vine, which means the characters can approach and study it without being attacked. The vine is warm to the touch and pulses with light. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes that the vine's roots extend deep into the earth and are feeding on the planet's thermal energy. There appears to be no way to stop this process.

As it grows taller, the vine also grows wider, slowly pushing away the dirt and debris from around its base. Inform the players that the tremors seem to be getting stronger as the vine grows, leaving them with two options: flee for the docks (see "To the Docks" below) or flee for the outskirts (see "Danger in the Streets" below).

# DANGER IN THE STREETS

Astral blights roam the streets. Members of the local militia (use the guard stat block) try to hold the blights at bay long enough for unarmed civilians to flee the vicinity. If the characters stay in a single location for longer than 1 minute, 1d6 astral blights (see the accompanying stat block) converge on their location and attack them.

The following events occur as the characters move through streets and alleys toward the outskirts of the settlement, but not if they head straight to the docks:

- Avalanche of Debris. Tremors cause buildings close to the characters to collapse, catching them in an avalanche of debris. Each character must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- Terrified Citizens. A crowd of thirty commoners rushes past the characters, led by a scrappy youngster who shouts, "To the docks! We'll take one of the ships! It's our only hope!" An old woman grabs the arm of a character and moans, "Those vines are everywhere! There's nowhere safe! We're all doomed!" Suddenly, a tremor causes a building to collapse, burying half of the crowd and scattering what's left of it.

IO

If the characters leave the settlement by land, they see dozens of gigantic crystalline vines sprouting across the countryside as hundreds of astral blights rove the fields. The tremors become full-blown earthquakes as the crystalline vines plunge their roots into the earth and reach hundreds of feet into the air. Characters who press on in this direction instead of heading back to the docks are eventually rescued (see "Emergency Airlift" below).

# TROUBLE AT THE DOCKS

When the characters arrive at the docks, read:

The scene at the docks is chaotic. Hundreds of people swarm the piers, trying to push their way onto three vessels that haven't yet set sail: two longships and a galleon. A group of thugs in black leather armor use their clubs on a crowd of screaming commoners, keeping the people away from the ships as they're loaded with cargo under the supervision of a sneering man with long red hair.

A woman steps out of the crowd and wipes blood from her chin. "Glad to see you again," she says with a smile. "I'm Captain Elaina Sartell, and one of those ships is mine. Pity I can't reach it. Would you be good enough to help me? I promise to return the favor."

Captain Elaina Sartell, a chaotic good bandit captain, commands the galleon Moondancer. She is unflappable-an island of calm in a sea of chaos.

#### TRAEVUS AND HIS GANG

Captain Sartell identifies the red-haired man as a local crime lord named Traevus-a neutral evil veteran. The ten thugs blocking her path work for him.

Traevus and his thugs are indifferent toward the party but turn hostile if the characters try to force their way onto the Moondancer with Captain Sartell in tow. Although Sartell knows Traevus, he doesn't recognize her.

Traevus is intent on saving himself and as much of his merchandise as possible. As an action, a character can try to convince him to take the party and Sartell on as crew, doing so with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

If Traevus learns that Sartell is the ship's captain, he orders his thugs to apprehend Sartell, hoping that capturing her will help keep the crew of the Moondancer in line. If he is challenged, or if he catches one or more characters trying to get aboard the Moondancer, Traevus attacks along with six of his thugs while the others continue to hold back the mob that has gathered at the docks. If Traevus is defeated, any remaining thugs in his employ lose their

will to fight. Some are overrun by the mob, and the rest leap into the water and swim toward the two longships as they set sail.

Once the thugs are defeated, the Moondancer takes aboard the rest of the citizens gathered at the docks-sixty souls in all-before shoving off. See chapter 2 for more information about the Moondancer and its crew.

# POSSIBLE ENDINGS

If the characters boarded the Moondancer at the docks, wrap up the session with "Up and Away." Otherwise, use "Emergency Airlift."

#### UP AND AWAY

Once the characters and other passengers are safely aboard the Moondancer, read:

The crystalline vine coils upward, scraping the sky. From the harbor, you can see similar vines miles from the settlement, having burst out of the world and reaching skyward. As the Moondancer clears the harbor, Captain Sartell stamps her boot hard on the deck. "Flapjack!" she yells. "Take us up!"

Suddenly, the galleon lists and creaks as it rises out of the water and into the air! The world falls away beneath you as the Moondancer flies through the clouds and into the starry abyss of night.

#### Here ends chapter 1.

#### EMERGENCY AIRLIFT

If the characters don't make it to the docks, Captain Sartell reveals her identity to Traevus and negotiates a deal with him whereby she takes command of the Moondancer in exchange for delivering Traevus, his gang, and their belongings to a safe port. As soon as they set sail, Sartell orders the ship to take flight and rescue the party. Traevus and his thugs are too stunned by this development to interfere.

Wherever the characters happen to be, Sartell finds them. Read:

A great shadow falls over you. You look up to see a mighty galleon floating in midair, its sails ruffling in the breeze. A rope ladder tumbles down from the ship's side to hang mere feet above the ground, and a face appears over the side of the railing.

"Need a lift?" asks the sailor you met earlier.

Here ends chapter 1.

II

# CHAPTER 2 Attack of the Star Moth

Driven from a coastal settlement by gigantic crystalline vines, astral blights, and earthquakes, the characters secured passage aboard the Moondancer, a galleon under the command of Captain Elaina Sartell. The ship then rocketed into space!

As the Moondancer leaves the planet's atmosphere and enters Wildspace. Captain Sartell sets a course for the Rock of Bral. Now is the time for you to determine where the Rock of Bral is situated relative to the characters' home world. Once you've determined the Rock of Bral's location in Wildspace, estimate how many days it will take the Moondancer to get there. If the adventure began on Toril, the Rock of Bral is one of several asteroids orbiting the planet, and getting there takes only a few hours. Otherwise, assume the Rock orbits another world

CAPTAIN ELAINA SARTELL

or is situated in a nearby asteroid belt and requires several days to reach.

In this chapter, the Moondancer is intercepted by an astral elf vessel shortly after leaving the characters' world, but the characters have time to finish a short rest before the enemy ship arrives.

Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with chapter 2 of the Astral Adventurer's Guide. Keep the deck plans for the space galleon and the star moth handy, because they will come into play.

# ABOARD THE MOONDANCER

As the Moondancer leaves the characters' world behind, read:

Standing on the deck of the Moondancer, you see scores of crystalline vines erupting from the surface of your world, some of the vines reaching high enough to break through the clouds. You find yourself sailing through a void filled with colorful gases and blinking stars. A school of space-dwelling fish swims past the ship on the starboard side.

"Welcome to Wildspace," says Captain Sartell, sweeping her arms wide. "That was a close thing, down there. Blast if I know what those vines are or how to get rid of them, but somebody on the Rock of Bral might."

Only two members of the Moondancer's crew are aboard: Captain Sartell and a spelljamming flumph (see "Flapjack the Flumph" below). Depending on how events played out in chapter 1, the Moondancer might have the following passengers on board, in addition to the characters:

- · Traevus and his thugs (neither Traevus nor his thugs will take orders from Captain Sartell, instead keeping to themselves as long as the characters are around to thwart any open revolt)
- · Up to sixty commoners (six of whom are competent sailors)

The Moondancer is armed with two ballistae but has no crew to operate them. Its mangonel was destroyed in a recent engagement, and Captain Sartell hasn't replaced it yet. Getting a new mangonel was the main reason Sartell was on the party's home world, since wood is much easier to find there than at her usual port of call, the Rock of Bral.

#### CAPTAIN ELAINA SARTELL

Captain Sartell operates out of the Rock of Bral as a privateer under the commission of the city's ruler, Prince Andru. She assures the characters that they'll be safe there.

Once her ship docks at the Rock of Bral, Captain Sartell plans to offload the characters and the ship's other passengers. This act marks the extent of her willingness to help the characters.

#### FLAPIACK THE FLUMPH

One crew member staved aboard the Moondancer while it was in port: a flumph named Flapjack, who serves as the ship's spell jammer. Flapjack has the following additional action option:

Spellcasting. The flumph casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

At will: mage hand, minor illusion 1/day each: magic missile, unseen servant

#### FEATURES OF THE MOONDANCER

Use the space galleon deck plans in the Astral Adventurer's Guide to represent the Moondancer. Noteworthy features are described below:

- Area 3: Captain's Quarters. Among Captain Sartell's possessions is a locked treasure chest, which she keeps in her cabin. Captain Sartell carries the only key to the chest. As an action, a character can pick the lock by making a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or break open the chest with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. The chest contains three bottles of fine wine (10 gp each), six gold bracelets (25 gp each), nine pearls (100 gp each) in a velvet pouch, and a spell scroll of air bubble (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide).
- Area 5: Spelljamming Helm. The ship's spelljamming helm looks like a floating, ornate silver chair with a purple seat cushion and no legs. Glowing blue crystals underneath the seat project a magic circle onto the floor, stabilizing the chair. Flapjack the flumph sits in the chair while piloting the ship.
- Area 12: Upper Cargo Hold. The upper cargo hold contains a dozen healthy mules (which Sartell plans to sell as beasts of burden); sacks of food for the animals; and material placed here by Traevus and his gang (see chapter 1), which consists of twenty 40-pound crates of assorted martial weapons (2,000 gp total value) and five hundred bottles of brandy (3 gp each).
- Area 13: Lower Cargo Hold. The lower cargo hold contains crates of foodstuffs and casks of fresh water, enough to last ten Medium creatures for thirty days.

FLAPJACK

# WHEN ELVES ATTACK

The characters have time to take a short rest before trouble catches up to them and Captain Sartell presses them into service. At the end of the characters' short rest, read:

The ship slows as another vessel comes into view, approaching the Moondancer from astern. The pursuing vessel looks like a giant moth with wings made of iridescent crystal, similar in color and luster to the crystalline vines that ravaged your world. You can just make out figures on the other vessel's deck scrambling to arm the ship's mangonel.

"Astral elves," curses Captain Sartell, "and they don't look friendly. Best ready yourselves for a fight."

The astral elf vessel is a star moth called the Dark Star. It is crewed by three astral elf warriors-Captain Azmadian (lawful evil), Lieutenant Jalin (lawful evil), and Lieutenant Zanth (lawful neutral)-as well as a neutral evil astral elf star priest named Altura (the ship's spelljammer), and nine hadozee shipmates of various alignments (see Boo's Astral Menagerie for the astral elf and hadozee stat blocks).

THE DARK STAR

#### SHIP-TO-SHIP BATTLE

See chapter 2 of the Astral Adventurer's Guide for rules on ship-to-ship engagements.

Captain Sartell grimly informs the characters that the star moth is the faster ship and that the Moondancer has no hope of outrunning it. She estimates the characters have about a minute to prepare before the star moth gets close enough to use its mangonel (at long range). Once that happens, Sartell orders her ship to turn about and close with the astral elves as quickly as possible to minimize the Dark Star's opportunity to fire on the Moondancer. It then takes another minute for the two ships to come within boarding distance.

#### DEALING WITH THE DARK STAR

Once the ships are close enough, the three astral elf warriors board the Moondancer, their faces hidden behind visors, and haughtily demand Captain Sartell's surrender. She politely declines, prompting the astral elves to attack while the hadozees use the Dark Star's ballistae to fire on characters they can see. Captain Sartell fights alongside the characters, but Traevus and his thugs, if they are aboard, come to the Moondancer's defense only if it looks like the characters are about to lose.

The astral elves are confident they can conquer the Moondancer, but if two of the warriors fall, the third tries to retreat to the Dark Star. After that attempt succeeds or fails, the star moth beats a hasty retreat. The star priest, Altura, remains aboard the Dark Star and uses a sending spell to relay what has happened to Helix, an astral elf on the Rock of Bral (see chapter 4). The hadozees, meanwhile, are not great fighters and either flee or surrender if the characters engage them in melee.

#### QUESTIONING THE ASTRAL ELVES

Characters who capture and interrogate one or more of the astral elves can learn the following information:

- · The astral elves, by order of Emperor Xavan of the Xaryxian Empire, are responsible for dropping astral seeds on the party's home world.
- · The leader of the astral elf forces in this Wildspace system is Commander Vael. Most of Commander Vael's fleet has already begun sailing back to Xaryxispace. The Dark Star was left behind to monitor the astral seeds' progress.
- The vines and astral blights will feed on the planet's energy and that of its flora and fauna until the party's home world is a dead husk, a process that takes several months. The energy then will be transmitted in a single, enormous burst of light

I4

back to the astral elves' home system to be absorbed by their star, Xaryxis.

- Once the astral seeds have begun their work, there is no way to stop the process. (This isn't true, but the crew of the Dark Star believes it is. The characters won't discover the truth of this matter until later in the adventure.)
#### QUESTIONING THE HADOZEES

The hadozees are mercenaries and have no insight into the astral elves' motives or plans. Even so. they can provide the characters with the following pieces of information:

- . The Dark Star's cargo hold was packed with at least a hundred astral seeds, which were jettisoned one by one into the atmosphere of the party's home world. (The hadozees don't know what the astral seeds do, but they know that each one resembles a crystal pod roughly the size and shape of a coffin.)
- The astral elves hail from a faraway Wildspace system called Xaryxispace.
- · The Dark Star was one of several astral elf ships that traveled to the party's home world. The rest of the fleet has already departed.

The hadozees are willing to serve aboard the Moondancer if they are treated fairly. If she survives the battle, Captain Sartell puts the hadozees to work, though she keeps them under close supervision.

#### PRISONERS OF THE ASTRAL ELVES

If the characters are defeated, the astral elves allow dying characters to be stabilized. The astral elves assume control of the Moondancer while keeping Captain Sartell hostage aboard the Dark Star to ensure Flapjack's compliance. The astral elf and hadozee crew members are split between the two ships. The astral elves then start heading for the edge of the Wildspace system to rendezvous with the rest of Vael's fleet. En route, the two ships might encounter the derelict nautiloid, neogi raiders, or the Rock of Bral navy (all described in chapters 3 and 4), providing the characters with opportunities to escape.

#### TREASURE

The Dark Star is a fine treasure; however, surviving hadozee crew members recommend abandoning it, knowing that the astral elves will rain vengeance upon anyone in control of one of their ships. Its spelliamming helm is a more easily usable prize. It looks like a legless, high-backed chair made of wood, with crystal wings and armrests. Luminous crystals under the seat project a golden hexagon onto the floor; this hexagon stabilizes the helm, allowing it to swivel while holding it in place.

The Dark Star's cargo hold contains enough food and water to sustain the ship's crew for twenty days.

# TRAEVUS TAKES OVER

If the astral elves are defeated and Traevus and his thugs are alive and aboard the Moondancer, Traevus (neutral evil veteran) tries to take the galleon by force before the characters have a chance to finish a short rest.

# TO THE ROCK OF BRAL

Assuming the characters repel the astral elves, the Moondancer resumes its journey to the Rock of Bral. Even if the characters didn't interrogate the astral elves, Captain Sartell has a hunch that the astral elves have something to do with the calamity befalling the party's home planet and says as much. She also mentions knowing someone on the Rock of Bral who might be willing to help the party. If the characters inquire further, Sartell informs them the contact is a giff named Commodore Krux, but she can't tell them more than that since she knows Krux only by reputation.

Enough time passes for the characters to take a long rest. When they're not resting, the characters are assigned miscellaneous chores.

During the voyage, the characters are free to ask Sartell or Flapjack more about Wildspace, the Rock of Bral, or the duo's previous adventures. Captain Sartell enjoys telling of her encounters with various Wildspace creatures (among them a friendly solar dragon and some not-so-friendly space clowns), while Flapjack explains the subtleties of astral navigation. If the party has any spellcasters, Flapjack takes this opportunity to instruct them in the rudiments of spelljamming.

# MIND FLAYERS?

When the characters are hours away from arriving at the Rock of Bral, read:

The ship slows unexpectedly. Around you, on all sides, colossal chunks of rock float in the void. Some of them are overgrown with vegetation, while others are bare stone. Creatures resembling jellyfish and rays glide through the spaces between them.

Captain Sartell looks about uneasily. "Hmm. Plenty of places for pirates to hide."

As if on cue, a vessel lurking behind a nearby asteroid comes into view. Its enormous spiral shell merges with an open bow, beneath which long tentacles wave as if caught in an invisible current.

Sartell sucks her breath in through her teeth and whispers her next words: "Mind flayers."

Here ends chapter 2.

# CHAPTER 3 Preacherous Salvage

The characters escaped their endangered world with the help of Captain Sartell and her ship, the Moondancer, and ran afoul of an astral elf ship called a star moth. After surviving their first Wildspace encounter, the characters resumed their voyage to the Rock of Bral. Along the way, they made a terrifying discovery: a mind flayer ship lurking among some asteroids!

What at first appeared to be a dangerous mind flayer ship turns out to be a derelict vessel. Closer investigation turns up a single member of a pirate crew. In fact, this "survivor" is a psurlon ringer, a horrific predator disguised as a human.

# THE LUCENT EDICT

The vessel is the Lucent Edict, a nautiloid. After the characters sight the craft, read:

As the nautilus-shaped vessel drifts closer, Captain Sartell lets out a sigh of relief. "It's a derelict," she says, pointing out its stripped weaponry and broken hull. "If there were mind flayers aboard, they would've attacked us by now. Looks like somebody's already picked it over. Still, there might be something left worth salvaging."

The sensory input provided by the Moondancer's spelliamming helm interfaces in a special way with Flapjack's Advanced Telepathy, enabling the flumph to sense the presence of telepathic activity on nearby vessels and making the flumph a sort of early warning system in advance of encounters with mind flayers and their ilk. The nautiloid makes Flapjack uneasy, a feeling that stems from the presence of psurlons on board it. At the same time, the psurlons' Alien Mind trait confounds the flumph's Advanced Telepathy. Flapjack has the vague sense that something is aboard the derelict vessel but can't say what. He shares this information with Sartell and any characters with whom he has forged a close bond.

Captain Sartell orders Flapjack to bring her ship alongside the vessel while she designates the characters as a boarding party, instructing them to kill any hostile creatures they encounter.

If the characters balk at exploring the nautiloid, Captain Sartell sarcastically apologizes for

interrupting their "pleasure cruise" and wonders aloud whether they'd rather stay back and swab the decks while she does all the hard work. If the characters still refuse, Captain Sartell makes good on her threat and boards the vessel herself in search of salvage. When she doesn't return, Flapjack urges the party to go and find her, refusing to leave the nautiloid behind until they do so.

#### BENOTO KRALAZAR

Whether or not the characters consent to Captain Sartell's plan, they soon see a young human in ragged, bloodstained clothes step out onto the nautiloid's battle prow. He waves his arms to get their attention and seems to be in distress. If one or more characters enter the nautiloid's air envelope, he introduces himself as Benoto Kralazar and explains that his ship (the nautiloid) was attacked by neogi. He informs the characters that most of his crew are dead, but there are still a few survivors aboard in need of healing, and he begs the party's help.

Benoto is a psurlon ringer (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), a descendant of a group of psurlons that traveled with the Lucent Edict's original mind flayer crew. The mind flayers were attacked and wiped out by githyanki, who disabled the nautiloid and left it adrift. Human pirates found the wreck and tried to plunder it, unaware that the psurlons left behind a hidden clutch of eggs. After hatching from their eggs, the juvenile psurlons began preving on the pirates, killing several of them and forcing the rest to flee. One of the psurlons then assumed the form of a pirate named Benoto Kralazar and has since been using the disguise to lure other victims onto the Lucent Edict.

If the characters board the Lucent Edict, Benoto shows them around the ship while he spins a tale about his crew's harrowing encounter with a group of neogi. The tale is not entirely fanciful-a band of neogi did recently board the Lucent Edict in search of salvage, but they retreated once they realized the nautiloid was home to a bunch of psurlons.

#### EXPLORING THE LUCENT EDICT

Use the nautiloid deck plans in chapter 2 of the Astral Adventurer's Guide to represent the Lucent Edict. The ship shows signs of battle damage and has 220 hit points remaining.

The nautiloid is also missing its spelljamming helm and its ballistae, and its mangonel is broken.

The Lucent Edict has the following features:

- Illumination. All areas in the ship are dimly lit by flickering, bioluminescent orbs mounted to the walls or hanging from the ceiling. Removing an orb from its socket causes the orb to go dark.
- Interior Doors. Each interior door is a fleshy barrier that opens when a creature that has telepathy approaches within 5 feet of it, then quickly closes after the creature and its companions have moved through it. A door must otherwise be pried or tickled open, which requires an action.

The following locations are depicted on the nautiloid deck plans. Locations that are not described below are assumed to contain nothing of interest.

#### 1: CAPTAIN'S CHAIR

An impressive chair is posed at the end of a catwalk so its occupant can look down onto the bridge floor. Green, glowing maggots crawl over the chair's current occupant: a headless mind flayer corpse.

A githyanki knight beheaded the nautiloid's captain and took the head as a trophy, leaving the rest of the corpse slumped in the chair.

Any character who disturbs the headless corpse causes the green, glowing maggots covering it to become a hostile swarm of insects.

Treasure. A character who examines the captain's chair and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a secret compartment in the left armrest. This compartment contains a black metal tube containing a spell scroll of wall of force.

#### 3: SPELLIAMMING HELM

Lying on the floor of this raised platform is the headless body of a mind flayer. The stench of the rotting corpse is unpleasant, to say the least. The dead mind flayer lies in an otherwise open space where you imagine the ship's helm used to be.

The githyanki who attacked the nautiloid disabled the craft by removing its spelljamming helm. They took the head of the dead mind flayer as a trophy.

Treasure. Lying on the deck near the dead mind flayer is an loun stone (reserve). The stone currently holds a single casting of the shield spell.

#### 4: BRIDGE FLOOR

The nautiloid's bridge has a high ceiling. Stairs ascend to a forward observation deck, and toward the stern a ladder climbs to the top of a balcony.

Four psurlons (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) hide in the shadows under the two flights of stairs that climb to the observation platform (area 2). These psurlons attack to kill. If Benoto is present, he helps his fellow psurlons.

#### 6: OBSERVATION PLATFORM

The splintered remains of a mangonel lie on this forward deck, strewn around piles of ammunition.

Amid several stacks of ballista bolts are a few clusters of mangonel stones. If the characters are interested in salvaging this ammunition, assume there are forty of each kind.

#### 10: MESS HALL

The door to this forward compartment has been fastened shut with sutures made of ropes and steel hooks.

A character can cut through the sutures with a suitable tool and 1 minute of effort, after which the door can be opened normally.

The mess hall contains a neh-thalggu (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) that currently has eight brains. The neh-thalggu, kept as a pet by the mind flayers, evaded the githyanki by using its invisibility spell, but it was later trapped here by the human pirates after it killed one of their number.

If a character approaches within 10 feet of the sutured door, the neh-thalggu calls out for help in Common, begging to be freed. It pretends to be a human pirate named Jaspar Graves and claims to have been trapped here by the aberrations that murdered the rest of the crew. (The neh-thalggu knows that psurlons have killed the other pirates and warns the characters about this if they haven't already discovered it for themselves.) If the characters ask

Benoto about the neh-thalggu's story, he dismisses it as a fabrication, explaining that "Jaspar" is a brain-devouring aberration and that the characters shouldn't trust a word it says, nor should they free it.

#### 14: CARGO HOLD

This cargo hold looks and smells like a slaughterhouse. Bodies lie strewn about the deck, and the floor is stained with blood. Most of the bodies appear to be human, but one is an arachnid form with an eel-like neck and head that lies as motionless as the others.

If the characters follow Benoto here, he tries to split the party at this point. He invites one or two characters to accompany him to area 4 (where the other psurlons lie in wait) while suggesting that the remaining characters stay behind and search the cargo hold.

Corpses. The cargo hold contains eleven human corpses. The arachnid form is a dead neogi (see Boo's Astral Menagerie). A character who examines the corpses and makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers that all the bodies have circular bite marks on them, including the neogi. Although several scimitars and crossbows are scattered about the room, the corpses show no evidence of having been struck by them.

The bodies are in varying states of decay. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check, a character can determine that the neogi died within the last 24 hours, and that the freshest human corpses are at least three days old.

Supplies. In addition to the corpses, the cargo hold has enough food and water stored in crates and casks to nourish ten Medium creatures for five days, as well several barrels of pickled brains floating in brine (food for the mind flayers).

Treasure. A search of the human corpses in the cargo hold turns up a total of 23 gp and 117 sp in loose change and a bloodstone ring (50 gp).

#### 17: CELLBLOCK

The rotting corpse of a headless mind flayer lies amid the hacked-up corpses of three hulking creatures with blood-spattered white fur. The condition of the corpses suggests that something or someone has been feeding on them.

Githyanki warriors slew a mind flayer and its three quaggoth thralls, then claimed the illithid's head as a trophy. The corpses are slowly being consumed by the quaggoth in area 19, who survived the githyanki

attack by hiding. Characters who take the time to search the bodies find something of value (see "Treasure" below).

The cells used to contain nine prisoners. The githyanki liberated their kin and put the other prisoners out of their miserv. Characters who search the cells find the remains of three humans, a dwarf, a hadozee, and a plasmoid.

Treasure. The beheaded mind flaver wears a +1 breastplate embossed with tentacles.

#### 19: STORAGE

A terrible stench fills this compartment, but the flickering lights can't reveal its source. You do, however, hear heavy breathing.

A quaggoth hides around the corner on the starboard side of the compartment, out of view of the doorway. Fearing capture, it attacks any creature that enters the compartment.

Stench. Once the quaggoth is dealt with, the characters can track down the source of the terrible stench: the putrescent, mostly eaten corpses of five psurlons hidden under a staircase that climbs to the battle deck. Within these foul remains are dozens of gelatinous, marble-sized egg casings left behind by the psurlon worms that hatched from the eggs.

# NEOGI RAIDERS

The neogi raiders that made an abortive salvage attempt on the Lucent Edict didn't go far. Reasoning that other ships might be attracted to the drifting derelict, the neogi piloted their craft into a cluster of nearby asteroids and waited.

The neogi watch the Moondancer's approach with interest, waiting to see if the characters board the nautiloid. Once the characters leave the Lucent Edict and return to their ship, the neogi spring their trap:

Just as you are making ready to leave, a dark shape glides across the face of a nearby asteroid. It is another ship. The new arrival resembles a giant spider, complete with long, delicate legs and weblike rigging. Starlight gleams off its metallic hull as it creeps silently toward your vessel.

"A nightspider!" shouts Captain Sartell. "The neogi were using this hulk as bait, and we've flown right into their web!"

Here ends part 1 of the adventure. Each character should gain a level before the next session.

# CHAPTER 4 A Friend Indeed

En route to the Rock of Bral, the characters discovered a derelict nautiloid drifting in an asteroid field. Only too late did they realize that another, more dangerous ship was lurking nearby, waiting to spring its trap!

A nightspider crewed by neogi has made its presence known, but the characters aren't forced to deal with any new problems. The timely arrival of a naval patrol drives off the neogi raiders, after which the patrol sees the party safely to the Rock of Bral. There, the characters part ways with Captain Sartell, who encourages them to seek out a giff insurgent named Commodore Krux. The giff brings the characters to his spelljamming vessel, the Second Wind. They set out into Wildspace pursued by Hastain, a deadly ally of the Xaryxian Empire.

Before running this session, familiarize yourself with the Rock of Bral, which is described in chapter 3 of the Astral Adventurer's Guide. When the characters finally arrive at the Rock, you can show players the poster map of the asteroid city.

# NIGHTSPIDER DEAD AHEAD

The neogi ship bearing down on the Moondancer at the end of chapter 3 is a nightspider called the Ebonsnare. See chapter 2 of the Astral Adventurer's Guide for more information on nightspiders.

The Ebonsnare is crewed by eight neogi pirates (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) and twenty commoners of various races and alignments, whom the neogi have enslaved. The neogi also keep two umber hulks on board for use as shock troops during their raids. The nightspider is 250 feet away from the Moondancer when the characters spot it.

The characters likely have little chance of repelling the neogi boarding party, especially if they have just fought off the psurlons hiding aboard the derelict nautiloid in chapter 3. Luckily, a patrol from the Rock of Bral happens upon the characters just in time to save them from having to fight the neogi. Alternatively, if the characters avoided encountering the psurlons or seem eager to test their mettle against the nightspider's crew, allow a group of four neogi pirates and one umber hulk to board the Moondancer, then have the patrol arrive at a suitably dramatic moment during the fight.

#### TO THE RESCUE!

As the nightspider approaches the Moondancer (or after a few rounds of battle, if you decide to allow the characters and the neogi to clash), read:

Suddenly, two galleons glide into view and begin pummeling the nightspider with ballista bolts and mangonel stones, forcing it to break offits attack and make for the cover of the asteroids.

The newly arrived space galleons are the Stalwart and the Incorrigible, both under the command of a lawful neutral githyanki buccaneer (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) named Daar'vik. The Stalwart's crew consists of eighteen bandits of various races and alignments. The crew of the Incorrigible consists of eighteen hadozee shipmates (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) of various alignments. The spelljammer aboard each ship is a lawful neutral, human mage.

Commander Daar'vik, aboard the Incorrigible, is familiar with both the Moondancer and its captain, whom he considers little better than a pirate, though the githyanki grudgingly respects Elaina Sartell's commission. His ship pulls up alongside the Moondancer so that Daar'vik can hail Captain Sartell and ask where the Moondancer is headed. She tells him that the Moondancer is going to the Rock of Bral, and Daar'vik offers to provide an escort-an offer Sartell readily accepts in the wake of the nightspider's ambush.

If the Moondancer appears to be under the control of someone other than Captain Sartell (such as Traevus, the astral elves, or the characters), Daar'vik is suspicious and insists on escorting the ship back to the Rock of Bral. where he has it impounded until the question of its ownership can be resolved. Whether or not the characters allow him to do this is up to them.

If Captain Sartell is compelled to refuse Daar'vik's offer of escort (perhaps because someone is holding her ship hostage or using magic to control her behavior), the githyanki commander wishes her safe travels and sets his ships in pursuit of the nightspider.

# WELCOME TO THE ROCK

When the characters arrive at the Rock of Bral, read or paraphrase the following boxed text:

Sunlight illuminates the rooftops and spires of a city built across the top of a gigantic asteroid. The asteroid's underside has structures as well, including fortresses and giant sails. Wooden docks protrude from one end of the asteroid, and a variety of ships are moored there. Space-dwelling fish scatter in front of you as your ship adjusts its heading until the docks are straight ahead and level with the ship's main deck. Pier workers stand ready to catch ropes and tie off the ship as it glides alongside one of the docks and slows to a stop.

"Welcome to the Rock!" says Captain Sartell. "This is where we part ways."

If she hasn't done so already, Captain Sartell urges the characters to seek out Commodore Krux, a giff who has clashed with astral elves in the past and who might be able to help the characters plan their next move. Sartell knows that Krux can usually be found at the Happy Beholder, a popular tavern.

The characters are free to explore the city. If the party puts off meeting Krux for too long, move the story forward by having Captain Sartell send them a message that astral elves are searching for them. and they need to get off the Rock fast.

# COMMODORE KRUX

Characters who venture to the Happy Beholder can find Commodore Krux there, day or night, nursing a hefty flagon of ale. When the characters enter the tavern, read:

A large, spherical creature with eyestalks and a watchful central eye tends bar in this establishment. Filling one side of a table meant for six is a broad-chested, hippo-headed man with a green parrot perched on one shoulder. The haggard figure squints at you over the top of an enormous tankard, then waves invitingly to the seats across from him.

Krux is a lawful good giff shipmate (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), a soldier who believes his glory days are behind him. Krux has spent the last few years working as a mercenary on and around the Rock of Bral, but lately the giff has been spending more time in his cups as new jobs have become fewer and farther between. The parrot perched on Krux's shoulder isn't his; the bird belongs to Large Luigi, the tavern's beholder proprietor. Luigi uses the parrot to help cheer up downtrodden patrons.

Krux's demeanor brightens if the characters mention what's happening to their home world or start to describe their encounter with the astral elves in chapter 2. The giff leans forward intently, shoves his tankard to the side, and implores the characters to tell him everything. Krux grows visibly excited as he listens to the party's tale; by the end of it, he is willing to aid the characters in their effort to save their world from what he calls the Xaryxian Empire, based on similar attacks he has heard about occurring on other worlds.

Krux is tight-lipped regarding his own history with the Xaryxian Empire as well as how he plans to help the characters, indicating that it is best not to say too much where others might overhear:

"A fleet of astral elf ships visited the Rock of Bral a few days before launching the attack on your world. The elves gave fair warning to various captains on the Rock, urging them to steer clear of your world lest their ships be fired upon. The elves undoubtedly left spies behind to make sure their warnings were heeded. Best we continue this chat aboard my ship."

On the way to Krux's ship, the characters are accosted by four lawful evil astral elf warriors (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) wearing cloaks and visors to conceal their identities. These elves (named Faarfryn, Helix, Kekarion, and Lannis) seek to avenge the defeat of Captain Azmadian and the Dark Star by killing the characters in the streets. Gadaric Main, the proconsul to Prince Andru of Bral, has given these emissaries diplomatic immunity. As a result, there's no one to stand in the elves' way. If he is present, Krux fights alongside the characters but is poisoned for the duration of the fight, due to his drunkenness.

If the characters are in danger of being defeated by the astral elves, a dozen commoners begin throwing stones and food at the astral elves. A few brazen locals even start attacking the elves with sticks and clubs. Realizing they're outnumbered, the elves withdraw while threatening to finish off the characters later.

# THE SECOND WIND

Krux hurriedly ushers the party toward the docks in hopes of making a quick getaway aboard his ship. As the characters make their way to the Rock of Bral's docks with Krux at their side, read:

Stately galleons, sleek cutters that resemble flying fish, and warships built to look like hammerhead sharks line the docks of Bral. Krux waves his arm toward a craft that seems modest by comparison.

The ship's sails are patchworks of mended canvas, while its hull seems barely held together by thick vines that bind it like rope. Its strangest feature is the fullgrown tree that sprouts from the aft deck.

"The Second Wind," Krux declares pridefully. "Isn't she something?"

The Second Wind is a living ship equipped with two jolly boats called Little Boom and Big Bluster (see the "Jolly Boats" sidebar). See chapter 2 of the Astral Adventurer's Guide for the living ship's deck plans and weaponry.

The living ship's spelljamming helm, located belowdecks, looks like an antique chair with golden upholstery and arms sculpted to look like smiling dolphins. The right arm is loose and falls off easily (which has no effect on the item's functionality), and the chair reeks of stale ale. The chair is held aloft and stabilized by green crystals under the seat that project a magical green circle onto the floor.

As Krux and the characters board the vessel, they are accosted by its current captain, Fel Ardra, a chaotic neutral, tiefling cult fanatic who has been

#### IOLLY BOATS

A spelliamming ship can be outfitted with one or more jolly boats, which use the rowboat statistics in the Dungeon Master's Guide. In space, iolly boats are used to cross the gulf between two ships whose gravity planes and air envelopes intersect (on occasions when bringing the bigger ships alongside each other would be risky), or to travel to or from a pier that is either too small or too crowded to accommodate a larger vessel.

A jolly boat can be lowered into the gravity plane of a larger ship or object. where it bobs like a boat in water. A jolly boat is too small to support a spelljamming helm, so the crew must use oars to steer and propel it as it "floats" in the gravity plane. A jolly boat without a gravity plane to float in becomes uncontrollable. though its own air envelope has enough air to sustain one crew member for 8 hours or four crew members for 2 hours each.

renting use of the ship from Krux. Fel is irate at Krux because she still has forty days left on her lease, and the tiefling is preparing to undertake a big job when the party arrives.

#### FEL ARDRA

Fel Ardra is a capable spelljammer who, under different circumstances, could make a comfortable living selling her services to other captains. As it happens, though, the tiefling has turned to smuggling to make enough coin to buy her way out of an infernal contract she entered into many years ago.

Although Krux doesn't approve of Fel's line of business, the giff has had a soft spot for her ever since the two met. Fel sees their relationship as purely transactional, but Krux is convinced the tiefling has a heart of gold, and he keeps trying to persuade her to give up smuggling. Now, with the party's arrival, Krux envisions the makings of a grand adventure, one he hopes that he and the characters can convince Fel to join.

For her part, Fel is indifferent to the party's plight and says that if Krux wants his ship back ahead of time, he'll have to refund the rest of her lease payment, which amounts to 400 gp. Krux says he is prepared to pay her back. Fel, however, can sense the giff's desperation, so she insists on also being compensated for the lost revenue of her next venture, which she figures to be 3,000 gp. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check realizes Fel is bluffing-the tiefling secretly reckons she would be lucky to clear 1,000 gp-but she has always suspected Krux of having deep pockets and has no qualms about trying to gouge him. In truth, Krux has squandered most of his money and can barely afford to return the balance of Fel's lease payment, let alone pay the extra amount she's demanding.

Negotiation is not Krux's strong suit, and the giff turns to the characters for help in convincing Fel to let them use the ship. A character can do so by impressing upon her the urgency of the party's mission and succeeding on a DC 18 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check. The check is made with advantage if the characters refund the rest of Fel's lease payment (400 gp). If the check fails, Fel is unmoved, and further attempts by that character to sway her fall on deaf ears.

If the party doesn't have any spellcasters, Krux points out that they will need to hire a spelljammer. If the party tries to retain Fel's services for this purpose, the tiefling insists on a fee of 1,000 gp in addition to whatever agreement they reach regarding her other demands. If it's obvious the party can't pay what she's asking up front, Fel is willing to accompany them in exchange for a 25 percent share of any treasure they find until she is paid in full.

If the party threatens to take the Second Wind by force, Fel storms off the ship. Within an hour, she finds four veterans who are willing to help her retake the ship. These veterans are armed with pistols (range 30/90 ft.) instead of heavy crossbows. If the Second Wind isn't gone by the time she returns, Fel and her hired guns attack.

#### FLINCH

The first mate of the Second Wind is a neutral good hadozee explorer (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) whom Krux refers to as Mister Flinch. The hadozee is also a skilled seamster; the repairs to the ship's sails are his work. Upon meeting the characters, the friendly hadozee begins offering unsolicited guidance on how to improve their wardrobes.

Flinch is an old comrade-in-arms of Commodore Krux and stands by the giff through thick and thin. The hadozee knows about Krux's history with the astral elves but says nothing of it, replying, if pressed, that "tis not my tale to tell." Flinch has spent the last several months keeping an eye on the ship for Krux while serving in Fel's crew. He is relieved to have Krux back on board and glad to see his friend in such high spirits, though he privately worries that if their upcoming mission should fail, that might be more than the old soldier could bear.

#### STARBOUGH

The tree rooted to the Second Wind's sterncastle is a treant named Starbough, who is largely indifferent to the aims of either Krux or the party. Like many of its kind, the treant considers most Humanoids' problems to be fleeting affairs and takes a much longer view of life.

Within Starbough's reach are ten mangonel stones, which the treant can throw like rocks.

# TO THE EDGE OF WILDSPACE

Once the characters are aboard the Second Wind and safely off the Rock of Bral, Krux reveals his plan to them: to travel to another Wildspace system called Doomspace, where enemies of the Xaryxian Empire are assembling a coalition. Krux believes that the characters' only hope of saving their planet lies in joining the coalition. Krux doesn't know much about Doomspace, though, so the ship's immediate destination is a lonely tower on an asteroid, where a wizard-cartographer named Topolah lives. Topolah is Krux's friend, and he's certain she will be able to provide him with a map of Doomspace. Her tower is at the very edge of the Wildspace system.

Having a new venture to occupy his thoughts lifts Krux's spirits. The giff stops drinking and moves about his ship with purpose and authority, barking out orders like the military commander he once was. Any time the conversation turns to Krux's history with the Xaryxian Empire, however, the giff becomes quiet and brooding. It's obvious there is a painful memory Krux doesn't feel comfortable sharing yet; if pressed, the giff waves dismissively, muttering, "Things are bound to turn out differently this time." (More information about Krux's secret can be found in chapter 7.)

# RUTHLESS REIGAR

Because of their exploits earlier in this adventure. the characters have unknowingly made an enemy of Hastain, a chaotic evil reigar (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) who lives in a small palace on the Rock of Bral. Hastain is a longtime ally of the Xaryxian Empire, which holds a grudge against Commodore Krux (for reasons described in chapter 7). Hastain's spies have been watching the giff, reporting on his activities and contacts.

When word of the recent altercation between the characters and the astral elves gets back to Hastain, the reigar decides to punish the characters for their insolence. Hastain pursues them in an esthetic (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), which trails the Second Wind at a safe distance. Once it becomes obvious that the party is heading to meet Topolah, a wizard the reigar knows by reputation, Hastain decides to put an end to the characters' meddling:

Closing in from behind is a gigantic, bioluminescent, jellyfish-like creature with a flamboyantly dressed figure standing inside its glassy dome.

The esthetic is 250 feet away at the start of the battle and tries to get close enough to attack the Second Wind with its tentacles. The reigar casts dimension door on their first turn, using the spell to board the party's ship. When that happens, read:

A magical doorway appears on the main deck of your ship. The flamboyantly dressed figure steps through it brandishing a trident, and the doorway closes behind them. Sparkling light surrounds the figure. "Heading to Topolah's tower, are we? I don't think so. My friends in the Xaryxian Empire don't want you meddling in their affairs.

"But forgive me, I haven't introduced myself. My name is Hastain. When the elves came looking for a suitable world to nourish their dying star, I suggested yours. It isn't every day I get to witness the destruction of a planet. I promise, it will end beautifullyeven if you're not alive to see it."

Hastain uses Summon Golem on their second turn in combat. While the reigar and the golem attack the characters, the esthetic uses Jammerscream against the Second Wind, then moves close enough to the ship to attack with its tentacles if it isn't close enough already.

#### VICTORY

If Hastain dies, the esthetic uses Jammerscream against the Second Wind if the ship's spelljamming helm hasn't already been disabled.

If the characters win the battle but their spelljamming helm is disabled, read:

You have won a victory, but at what cost? You're stranded on a ship without a functional spelljamming helm, adrift in the vast ocean of Wildspace.

Here ends chapter 4.

#### DEFEAT

If the characters and their allies are defeated, the reigar returns to the esthetic and commands it to demolish what's left of the Second Wind. Enough of the ship's air envelope remains to keep any surviving characters and crew members alive for 8 hours.

If Hastain prevails but the esthetic did not survive, the reigar takes control of the Second Wind and flies it back to the Rock of Bral, but only after jettisoning the characters and crew and leaving them with enough flotsam and jetsam around them to provide only an hour or two of breathable air.

Here ends chapter 4.

# CHAPTER 5 Living on the Edge

The Xaryxian Empire attacked the characters' world, forcing them to take refuge on the Rock of Bral. There, they met a sympathetic giff named Krux. Aboard his ship, the Second Wind, the characters headed to a wizard's tower on the outskirts of Wildspace, where Krux hopes to acquire a map. En route to the tower, the Second Wind was attacked by Hastain, an evil ally of the Xaryxian Empire!

If the Second Wind was disabled or destroyed in the last session, the characters get to the wizard's tower with the help of a pod of migrating kindori.

Once they reach their destination, Krux and the characters hope to obtain a map of Doomspace from Topolah, a reclusive wizard. After defeating a void scavver named Big Momma, the characters seek out a notorious pirate who might be willing to join their fight against the Xaryxian Empire.

# ADRIFT

If the Second Wind is intact and its spelljamming helm is functional, skip ahead to "Topolah's Tower."

If the Second Wind was destroyed or its spelljamming helm was disabled, read the following text to begin the session:

Krux takes a drag from his pipe. "Settle in, everyone. We could be here for a while."

The characters have enough time to take a short rest before the kindori arrive.

#### KINDORI POD

An hour after the events of the previous chapter, the characters encounter a pod of six kindori (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) flying across space along a migration route. The kindori defend themselves if attacked but otherwise pose no threat.

The kindori keep their distance, staying at least 100 feet away from the crew of the Second Wind. The kindori are, however, attracted to lights. If the characters don't think of it themselves, Commodore Krux encourages someone to flash or wave a light to get the pod's attention. Flashing or waving a light causes one or two kindori to approach within 15 feet of the light's source while the remaining kindori keep their distance.

#### LASSOING AND RIDING A KINDORI

A character who has a rope can use an action to try to lasso a kindori, treating the rope as an improvised ranged weapon. Alternatively, a character within reach of a kindori can to try to climb onto its body as an action, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Lassoing or riding a kindori doesn't cause it to attack.

A kindori lashed to the Second Wind with rope pulls the ship across space in whatever direction it is headed. Krux knows the way to Topolah's tower and can indicate which direction the kindori must go to reach it. The tower isn't along the whales' migration path, so a character must coax the kindori into altering course.

As an action, a character mounted on a kindori can try to guide it in a particular direction, doing so with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. This check has advantage if the character has some way to communicate with the kindori (telepathy, for example). If the check fails, the kindori refuses to alter course. If the check fails by 5 or more, the kindori also dislodges the character, who is pushed 10 feet away from the kindori before falling into its gravity plane.

With the help of one or more kindori, the characters arrive at Topolah's tower after 72 hours of travel, after which the kindori resume their migration. If the Second Wind is intact and its spelljamming helm becomes operational before then, Krux orders the characters to release the kindori so the creatures can go on their way.

# TOPOLAH'S TOWER

Topolah's tower is perched on a flat-topped asteroid with an air envelope that extends 180 feet above and below the asteroid and 100 feet away from its sides. The asteroid's gravity plane intersects it horizontally at the level of the docks and the base of the tower.

As the tower comes into view, read:

A crooked tower perches atop a small asteroid, surrounded by a cloud of twinkling cosmic dust.

Through his spyglass, Krux examines the rock upon which the tower stands and the decrepit wooden pier that juts from one side of it. "Mr. Flinch," he says, "ready the jolly!"

If the Second Wind was lost in the previous chapter, characters can ride the kindori to the dock. Otherwise, Krux is concerned about the poor state of Topolah's dock and fears the Second Wind might accidentally smash it to flinders or rip it off its moorings. For this reason, he orders Flinch to deploy a jolly boat while the Second Wind remains 100 feet away, its gravity plane aligned with the gravity plane of the asteroid. Flinch uses a winch to lower Big Bluster, one of the Second Wind's jolly boats, into the overlapping gravity planes of Topolah's Tower and the Second Wind. Characters can use the six oars aboard the jolly boat to propel it to the docks while Krux stands proudly in the bow, pointing to the dock as if the destination were not obvious.

#### APPROACHING THE DOCK

As Krux and the characters make their way to the dock, read:

Scores of pelicans, mollymawks, and smaller birds nesting on the asteroid squawk as you approach the rickety dock. At the end of the dock, two gray, sharklike creatures fight over the remains of a pelican.

A woman with frayed robes and bare feet sits in a rocking chair at the base of the tower watching the fracas, her face half hidden by a wide-brimmed hat that has a blue jay perched on it. The woman leaps to her feet, brandishes a staff, and snarls, "Go on, git!" A fiery ray springs from her fingertip, frightening away the shark-like creatures.

The woman is Topolah, a chaotic good mage. She is elated to receive visitors, especially since one of them is her old friend Krux.

After welcoming Krux and his companions to her tower, Topolah insists on showing the characters her abode (see "Tour of the Tower" below). If Krux or the characters mention the purpose of their visit (to acquire a map of Doomspace), Topolah tells them she'll talk business only after the tour is over.

#### TOWER FEATURES

Aside from its crooked architecture, Topolah's tower has the following features:

Autognomes. When Topolah purchased an expensive telescope from Orwyck Cogsworth, a gnome

TOPOLAH AND HER BIRDS

inventor on the Rock of Bral, he threw in eight autognomes (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) that he built in his likeness, each sporting a dazzling metal mustache. The indifferent autognomes have the three directives common to all their kind plus the following directive: "Defend Topolah from hostile creatures."

Birds. Harmless birds nest in all areas of the tower. Ceilings and Floors. Openings in the floors and ceilings connect the tower's three levels. A magical rope-and-pulley mechanism serves as an eleva-

- tor; a creature need only grab hold of the rope and say "up" or "down" to be hoisted or lowered one floor as desired.
- Illumination. Continual flame spells bathe the interior in bright light. Topolah can suppress or reactivate the illumination on a particular floor by clapping three times while she is on that floor.
- Walls. From the outside, the tower initially appears to have no windows. Topolah can cause an open window (up to 4 feet wide by 10 feet tall) to appear on any wall simply by touching it, or she can make a window disappear with a snap of her fingers. A creature in a window (perhaps sitting on the sill) when the opening disappears is pushed out of the tower a split second before the window vanishes.

#### TOUR OF THE TOWER

Topolah gives the characters a quick look at each floor of her tower, showing them how to operate the rope-and-pulley device to get from one floor to the next.

The boxed text describing each floor of the tower includes information that Topolah gives during her tour.

#### FIRST FLOOR

Four ring-shaped garden terraces line the walls of this cylindrical chamber. The gardens are vertically spaced every ten feet and brimming with luscious fruits, vegetables, and golden wheat. Four mechanical gnomes wearing harnesses tend to the plants. The harnesses are attached to ropes that loop around pulleys affixed to the ceiling, enabling the gnomes to hoist themselves into the air and move from one plot to another.

"Most of my sustenance comes from these gardens," says Topolah. "I get regular deliveries of fresh soil from dohwar merchants, and they get homegrown food and birds' eggs in return."

The four autognomes (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) here are named Orwyck 1, Orwyck 3, Orwyck 6, and Orwyck 8. Their rope-and-pulley harnesses enable them to tend to the gardens.

#### SECOND FLOOR

This floor houses a modest kitchen where two mechanical gnomes are preparing dinner. Furnishings include an unmade bed, a wardrobe topped with bird nests, and a bookshelf packed with astrological texts and more bird nests.

"Here are my living quarters," says Topolah, "where I read my books and take my meals. My autognomes have no shortage of recipes. Today's repast is a deepfried night scavver steak with a lunar béchamel."

The two autognomes (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), Orwyck 2 and Orwyck 4, pay no mind to guests as they prepare Topolah's next meal.

Treasure. Topolah's wardrobe contains an assortment of wizardly garments, including a robe of useful items, and her spellbook, the cover of which is splattered with dry bird droppings. The spellbook contains all the spells Topolah has prepared plus the following: air bubble,* grease, haste, Rary's telepathic bond, and repair object.* (Spells marked with an asterisk appear in the Astral Adventurer's Guide.)

#### THIRD FLOOR

Two mechanical gnomes are using rags to polish a ten-foot-long copper telescope in the center of this chamber. Dozens of star maps lie atop tables that are also littered with sketches of planets and otherworldly landscapes.

"And here is my observatory!" remarks Topolah proudly. "I acquired my autognomes from the same fellow who sold me this telescope, which allows me to spy on all the worlds in this system and gaze at stars in other systems as well."

Topolah walks across the room and touches a wall, whereupon a tall opening appears in front of the telescope. "Would you care to have a look?"

The two autognomes (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), Orwyck 5 and Orwyck 7, keep a close eye on visitors.

The telescope is pointed at the characters' home world. Topolah has been observing the planet for the past several days. Anyone who looks through the telescope can see crystalline vines engulfing the planet.

Star Maps. The observatory contains forty-two maps of various Wildspace systems. None of them depict Doomspace or Xaryxispace (the two other systems featured in this adventure).

Treasure. A Wildspace orrery (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) rests on a shelf. Topolah acquired this magic item from a mercane trader some time ago but lost interest in the item because it makes her feel obsolete.

#### OBTAINING A MAP

After finishing her tour, Topolah is ready to talk business. She starts the conversation with "What brings you to my tower?"

When she finds out that Krux was expecting her to have a map of Doomspace, Topolah reluctantly says she doesn't have one. But to take its place, she is willing to part with the Wildspace orrery she keeps in her observatory. In exchange, she asks the characters to agree to dispose of a local threat:

"A void scavver has started prowling around my tower. I call her Big Momma because she's enormous. I'm surprised you didn't come across her, but then, she can be hard to see-except for her single red eye. I'll give you my Wildspace orrery if you slay Big Momma for me."

Topolah trusts Krux and the characters to make good on their promise to kill Big Momma. Before giving them the Wildspace orrery, Topolah explains how it works:

"This gizmo shows you where you are in relation to the planets, moons, and sun in a Wildspace system, but you must be in Wildspace to use it. To get to another system, you must first enter the Astral Sea, which will take you wherever you want to go. Once you reach your destination, use the orrery to get your bearings."

As they leave her tower and head back to their ship, she wishes them luck saving their world from annihilation.

If Krux and the characters no longer have a ship, Topolah allows them to stay with her until another ship arrives, in which case you should modify the rest of this chapter as follows:

- · Modify the "Oh, Momma!" encounter so that the void scavver attacks characters who loiter outside Topolah's tower or on the dock.
- · An hour after Big Momma is defeated, a cosmic storm engulfs Topolah's tower. While marveling at the storm, Topolah conveys the information in the "Old Flame" section.
- · During the cosmic storm, Grimzod Gargenhale pays Topolah a visit. Conclude with "The Last Breath," skipping over "Gargenhale's Fleet."

# OH, MOMMA!

Ask the players which character has the Wildspace orrery. If none of the characters want to carry it, Krux takes it. With the item in their possession, Krux and the characters can hop aboard their jolly boat and return to the Second Wind.

Have Krux and each character make a DC 21 Wisdom (Perception) check. Those who fail the check are surprised when Big Momma attacks:

As the jolly boat approaches the Second Wind, an enormous jet-black behemoth glides out of the darkness and cosmic dust, its red eye glowing brightly as its jaws open wide. Long, stringy strands of saliva break off into weightless globs as the ravenous monster descends from above.

Big Momma, a void scavver (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), starts the encounter 40 feet from the characters' jolly boat, which is 50 feet from the end of Topolah's dock and the same distance away from the Second Wind. On its first turn, the void scavver swims up to the jolly boat and attacks a random character. Characters who were surprised can't act until the next round.

A character can use an action and a pair of oars to row the jolly boat 10 feet horizontally in any direction along the gravity plane shared by Topolah's asteroid and the Second Wind. Unlike the jolly boat, Big Momma flies through space like a fish through water and can move in any direction.

#### BELLY OF THE BEAST

If slain, Big Momma regurgitates a partially digested dwarf skeleton wearing a fish suit (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide).

# OLD FLAME

After the incident with Big Momma, it dawns on Topolah that she might know someone willing to help the characters further. She casts fly on herself and lands on the deck of the Second Wind shortly after the characters are back on board but before the ship departs.

Topolah offers to introduce the characters to a potential ally, Grimzod Gargenhale. She provides the following information:

- Grimzod is a pirate who has fought many battles against astral elves. Grimzod and Topolah had a tryst that never amounted to much and ended with a peaceful breakup.
- · He has a small fleet of ships nearby and might be persuaded to help the characters.
- · Gargenhale owes Topolah a favor.

Topolah doesn't mention that in the years following their breakup, Gargenhale met his mortal end and rose again as a vampirate. Topolah fears that the crew of the Second Wind might be discouraged by learning this fact before they meet Gargenhale in person. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 (Wisdom) Insight check determines that Topolah is withholding information about Gargenhale and, if they call her out on it, can convince her to spill the beans.

If she's asked about it, Topolah doesn't divulge why their relationship fell apart, but she's quick to point out that she ended things with Gargenhale, not the other way around.

#### WELCOME ABOARD?

If the characters accept Topolah's offer to lead them to Gargenhale's fleet, she attunes to the spelljamming helm of the Second Wind and pilots the ship with precision, grumbling occasionally about the vessel's lack of a battering ram.

If the characters prefer to continue without Topolah, she lets out a wistful sigh and hangs her head in disappointment. After giving Krux the directions to Gargenhale's fleet, she tips her hat at the characters and returns to her tower for a much-needed nap.

# GARGENHALE'S FLEET

Whether the characters head for Gargenhale's fleet or immediately set sail for Doomspace, their course takes them toward the wreckage of a recent battle:

Dead ahead, you see a cloud of debris that appears to be the drifting wreckage of several ships. Krux shouts, "To arms!" Peering through his spyglass, he adds, "Looks like three flying fishes, three lampreys, two squid ships, and two star moths."

Krux's count is accurate. If Topolah is aboard the Second Wind, she recognizes the flying fish ships, lamprey ships, and squid ships-they account for roughly half of Gargenhale's fleet. She is quick to add that Gargenhale's flagship, a space galleon called the Last Breath, is not among the wreckage.

Enough space exists between the wreckage for the Second Wind to pass through the area, which Krux is inclined to do unless the characters advise him to circle around the debris instead.

If the Second Wind passes through the wreckage instead of going around it, the following events occur in sequence:

Crimson Flag. A blood-red pirate flag drifting in space becomes snagged on the Second Wind's ballista.

Drifting Corpses. Two human corpses drift close to the Second Wind. As they bump up against the ship's hull, the figures reveal themselves to be two chaotic neutral vampirates (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) named Dorgio Dali and Vitalia Daggermore. These "survivors" of the battle clamber onto the deck and ask to speak to the captain. They say they're looking for a new commission and are eager to serve. Krux won't have them under his command, however, and orders that they be destroyed.

Scavenging Scavvers. Three gray scavvers (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) pick at the drifting corpse of an astral elf warrior. Wounding a scavver causes it to dart away.

#### WILL-O'-WISP

After the Second Wind passes through or circles around the wrecked ships, an invisible, chaotic neutral will-o'-wisp slips aboard the Second Wind and reveals its presence:

A tiny ball of light appears over the bow of the ship, quickly flies around the mast, and settles a few feet above the main deck, changing colors as it hovers in. place. In a soft voice it says, "Lost, are we? Maybe I can be of assistance."

The will-o'-wisp was with Gargenhale's fleet when the astral elves attacked. It stayed behind after the battle to feed on the life energy of the dying. It offers to guide the Second Wind to the location where Gargenhale's fleet typically regroups. This rendezvous point is a day away.

If questioned, the will-o'-wisp admits that Gargenhale made the mistake of attacking a star moth a while back. Since then, the astral elves have been aggressively attacking Gargenhale's fleet. The willo'-wisp knows that Gargenhale is always looking for new ships to join his force, which is why it wants the Second Wind to travel to Gargenhale's rendezvous point.

# THE LAST BREATH

The will-o'-wisp leads the Second Wind to Gargenhale's flagship. If the characters aren't looking for Gargenhale, he finds them instead. In either case, the following scene occurs after a day's travel:

You are caught in a cosmic storm. Lightning flashes through dense blue and purple clouds, illuminating the silhouette of a galleon with torn, flapping sails. Ghastly mariners stand on deck and cling to the rigging, staring at you with unblinking eyes.

The Second Wind and the Last Breath are 250 feet apart at the start of this encounter. The Last Breath, which is badly damaged, tries to close the distance as quickly as possible. When the ships are within 50 feet of each other, Gargenhale makes his presence known:

The galleon's captain steps into view: a pallid, whitehaired man with a barred metal mask covering the lower half of his face. His left hand detaches at the wrist, skitters up his arm to his shoulder, and waves at you with its fingers.

Krux sneers at this sight and keeps one hand on his holstered pistol. "Vampirates," he hisses.

on Here ends chapter 5.

# CHAPTER 6 Grave Alliance

After acquiring a Wildspace orrery at Topolah's tower, the characters fought a void scavver named Big Momma. After that battle, Topolah mentioned a possible ally in the fight against the Xaryxian Empire: a pirate named Grimzod Gargenhale. Amid a cosmic storm, the characters laid eyes on Gargenhale's flagship and its vampirate crew!

In this chapter, the characters come to terms with Captain Grimzod Gargenhale, who confesses that Xaryxian vessels have all but destroyed his fleet. His badly damaged flagship, the Last Breath, is all that remains after multiple engagements with the astral elves. The vampirate captain nevertheless still vows to destroy the Xaryxian Empire, but unbeknownst to him, his crew is on the verge of mutiny after their latest defeat.

# SHIP OF THE DEAD

The Last Breath is a space galleon that has been reduced to 90 hit points. Unless the characters take defensive measures, the galleon comes close enough for its captain. Grimzod Gargenhale, to be heard. Gargenhale is a chaotic neutral vampirate captain (see Boo's Astral Menagerie). He strikes a dramatic pose as he addresses Krux and the characters, toward whom he is friendly:

The undead captain places his boot on the rail along the deck of his creaky galleon and leans over the bow. His disembodied hand perches on his shoulder, and lightning from the cosmic storm flashes behind him.

Gargenhale's tone of voice is inviting, but his deadblack eves glint with malice. "It's dangerous out here. That menace from Xaryxis, Commander Vael, keeps sending ships to our system, but we do our part to thin the astral elves' ranks. You're obviously not with them. Care to identify yourselves?"

Gargenhale lost his left hand in a sword fight years ago. The hand, which Gargenhale calls "Lefty," was later animated as a crawling claw. The disembodied hand can play instruments and communicate using simple gestures.

If Topolah is in sight, Captain Gargenhale's posture briefly slumps like that of a wounded animal. He then puffs out his chest, raises an eyebrow in her direction, and adds the following:

"Do my lifeless eyes deceive me? Topolah, my darling, what a surprise! If you've come to drive a stake through my heart, you'll have to return it first."

After making introductions, the vampirate captain confesses that his flagship and its crew are all that remains of his fleet. The rest fell prey to ships under the command of Vael, whom Gargenhale calls the scourge of pirates, raiders, and anyone else who refuses to bow to the might of Xaryxis. Despite these cautionary words, Gargenhale tells any belligerent or opportunistic characters that his crew has already died once-and they won't hesitate to do so again in defense of their ship.

THE LAST BREATH

In conversation, Gargenhale is placid and convincing, but his words carry the bite of a vampire scorned. He warms quickly to characters who echo his distaste for the Xaryxian Empire.

#### PARLEYING WITH GARGENHALE

Gargenhale wants to see the Xaryxian Empire crumble, but he's wary of embarking on a voyage to Doomspace alongside a bunch of nobodies. He requests permission to discuss terms in private, either aboard the characters' ship or, if the Second Wind was lost, on Topolah's rickety dock.

Once Gargenhale is off his ship, one or more characters can try to coax the vampirate captain into joining their cause. If one character does all the talking, have that character make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check; otherwise, have all participating characters make a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) group check. If Topolah is present, characters have advantage on this check.

On a successful check, Gargenhale pledges to help the characters save their world from destruction, asking for nothing in return. On a failed check, Gargenhale won't agree to an alliance unless Krux and the characters join his fleet, adhere to the Pirate Code (see the "Pirate Code" sidebar), and call him Admiral Gargenhale.

As the captain of the Second Wind, Krux refuses to bend his knee to a vampirate, but a character can convince the giff to swallow his pride and yield to Gargenhale's authority by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check. If no one succeeds on this check, Krux ends the impasse by offering to step down as captain of the Second Wind for the remainder of the mission, yielding command to any character who can tolerate undead allies better than he can.

When the two parties come to an agreement, Gargenhale bows deeply and invites the characters

#### PIRATE CODE

Grimzod Gargenhale expects those under his command to abide by the following rules:

- Article 1: Don't Eat Each Other. No crew member shall partake of another crew member's flesh or drink their blood.
- Article 2: No Hymns. Many crew members' ears are sensitive to holy praise. While aboard the ship, bards and other musicians are allowed to play only secular tunes.
- Article 3: Coward's Consequence. Those who abandon their post or shirk their duty shall be marooned.
- Article 4: No Shipboard Conflicts. All disputes shall be settled on land.

At your discretion, Captain Gargenhale's code can include additional rules, perhaps of your own design or as suggested by the characters.

aboard his ship to celebrate their alliance with a bottle of Champagne du le Stomp. But before the characters can take him up on his offer, Gargenhale is betrayed (see "Mutiny" below).

#### CREW OF THE LAST BREATH

The crew of the Last Breath includes eight vampirates, a vampirate mage named Rutledge Wynn (who is seated in the ship's spelljamming helm), a dead-eyed ogre zombie, and a tiefling ghost named Agony; see Boo's Astral Menagerie for vampirate stat blocks.

The following rules apply to Agony the ghost:

- · As long as the Last Breath has at least 1 hit point. the ghost can't be permanently slain. If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points and the ship has at least 1 hit point, the ghost re-forms 24 hours later in the ship's cargo hold with all its hit points.
- If it moves more than 100 feet from the Last Breath, the ghost disappears and instantly reappears in the ship's cargo hold.
- While away from the Last Breath, the ghost can use a bonus action to magically teleport back to the ship, either to the lower cargo hold (area 13 on the space galleon deck plans) or a location it can see.

# MUTINY

After negotiations with Gargenhale conclude, but before he can return to his ship, read:

The Last Breath turns tail and flees, leaving its captain behind. Gargenhale's dark eyes widen, then narrow. "What's this foul treachery?" he hisses.

Unbeknownst to anyone aboard the Second Wind, Agony the ghost has taken possession of Flinch. Before the players roll initiative for their characters, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to them:

As Gargenhale bellows a curse at the dwindling stern of his ship, Flinch approaches the vampirate captain with glazed eyes and a dreamy smile. In a voice dripping with sarcasm, Flinch says, "Captain Gargenhale! Your command of the Last Breath is at an end. We've had enough 'victory' at your hands to last ten lifetimes." The hadozee then shudders as a horned ghost vacates his body, cackles, and disappears. Flinch blinks his eyes back into focus, then says in his normal voice, "Do I smell smoke?"

Flinch remembers nothing of what has transpired. Agony the ghost took possession of him long enough to deliver its rebuke, then vanished and took refuge in the Last Breath's cargo hold.

Gargenhale encourages the characters to give chase, saying, "Aboard my ship is a weapon you can use against the Xaryxian Empire! Help me retake the Last Breath, and the weapon is yours!" He refuses to elaborate until his mutinous crew is disposed of.

# GIVING CHASE

If the Second Wind was destroyed earlier in the adventure, continue with "Shipless Pursuit" below. Otherwise, skip ahead to "Aboard the Second Wind."

#### SHIPLESS PURSUIT

Without the Second Wind, characters must use their own magic to pursue the Last Breath before it disappears inside the cosmic storm.

If the characters have no such magic but Topolah is present, she casts a fly spell on Gargenhale. Once a rope is tied around him, he can pull the characters behind him as he, with a flying speed of 60 feet, catches up to the Last Breath, which has a flying speed of 35 feet. Characters pulled behind Gargenhale must hold their breath for the short time they spend in the airless void of Wildspace.

#### ABOARD THE SECOND WIND

Characters aboard the Second Wind can use this ship to pursue the Last Breath, which disappears in the cosmic storm. As soon as he can, Gargenhale gives the Second Wind an edge in the hunt:

The vampirate captain drops to his knees and traces a pattern on the deck with his right hand. A shimmering wave of magical energy washes over the ship. Gargenhale then cackles in triumph, "We are invisible! They won't see us coming until it's too bloody late!"

Gargenhale has used his Ship Invisibility action to conceal the Second Wind, although the effect is not readily apparent to anyone aboard the vessel.

To pursue the fleeing mutineers, the Second Wind must search the storm clouds in which the Last Breath is attempting to hide. The spelljammer of the Second Wind must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check, with advantage if one or more characters are serving as lookouts. The check can be repeated every 10 minutes until it succeeds. On a successful check, the Second Wind finds the Last Breath when the two vessels are 2d6 × 10 feet apart. Since no one aboard the Last Breath can see the invisible Second Wind or its crew, the characters can

close the remaining distance and climb aboard the space galleon, becoming visible only after they leave the Second Wind.

Gargenhale insists on joining the boarding party to retake his ship. If the characters allow him to do so. the invisibility effect on the Second Wind ends as soon as Gargenhale leaves that ship.

#### FIRING ON THE LAST BREATH

If the characters seem determined to fire on the Last Breath from a distance, Gargenhale discourages this course of action:

"My ship is badly damaged and brimming with alchemist's fire. One well-aimed shot could cause her to explode. Better to slip aboard and dispatch the mutineers in close combat."

Gargenhale is not lying about the danger posed by the alchemist's fire, which is described in the next section.

#### BOARDING THE LAST BREATH

The following locations are depicted on the space galleon deck plans in the Astral Adventurer's Guide. Locations that are not described below are assumed to contain nothing of interest.

#### FORECASTLE

Six vampirates (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) are here, waiting to repel boarders. They fight until destroyed, knowing Gargenhale will show them no mercy if they're captured.

#### STERNCASTLE

The ogre zombie and two vampirates (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) are here, waiting to repel boarders. Like the vampirates on the forecastle, these creatures fight until destroyed.

#### 5: SPELLJAMMING HELM

Rutledge Wynn, the vampirate mage, is here. If Rutledge is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, he casts dimension door and transports himself 500 feet into Wildspace, then casts fly on himself and flees.

Spelljamming Helm. The ship's spelljamming helm looks like a black, tall-backed, legless wooden chair with shackles bolted to its armrests. Red crystals sprouting from the chair's underside project a red pentagon on the floor that stabilizes the helm while allowing it to swivel.

#### 13: LOWER CARGO HOLD

This area contains twenty earth-filled coffins, ten wooden kegs painted red that contain gunpowder (see "Explosives" in the Dungeon Master's Guide), and ten wooden kegs of alchemist's fire (each marked with a stenciled green flame).

A keg of alchemist's fire lobbed at a creature or an object deals 21 (6d6) fire damage on a hit. Further, the target is set ablaze and takes the damage again every round (in the case of a creature, at the start of each of its turns) until the fire is put out. A creature within reach of the blaze can take an action to smother the flames using a blanket or carpet, reducing the fire damage by 2d6. Three such actions are needed to fully put out the fire.

Agony, the tiefling ghost, hides here. If it hears the characters approach or open the door to the brig (area 14), the ghost tries to possess one of them. It uses its host to smash one of the kegs of alchemist's fire, starting a blaze in the cargo hold. If this fire is allowed to burn for 1 minute, it ignites the other kegs and blows the Last Breath to flinders. Anyone and anything within 100 feet of the exploding ship takes 110 (20d10) fire damage.

#### 14: BRIG

The door to this compartment is barred from the outside and has a tiny shuttered window built into it. Characters who peer through the window or open the door see the following:

An elf lies unconscious on a cot. She is clad in an ornate black dress accented with silver and gold. A high collar rises behind her head.

If he's present, Gargenhale says, "Here's the weapon I promised you. I liberated her from a star moth we destroyed a few days ago."

The unconscious prisoner is an astral elf aristocrat (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) named Xedalli. She has 0 hit points and is stable. If the unconscious elf receives any amount of magical healing, she regains consciousness but remains groggy and unable to think clearly or take actions until she is aboard the characters' ship or otherwise safe.

# LOOK, A PRINCESS!

If the prisoner hasn't already been roused to consciousness using magic, she awakens with 1 hit point after 1 hour. Once she is awake and somewhere safe, read:

The elf's gold pupils twinkle as she speaks in a superior tone. "I am Princess Xedalli, daughter of Emperor Xavan and heir to the throne of Xaryxis."

Here ends part 2 of the adventure. Each character should gain a level before the next session.

# CHAOS IN DOOMSPACE T

(0 ) =

(c) )

# CHAPTER 7 Trust Issues

To save their world from the Xaryxian Empire, the characters embarked on a dangerous voyage across Wildspace. Along the way, they joined forces with a giff commodore, helped a vampirate captain quell a mutiny, and rescued a princess from the brig of the vampirate's ship-not just any princess, but the daughter of their enemy!

Princess Xedalli reveals that her evil twin. Xeleth. orchestrated the attack on the characters' world in accordance with the dying wish of their father, Emperor Xavan. If the characters help her become empress, Xedalli vows to save their world.

To have any hope against Prince Xeleth's forces, the characters must travel to Doomspace and find Warwyck Blastimoff, Commodore's Krux's former comrade-in-arms. Warwyck has been trying to raise an armada with the help of a mercane arms merchant named Vocath.

# PRINCESS XEDALLI

Xedalli, a chaotic neutral astral elf aristocrat (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), wears a ring of shooting stars and is initially friendly toward the characters. She shares the following information with the characters if she learns about the attack on their world:

"We both want the same thing: revenge. As my father lies on his deathbed, my scheming brother, Xeleth, denies me my birthright. He seized control of my father's navy, banished me from court, and left me in the clutches of his sycophants. He orchestrated the attack on your world, bombarding it with astral seeds harvested from Xaryxis, our dying star. Once the crystal vines have drained all the energy from your world, they will discharge that energy in a beam of light back to Xaryxis, replenishing it.

"Xeleth instructed his minions to deposit me on your world so that, as I died, my energy could contribute in a small way to the light of Xaryxis. Fortunately for me, my ship was disabled and boarded by vampirates. Help me become empress, and I will undo the damage Xeleth has already caused your world."

Xedalli is determined to help the characters, though she admits her motive has more to do with vengeance than sympathy. Understandably, Krux is hesitant to trust a princess of the Xaryxian Empire, but the commodore is willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, if only to gain insight into the empire's weaknesses.

#### ROLEPLAYING XEDALLI

Xedalli presents herself as a rational, compromising alternative to her ruthless evil twin, but she's nonetheless a scornful manipulator who would sooner die than surrender her claim to the imperial throne.

Xedalli knows she must be patient to ascend the throne. Over the course of the adventure, the princess feigns empathy and uses some of her abilities to aid the characters in their efforts while keeping under wraps her most potent magic (such as her ability to summon a solar dragon).

If Xedalli learns that the characters are on their way to Doomspace to join a coalition, she bides her time, hoping the alliance will be strong enough to challenge her brother's claim to the throne.

#### WHAT XEDALLI KNOWS

Given a chance, Xedalli reveals the following additional information, most of which is true:

- · Xedalli and Xeleth were meant to share the throne upon the death of their father, Emperor Xavan. (True)
- . The death and funeral of the emperor are the final stages in his ascension to godhood. His dying wish was that he become one with the light of Xaryxis, when the star is at its brightest. That wish prompted Xeleth's attack on the characters' world. (True)
- · The only way to save the characters' world is to destroy Xaryxis, the star at the heart of Xaryxispace. If the star dies, the crystal vines on the characters' world die as well. (True)
- A member of the imperial family can destroy Xaryxis by performing a ritual at the Astral Font in the Temple of Light, which is located in the imperial fortress. (False)
- · The imperial fortress will orbit Xaryxis until Emperor Xavan ascends to godhood, after which the fortress will return to the Astral Sea. (True)

Xedalli conceals one important fact from the characters: one doesn't need to be a member of the imperial family to destroy Xaryxis, if one has a ring of shooting stars like the one Xedalli wears.

# OLD WOUNDS

After conversing with Xedalli, the characters find Commodore Krux sulking by himself.

## WHAT'S WRONG, BIG GUY?

If the characters ask Krux why he's sulking, he reveals the source of his shame. Long ago, the commodore tried to destroy the imperial fortress in the Astral Sea, but his fleet was routed by the elven armada. Krux's flagship was one of a handful of vessels to escape, though only after it suffered terrible damage from Prince Xeleth's solar dragon mount. Krux lost many comrades that day, and his hatred of the Xaryxian Empire is equaled only by his disgust at his own cowardice and failure.

#### RAISING KRUX'S SPIRITS

Characters can persuade the giff to "buck up" with a successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Those who motivate the commodore with a rousing speech or a healthy dose of tough love have advantage on this check. On a successful check, Krux regains his resolve and stands ready once more to tackle the Xaryxian Empire. On a failed check, the giff sulks in his cabin; when he emerges 1d8 hours later, he is pickled in equal measures of ale and shame.

#### WHAT KRUX KNOWS

If his spirits are raised, Krux shares the following information:

- · He plans to locate his former adjutant, an old giff comrade-in-arms named Warwyck Blastimoff, who left for Doomspace to join the coalition months ago.
- Krux and Warwyck used to communicate regularly by using sending stones, but Krux lost his stone on the Rock of Bral a few days before the characters encountered him.
- When the two giff last spoke, Warwyck was in Doomspace, on the moon of Aruun, entreating sentient plant creatures called aartuks to join the coalition. When he arrives in Doomspace, Krux plans to use the Wildspace orrery to locate Aruun.

# INTO THE ASTRAL SEA

As the characters leave Wildspace and enter the Astral Sea, read:

The colors of Wildspace grow more muted, fading into a deepening silver haze. Soon your ship is immersed in the starry silver clouds of the Astral Sea.

The ship's spelliammer need only think about the destination-Doomspace-to travel there. The Astral Sea takes care of the rest, with the ship arriving at the edge of Doomspace in 21 days.

#### BONDING WITH THE CREW

As they travel to Doomspace, the characters can engage with other crew members. Commodore Krux, Grimzod Gargenhale, and Topolah are particularly fun to be around.

#### COMMODORE KRUX

If he isn't sulking, Krux practices his aim with his firearms, and he invites the characters to join him. Five wooden targets line the port bow, each bearing the poorly drawn visage of an astral elf. Each target has AC 15 and 7 hit points. If a character destroys a target in one hit, the act sparks a rousing old war story from Krux, and that character gains inspiration.

#### GRIMZOD GARGENHALE

The vampirate captain likes to gamble with other crew members in a game called Dead Hand's Dice. The buy-in is 5 gp per game unless the characters are feeling lucky and want to up the ante. The rules are as follows:

- · Each player chooses any number of d6s and shakes them in a cup.
- · Everyone rolls and reveals their dice at the same time.
- · The player with the highest total wins, but anyone who rolls a 1 automatically loses.

#### TOPOLAH

Topolah spends her time making fishing poles and lures, then gives them to characters she likes (see "Astral Fishing" in the Astral Adventurer's Guide).

#### RANDOM ENCOUNTER

The characters have at least one random encounter in the Astral Sea. Determine what they encounter by rolling on the Astral Sea Encounters table, which appears in Boo's Astral Menagerie and on the DM screen, or choose an encounter you like.

# ARRIVAL IN DOOMSPACE

As the characters leave the Astral Sea and enter Doomspace, read the following boxed text:

The silvery haze thins as the ship enters a system that appears to have no sun. The ship glides between colossal fragments of smoky-gray crystal-remnants of an outer shell of fantastic proportions. As silent and lifeless as a graveyard, Doomspace gives new meaning to the phrase "dead of night."

After three days of travel through the labyrinth of crystal shards, you catch sight of a yawning black vortex limned in dim light.

If the characters use the Wildspace orrery they acquired in chapter 5, read:

The Wildspace orrery shows the black vortex with two planets slowly spiraling around it. The system also has twelve moons-one close to the vortex, one orbiting each planet, and nine outer moonlets.

"There," says Krux, pointing at the biggest of the outer moons. "Aruun is just seven days away. With luck, that's where we'll find my old comrade, Warwyck Blastimoff. His mission here is to create unity out of chaos, and knowing him, he's done a bang-up job."

For a map of Doomspace and more information about this Wildspace system, see the "Doomspace" section immediately following this chapter.

# THE AARTUKS OF ARUUN

With the help of the Wildspace orrery, the characters arrives at Aruun in ten days. As the ship approaches the moon, read:

Flashes of light on the surface of Aruun can be seen from orbit. As the ship descends toward the moon, you see a wasteland dotted with pillars of rock. Arcs of lightning leap from pillar to pillar.

The ship heads toward a plateau that is one hundred feet tall, a mile wide, and covered with jungle foliage. Knowing the ship can't land safely, Krux gives the order for the ship to hover just above the treetops, then shouts, "Mister Flinch, drop the ladder!" On that command, the hadozee releases one end of a rope ladder that extends fifty feet to the ground.

The jungle below is alive with the sounds of wildlife. "Who shall join me on the Away Team?" asks Krux.

Krux is eager for the characters to meet Warwyck, so he insists they accompany him to the aartuk camp. Once all the team members set foot on the plateau, read:

A shot rings out. A few seconds later, a uniformed giff bursts through the foliage with a musket in one hand and a look of panic on his face. "Apologies in advance!" he shouts as he makes his way to the rope ladder.

Pellets of radiant light fly through the air, narrowly missing you as several starfish-like plant creatures creep out of the jungle and advance threateningly.

Warwyck Blastimoff, a lawful good giff shipmate. is out of ammunition and in a hurry. The creatures pursuing him are six aartuk warriors and an aartuk priest (see Boo's Astral Menagerie for their stat blocks). The aartuks are hostile and 30 feet away from the characters at the start of this encounter. The priest tries to snare Warwyck with its tongue while the warriors pepper the characters with radiant pellets or engage them in melee.

Once the aartuks are defeated, Warwyck lets out a long sigh of relief, salutes Commodore Krux, and asks, "Permission to come aboard, sir?"

# BULETTE TIME

Before Krux can formally introduce Warwyck to the characters, two bulettes erupt from the ground in the characters' midst:

The earth heaves as two massive, armored creatures burst from the ground. Warwyck shouts, "Bulettes!"

Here ends chapter 7.

# WILDSPACE SYSTEM

# Doomspace

Part 3 of the adventure takes place in a Wildspace system called Doomspace, which consists of two worlds and twelve moons spiraling toward a vortex that used to be the system's sun.

# DOOMSPACE IN A NUTSHELL

Thousands of years ago, a war between gods and primordials ended with all gods being banished from Doomspace. After the war, the primordials encased the system in a crystal sphere that kept the gods at bay.

After being kept out for eons, the gods finally found a way to shatter the crystal sphere, but no one knows exactly how. The destruction of the sphere filled the outermost region of Doomspace with crystalline shards as big as asteroids.

What happened next isn't known for fact, but speculation abounds. Some say the gods appeared before the leaders of Fyreen and Malas and demanded to be worshiped. When they were rebuked. the gods vented their fury by collapsing the sun, leaving behind a spiraling vortex called the Eye of Doom. Those who deny the existence of gods refute these claims and turn to ancient myths for explanation. Perhaps the angry sun was slain by a primordial foe taking the form of a comet, or perhaps the sun was the shell of a great dragon's egg that finally hatched, and the so-called Eye of Doom is the hatchling's hungry maw.

The Doomspace table and the accompanying diagram provide an overview of this Wildspace system.

#### DOOMSPACE

|  |  | Distance to Outer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planet or Moon | Type | Edge of System |
| Valt | Spherical earth | 1,500 million miles |
|  | body (detached | (15 days' travel) |
|  | moon) |  |
| Fyreen | Spherical earth | 1,400 million miles |
|  | body with one | (14 days' travel) |
|  | moon (Crios) |  |
| Malas | Spherical water | 1,200 million miles |
|  | body orbited by a | (12 days' travel) |

|  | dle of ice |  |
| Aruun (one of | Spherical earth | 1,000 million miles |
| the nine moons | body | (10 days' travel) |
| of En) |  |  |

#### LOCATIONS IN DOOMSPACE

The following locations are depicted on the map of Doomspace.

#### EYE OF DOOM

The Eve of Doom is the remains of Doomspace's sun. This swirling, lightless vortex is slowly pulling the system's planets, moons, and crystal shards into it. Each orbit around the Eye brings Valt, Fyreen, Malas, and the nine moons of En closer to the vortex.

What happens to a creature or an object that enters the vortex? That's up to you. Although most creatures in Doomspace assume the vortex is a destructive force, it might be a gate to another dimension, an alternate reality, or another Wildspace system.

#### VALT

Valt was one of Fyreen's moons until it was ripped from the planet's orbit by the Eye of Doom. It is days away from disappearing into the vortex.

#### FYREEN

Fyreen is a volcanic world despoiled by dragons. The planet's remaining resources are hotly contested, giving rise to tyrants.

Temperatures on Fyreen plunged dramatically after the sun collapsed, but the planet generates enough heat on its own to keep it from freezing.

When the sun collapsed, dohwars and mercanes (both described in Boo's Astral Menagerie) evacuated thousands of creatures from Fyreen. Many of these creatures were deposited on the nine moons of En (which provide temporary solace at best) or borne safely to other Wildspace systems. Millions more creatures were left to be swallowed up by the Eye of Doom.

Crios, the smaller of Fyreen's two moons, still orbits the planet. But the same thing that is happening to Valt will happen to Crios in about a month.

#### MALAS

Malas is a water world now sheathed in ice. Its surface is covered with sheer-sided mountains and deep canyons. A moon-sized spindle of smooth ice believed to be a shard of the planet orbits Malas. The spindle is home to a nation of highly intelligent but xenophobic yeti, among other things.

#### NINE MOONS OF EN

En was a spherical air body-a titanic gas giant. It is said that the primordials used the gases of En to help produce the crystal sphere that enclosed Doomspace, scattering En's nine moons in the process.

Aruun. This large moon is home to rampaging tarrasques. Aartuks (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) and other smaller life forms live in the forests that grow atop Aruun's rocky pillars and plateaus, beyond the reach of the tarrasques.

G'vek. This moon is dotted with sheer mountains that have become home to families of aarakocra evacuated from Fyreen. B'rohgs (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), death dogs, gorgons, hydras, and other monsters stalk the foothills.

Inivar. Inivar is a swirling ball of multicolored gas. An intense, flickering light emanates from the moon's core, creating a sort of celestial beacon.

Lesk. The largest of the nine moons of En is a dark desert. Here, clans of ssurran (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) eke out a harsh existence.

Shalar. Shalar is an ice moon with a ring of ice crystals circling its equator. Humans evacuated from Fyreen have built large camps on Shalar's polar ice caps, and dinosaurs roam the frozen landscape, feeding on scant vegetation and each other.

Thrydd. Deep canyons crisscross the surface of this giant ball of ice. The canyons are heated by thermal vents and inhabited by braxats,* gaj,* megapedes, * remorhazes, ssurran, * and thri-kreen. (Creatures marked with an asterisk are described in Boo's Astral Menagerie.)

Vocath. This moon, composed entirely of toxic green gas, is featured in chapters 8 and 9.

Yisheen. This small, barren moon is covered with black frost and belongs to Yisheen, a miserly adult lunar dragon (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) that abides no solicitors.

Yort. This cold, swampy moon is strewn with the petrified skeletons of kindori (see Boo's Astral Menagerie). Humanoid evacuees from Fyreen have taken to building shelters among the bones.

#### SHATTERED SPHERE

Smoky gray shards of crystal, each one a mile thick and hundreds of miles long, float in the outermost regions of Doomspace. These shards are all that remain of the immense crystal sphere that once enclosed the entire Wildspace system. At that time the sphere was thought to be indestructible, though clearly that is not the case. Various kinds of creatures have tried to harvest the crystal, only to find that it can't be chipped or broken by any magic or force known to them.

# CHAPTER 8 Arena of Blood

Eager to join a coalition against the Xarvxian Empire, the characters arrived in Dooms pace to find the system on the verge of collapse. Commodore Krux led his crew to Aruun with the goal of finding an old comrade named Warwyck Blastimoff, who was tasked with organizing a coalition in advance of taking the fight to the enemy!

The two bulettes that appeared at the end of the previous session can be fought, or the characters can retreat to the safety of their ship.

After thanking the characters for their timely rescue. Warwyck Blastimoff informs them that the coalition to defeat the Xaryxian Empire doesn't exist-but that a mercane arms merchant named Vocath might be the key to creating one.

If the characters want to form a coalition, they must first persuade Vocath to call in his debts. The leaders of various space-dwelling factions are beholden to Vocath and therefore willing to listen to him, and they command enough spelljamming ships to form an armada. To gain Vocath's help, the characters must perform in a gladiatorial arena for his amusement and thereby earn the mercane's respect.

# WHAT COALITION?

Once he is safely off Aruun, Warwyck explains the current situation in Doomspace:

"My efforts to create a coalition have been unsuccessful. The factions of Doomspace have little interest. in battling the Xaryxian Empire, which seems only a distant threat to them. They would rather fight among themselves. You saw for yourselves how prickly the aartuks were. My peaceful entreaty must have offended their war gods.

"The only thing these factions seem to have in common is their hunger for ships, spelljamming helms, and weapons-things I can't provide. War is everyone's native tongue here, and the ones most fluent in it are the mercanes. The blue giants are making a killing by selling ships, helms, and weapons to the other factions in exchange for raw mineral resources.

"But all is not lost. I've learned that the factions are in debt to a mercane named Vocath. He might be willing to help us ... for a price."

#### OUESTIONING WARWYCK

Characters who have questions about Vocath can get the following information from Warwyck:

- Vocath the Mercane. Vocath evacuated hundreds of aarakocra, humans, thri-kreen, and ssurran from the doomed world of Fyreen, then sold ships and spelljamming helms to them for next to nothing. All the factions strive to earn his favor.
- Vocath's Base. Vocath has a base that orbits one of the nine moons of En. He has renamed the moon after himself. (The characters can use their Wildspace orrery to ascertain that getting from Aruunto Vocath will take 3 days by spelljamming ship, since the two moons are currently 300 million miles apart.)
- Vocath's Arena. Vocath enjoys blood sports, and his base houses a gladiatorial arena where champions do battle with fearsome creatures that Vocath has transported from Fyreen. Factions send their greatest warriors to fight in the arena to get Vocath's attention or to win supplies, weapons, or both.

# VOCATH'S BASE

The three-day trip from Aruun to Vocath is uneventful, and Commodore Krux spends much of the time catching up with his good friend, Warwyck. Characters who observe the two giff notice that Warwyck's mere presence raises Krux's spirits, filling the commodore with hope and optimism.

When the characters arrive at Vocath's base, read:

Floating above the luminous green clouds of Vocath is a structure made of gray and black stone, with large crystal formations jutting from the underside. Docks radiate outward from a building that is capped by a crystal dome. Several ships are moored here, including a galleon and four others that are shaped like a wasp, a scorpion, a lamprey, and a bird, respectively.

Attached to the main building is a tower that has its own private dock near the top. At the end of this dock is a ship shaped like a damselfly, its metal hull painted bright blue. Flanking this dock are two identical fortyfoot-tall statues, each one depicting a thin, blue, welldressed giant.

VOCATH'S BASI

Crews of aarakocra, aartuks, humans, ssurran, and thri-kreen congregate on the docks near their ships, keeping to themselves as they wait for the next round of gladiatorial games to begin. Seven githyanki warriors (see "Tattooed Guards" below) keep the crews from fighting one another. The guards and the crews are indifferent toward new arrivals.

The docks are numbered 1 through 8 on the accompanying map of Vocath's base. Docks 1 through 7, which are used by visitors, are situated along the base's gravity plane. Dock 8 is the mercane's private facility.

The following ships, each of which is equipped with a spelljamming helm, are docked at Vocath's base when the characters arrive:

- Dock 1. The Skyrra, a shrike ship, has a crew of eleven aarakocra and one aarakocra spelljammer (use the mage stat block, but give this aarakocra a flying speed of 50 feet).
- Dock 2. The Remora, a lamprey ship, has a crew of twelve aartuk warriors, three aartuk priests, and one aartuk elder (see Boo's Astral Menagerie for their stat blocks).
- Dock 4. The Tarrasque, a space galleon, has a crew of humans (one bandit captain, eighteen bandits, and one cult fanatic).

Dock 5. The Gadabout, a wasp ship with a torn-off leg, has a crew of two ssurran defilers and three ssurran poisoners (see Boo's Astral Menagerie for their stat blocks). Its cargo hold has been turned into a ssurran egg nursery.

- Dock 6. The Vrusk, a scorpion ship, has a crew of eight thri-kreen hunters, three thri-kreen gladiators, and one thri-kreen mystic, who serves as the spelljammer (see Boo's Astral Menagerie for their stat blocks).
- Dock 8. Vocath's yacht, a damselfly ship called the Devil's Deal, is moored at the end of this dock. For more information about this ship and its crew, see area 6 later in this chapter.

Docks 3 and 7 are clear of ships. If the characters are traveling aboard the Second Wind and Krux is in command, he chooses to berth the vessel at dock 3. If the characters are traveling aboard the Last Breath and Gargenhale is in command, he chooses to berth the vessel at dock 7.

Krux, Gargenhale, Topolah, and Flinch remain aboard the ship while the characters handle the negotiations with Vocath. Warwyck offers to join the characters and will fight alongside them in Vocath's arena if they ask him to. Princess Xedalli wants to accompany the characters as well, but she won't take part in the arena battle.

#### TATTOOED GUARDS

Vocath employs giff and githyanki guards, each of whom has the mercane's personal sigil tattooed on the back of their right hand. Having this mark allows its bearer to bypass certain security features (see "Magical Effects" below). As an action, a bearer of Vocath's sigil can use the tattoo to cast the message spell, communicating only with Vocath.

#### MAGICAL EFFECTS

Several magical effects are present on Vocath's base:

- Extended Telepathy. Vocath can establish telepathic contact with any creature on the base that Vocath can see or that is tattooed with Vocath's personal sigil.
- Lighting. Vocath's base is brightly lit with continual flame spells in braziers, lamps, and sconces.
- Walls of Force. Transparent, soundproof walls of force separate areas 1, 2, and 3. Vocath can pass through these magical barriers, as can creatures that are tattooed with his personal sigil. Vocath can suppress or reactivate one of these walls (no action required), even if he can't see it. Otherwise, nothing can physically pass through these walls. A disintegrate spell destroys a wall of force; a wall is otherwise indestructible and can't be dispelled.

#### WHERE'S VOCATH?

When the characters first arrive at Vocath's base. the mercane (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) is in his audience chamber (area 4), being attended by his personal bodyguards: Y'thraka, a iovial, lawful neutral githyanki knight with an eye patch, and Sergeant Burt Fluke, a foul-mouthed, chaotic neutral giff shock trooper (see Boo's Astral Menagerie). These two accompany Vocath wherever he goes.

When Vocath decides to stage a gladiatorial contest, he notifies the base's other guards so they can herd spectators onto the arena balcony (area 1). Vocath and his bodyguards then relocate to the mercane's private viewing box overlooking the arena, from where Vocath presides over the spectacle.

If Vocath is in danger, his bodyguards escort him to the damselfly ship berthed at area 6, which the mercane uses to escape from the threat.

#### VOCATH'S BASE LOCATIONS

The following locations are depicted on the map of Vocath's base.

#### 1: ARENA

The arena is a 60-foot-high octagonal chamber with a crystal dome overhead. The floor is blanketed in sand, with a few broken, unusable weapons and chunks of stone here and there.

Balcony. A stone balcony circles the room 30 feet above the floor. This balcony is where spectators congregate to watch arena battles.

Private Box. Twenty feet higher than the main balcony, 50 feet above the arena floor, is a private box where Vocath watches the contests, flanked by his two bodyguards. An ornate throne sized for the mercane is situated here, with two smaller chairs on each side of it for honored guests. Behind the throne, a shimmering wall of force (see "Magical Effects" above) fills an archway that leads to area 2.

Treasure. Mounted to the underside of Vocath's private box, visible to creatures on the arena floor, is a mirror of life trapping whose command words are known only to Vocath. The mercane has trapped the following creatures inside the mirror and releases some of them during the "Arena Battles" event later in this chapter: one braxat,* two b'rohgs,* two hook horrors, one megapede,* one brown scavver,* one gray scavver,* three space clowns,* and one space guppy.* (Creatures marked with an asterisk are described in Boo's Astral Menagerie.) Creatures released in this manner materialize in unoccupied spaces on the arena floor as close to the mirror as possible. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures trapped inside it are released at once.

#### 2: ARMORY

Two walls of force (see "Magical Effects" above) seal off this chamber, where three giff shipmates (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) and three githyanki warriors stand guard. Racks and shelves holding armor and weaponry are mounted to the walls behind them (see "Treasure" below).

Treasure. The weapon racks and shelves hold ten longswords, ten suits of half plate, four muskets, four pistols, two hundred bullets, twenty bombs, and five kegs of gunpowder (see "Explosives" in the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information on firearms, bombs, and gunpowder).

#### 3: VESTIBULE

Stone ramps from the docks ascend to this vestibule, where walls of force (see "Magical Effects" above) block access to areas 2 and 4. Two giff shipmates (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) and two githyanki warriors guard the vestibule.

Visitors seeking an audience with Vocath are expected to wait here until the mercane allows them into his audience chamber (area 4).

#### 4: AUDIENCE CHAMBER

This circular chamber has an ornate throne opposite the entrance, and the walls are lined with art objects, tapestries, paintings, and weapons on display.

A wall of force fills the archway leading to area 3 (see "Magical Effects" above).

Teleporter. While he is in this room, Vocath can take an action to teleport any number of creatures of his choice that he can see in the room to the arena floor (area 1) or to his tower sanctum (area 5).

Treasure. On display are thirty painted statuettes of famous figures from across the multiverse (25 gp each), six blue quartz busts of Vocath displaying various poses and expressions (250 gp each), and eight model ships (750 gp each), as well as four elaborate tapestries (750 gp each) and four paintings of space-dwelling fauna (750 gp each). Racks hold ornate weapons and armor, including a suit of +1 chain mail and a +1 greatsword. Vocath is willing to sell these magic items for 2,500 gp apiece or trade either one for a different rare magic item.

If a creature other than Vocath touches any of the items on display, a mental alarm alerts Vocath, letting him know which object was touched.

#### 5: VOCATH'S SANCTUM

The perimeter of this fifty-foot-high room is lined with silk-draped windows that afford panoramic views of the luminous clouds below and the distant, dark void that was once Doomspace's sun. Soft music plays throughout the room. Low tables are sprinkled around the floor, topped with refreshments. In the middle of each table rests a stout pedestal surmounted by a cerulean bust of Vocath.

An unlocked stone door leads out to Vocath's private dock (area 6). The music permeating the room is created by magic. Vocath can change the music and control its volume at will (no action required).

Teleporter. While in this room, Vocath can use an action to teleport any number of creatures of his choice that he can see in the room to area 4. A creature can negate the effect on itself by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw.

#### 6: PRIVATE DOCK

A private dock juts out from Vocath's tower 80 feet above the public docks. The base of the pier is a wide platform anchored to the tower. An unlocked stone door leading to area 5 is guarded by two giff shipmates (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), who stand between two 40-foot-tall stone statues of Vocath.

Devil's Deal. Vocath's damselfly ship, the Devil's Deal, is berthed at the end of the dock. The ship's crew consists of Vocath's two personal guards (see "Where's Vocath?" above), five githyanki buccaneers, and a githyanki xenomancer who pilots the ship when Vocath doesn't want to (see Boo's Astral Menagerie for the githyanki stat blocks). Vocath has turned the ship's cargo hold into his personal bedchamber.

Treasure. The spelljamming helm aboard the Devil's Deal is a legless chair carved from petrified wood. Black crystals on the underside of its concave seat project a circle of purple light on the floor that stabilizes the helm while allowing it to swivel.

Characters who search Vocath's bedchamber find a folded-up portable hole, inside which the mercane has hidden 500 pp and thirteen gemstones (corundums worth 100 gp each).

# MEETING VOCATH

To speak with Vocath, the characters must first interact with one or more of his guards, who use their sigil tattoos to contact the mercane and inform him of the characters' arrival. Interested to hear what the characters have to say, Vocath instructs the guards to bring them to the audience chamber (area 4), where Vocath greets them:

Vocath, a slender blue giant wearing elegant robes, sits on a large throne flanked by two bodyguards: a battle-scarred giff and a githyanki with an eye patch. Both are clad in plate armor.

"I can't say you look particularly important," drawls the mercane. "So speak. Don't waste my time."

Vocath is cold, smug, and oozing with pride. He knows that all the factions in Doomspace compete to please him. He is as dismissive of emotional pleas for the alliance of the Doomspace factions as he is of anything that doesn't turn him a profit.

If the characters mention the conflict with the Xaryxian Empire, Vocath's demeanor turns cold, since that is not an event he sees as ending favorably for him. If Xedalli is present, Vocath assumes she's either the characters' prisoner or a traitor to the Xaryxian Empire; for her part, Xedalli follows the characters' lead, keeping her identity hidden or disclosing her royal title as appropriate.

If the characters plead for Vocath's help, read:

"Enough with the 'me, me, me, " Vocath says. With a mean glint in his eye, he adds, "I'll arrange a private meeting for you with the faction leaders if you can survive three battles in my arena, with no rest between them. Representatives of the factions will be watching, so fight well. An excellent performance might win their favor."

If the characters agree to his terms, Vocath makes a dismissive gesture, teleports the characters to the arena floor (area 1), and heads to his private box to watch them perform. If Princess Xedalli is present, Vocath invites her to join him in his private box and watch the spectacle by his side-an offer she accepts politely.

# ARENA BATTLES

After teleporting the characters to the arena floor, the mercane instructs his guards to usher spectators out onto the surrounding balcony, where they begin cheering in anticipation of the spectacle to come. Vocath acknowledges the throng from his private balcony. The characters have 1 minute to prepare before the first challenge begins.

The characters roll initiative at the start of each match, and they have no time to rest between matches. Victory in a match goes to the side that reduces all combatants on the other side to 0 hit points.

#### MATCH 1: THRASHER AND GNASHER

Two b'rohgs (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) appear on the arena floor. They stand fifteen feet tall, have burnt-orange skin, and look somewhat befuddled as the crowd screams excitedly.

The b'rohgs have disadvantage on their initiative rolls as they adjust to the sudden uproar and their new surroundings. The rocks scattered around the arena floor are big enough for the b'rohgs to use as ranged weapons.

#### MATCH 2: BRUTUS THE BRAXAT

Brutus, a braxat, is joined by a brown scavver and a gray scavver (see Boo's Astral Menagerie for their stat blocks). They fight as allies.

#### MATCH 3: QUEEN GORMA

Vocath shouts, "Well done. Now prepare yourselves for the Terror of Doomspace!"

Out of nowhere, a three-foot-long, wide-eyed

space guppy appears before you, wagging its tail in a friendly manner.

The characters have a moment to assess their foe-a space guppy (see Boo's Astral Menagerie)- before Vocath realizes, to his dismay, that he has released the wrong creature. Realizing his mistake, Vocath throws his arms into the air and says, "Forgive me. Let's try this again."

Queen Gorma, a one-hundred-foot-long megapede (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) appears, snaps up the guppy, and swallows it whole. Meanwhile, the crowd shouts, "Gorma! Gorma! Gorma!" The megapede isn't a picky eater and targets foes indiscriminately.

# XELETH'S BIG ENTRANCE

When the last arena match ends, but before the characters have time to rest or take any further actions, read:

A portion of the dome above the arena shatters, startling the spectators and causing shards of crystal to fall like rain. A serpentine dragon with scintillating scales and nebulous wings sweeps down through the hole. Mounted on its back is an armored figure whose face is hidden behind a visor.

The figure calls out, "I am Prince Xeleth of the Xaryxian Empire. I've come for my sister, Xedalli. Surrender her to me, you rats, or be annihilated."

Here ends chapter 8.

# CHAPTER 9 Discord and Diplomacy

To build a coalition against the Xaryxian Empire, the characters came to terms with a mercane named Vocath and fought monsters for his amusement. At the end of the final battle, Prince Xeleth of the Xaryxian Empire appeared on a dragon, determined to take Princess Xedalli into his clutches!

The session opens with Princess Xedalli trying to keep her hopes alive while protecting everyone around her from the wrath of her brother, Prince Xeleth, who has Vocath's base surrounded. Xeleth has come for his sister. If Xedalli is either dead or presumed dead, obtaining her ring of shooting stars

PRINCE XELETH

(the symbol of her right to the Xaryxian throne) is enough to satisfy Xeleth, because he can use it as proof of Xedalli's demise.

If Xeleth gains custody of Xedalli or claims the ring as proof of her death, his fleet withdraws from Doomspace, allowing the characters to renew their efforts to unite Doomspace factions against the Xaryxian Empire. Xeleth's attack on Vocath's base is proof of the threat posed by the astral elves, giving the factions a common enemy.

# THE XARYXIAN THREAT

Prince Xeleth is a chaotic evil astral elf aristocrat (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) who wears a ring of shooting stars. After learning of his sister's escape from custody, Xeleth used the power of the Astral Font (see chapter 11) to cast divination. This spell enabled him to determine the whereabouts of his sister's ring of shooting stars.

The young solar dragon (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) that appeared at the end of the previous session was summoned by Xeleth using Summon Solar Dragon. The figure riding the dragon, however, is not Xeleth himself but an illusion of him, created by Xeleth's mislead spell. As long as he maintains concentration on the spell, Xeleth can interact with anyone present through this illusion. If the characters attack the illusory Xeleth or the dragon, the dragon retaliates.

#### STAR MOTH FLEET

The real Xeleth is safely aboard the Xaryxia, one of twelve star moths surrounding Vocath's base. The star moths form a ring around the base while staying 250 feet away from it. Their weapons open fire on any ship that tries to leave the base. (See chapter 2 of the Astral Adventurer's Guide for information about star moths and their weaponry.)

If the characters decide to attack Xeleth's fleet, use nonplayer characters such as Commodore Krux, Warwyck Blastimoff, Princess Xedalli, and Vocath to make it clear that doing so would be tantamount to suicide. Each star moth is crewed by an astral elf honor guard, who serves as the captain; an astral elf star priest, who serves as the ship's spelljammer; and eleven astral elf warriors. The fleet is under the command of an astral elf commander named Vael, who also serves as Xeleth's bodyguard aboard the Xaryxia. (See Boo's Astral Menagerie for the astral elves' stat blocks.)

#### VOCATH'S REACTION

Annoyed that the characters have brought Prince Xeleth's fleet to his doorstep. Vocath does all he can to prevent the characters from dragging him deeper into their conflict with the Xaryxian Empire-first by insisting that the characters comply with Xeleth's demands, and then by discouraging the Doomspace factions from doing anything that might escalate the current conflict at his base. If Xedalli is by his side. the mercane quietly and politely suggests that she surrender to her brother without a fight.

#### ROLEPLAYING XELETH AND XEDALLI

If the characters ask Xeleth why he wants his sister, he replies:

"Our father is dead. When I become emperor, I want my sister present at my coronation."

News of Emperor Xavan's death comes as no surprise to Princess Xedalli. But she knows her brother well enough to assume he's not being entirely truthful about the rest of it. Xedalli clarifies Xeleth's motivation, addressing Vocath and the characters with this reply:

"Not everyone in the Xaryxian Empire supports Xeleth's claim to the throne. He needs me to legitimize it and prevent any unrest that might otherwise occur. No matter. I see that I have no choice but to return home with my brother."

Xeleth doesn't deny his sister's accusation, nor do her words change the present situation. Xedalli sees no better option than to accompany her brother back to Xaryxispace. As the encounter unfolds, however, she uses the same trick as Xeleth: she casts mislead, turning invisible while creating an illusory duplicate of herself. While invisible, Xedalli addresses the characters through her illusion and praises them for their heroic attitude while discouraging them from getting involved in Xaryxian politics. While her illusion chatters on, Xedalli surreptitiously removes her ring of shooting stars, drops it on the sandy arena floor, and uses a sending spell to communicate the following information to a character she can trust to act on it:

"You'll need my ring to save your world. I've dropped the ring in the sand. Keep it safe. I'll be waiting for you in Xaryxispace."

After giving up her ring, Xedalli moves back into the space occupied by her illusory image and ends her mislead spell, making it seem like she was there the whole time.

After parting with her ring, Xedalli surrenders to her brother. If Xeleth's solar dragon is still around, it bears her safely to the Xaryxia, where she is taken into custody. If the characters defeated Xeleth's dragon, Xedalli travels to her brother's ship on the back of another solar dragon she summons for herself. After his sister is aboard the Xaryxia, Xeleth orders his fleet back to Xaryxispace. As long as Xedalli is his prisoner, Xeleth doesn't care about what happens to her ring.

If he thinks Xedalli is dead. Xeleth assumes the characters have her ring and demands that it be tossed into his dragon's mouth (so that the dragon can safely transport it back to Xeleth's ship). If his dragon is defeated before it can deliver the ring, Xeleth orders Commander Vael to teleport to Vocath's base with eight astral elf warriors, obtain the ring at any cost, and teleport back to the Xaryxia. Vocath, if he's alive, helps the astral elves retrieve the ring. He hopes they'll leave in peace afterward, which they do.

#### XELETH DENIED

If Xeleth is unable to obtain Xedalli or her ring, his fleet opens fire on the ships docked at Vocath's base. (These ships are detailed in chapter 8). After 5 rounds of bombardment, the following ships are destroyed before their crews can mount a defense: the Skyrra, the Remora, the Vrusk, the Tarrasque, and the Gadabout.

Neither the characters' ship nor the Devil's Deal (Vocath's damselfly ship) is damaged in the initial bombardment. But if either ship tries to leave Vocath's base, the astral elves unleash their next flurry of ballista bolts and mangonel stones against the fleeing ship.

After the astral elves' initial bombardment, Vocath casts dimension door and boards Xeleth's flagship to negotiate an end to the conflict. If Xedalli is nearby, the mercane takes her along, and together they work out a deal in which Xedalli surrenders to Xeleth and the astral elves leave without further incident.

If Vocath isn't around to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict, Xeleth's fleet docks at the base and deploys troops once it's safe to do so. Enemy leaders are rounded up and executed, and any hope of forming a coalition among the Doomspace factions is lost. (Skip over the "Alliance in Doomspace" and "Assemble the Fleet!" sections.) When the characters are ready to leave Doomspace, continue with the "Red Dragon Rider" section at the end of the chapter.

# ALLIANCE IN DOOMSPACE

After Xeleth is placated and his fleet withdraws from Doomspace. Vocath arranges a gathering in his private sanctum (area 5 of Vocath's base, as described in chapter 8). This meeting is attended by the characters and representatives of the five Doomspace factions. Vocath and his bodyguards are also here, observing the proceedings in silence.

To forge a coalition, the characters must redirect the factions' animosity toward the Xaryxian Empire. The representatives with whom they must speak are summarized in the Faction Representatives table.

#### FACTION REPRESENTATIVES

| Representative | Faction |
| --- | --- |
| Dakaer (neutral, human bandit captain) | Human |
| Rika (neutral good aarakocra) | Aarakocra |
| Takana (chaotic neutral thri-kreen mystic *) | Thri-kreen |
| Vortshu (chaotic neutral aartuk elder*) | Aartuk |
| Zoth'ess (neutral ssurran defiler*) | Ssurran |

*See Boo's Astral Menagerie for statistics.

#### FORMING A COALITION

A faction's attitude toward the party depends on what the characters have accomplished:

- · Two of the factions (determined by you) are friendly toward the characters by virtue of their victory in the arena battles. The remaining three factions are indifferent toward the characters.
- . If the characters did anything to antagonize a faction, that faction is hostile toward them, regardless of their performance in the arena battles.
- · The characters can improve a faction's attitude toward them by influencing that faction's representative (see the "Faction Representatives" section below). The best the characters can hope for is to align the factions against their common enemy, the Xaryxian Empire.

To convince a faction to join the coalition, a character must make a case to the faction's representative and succeed on a Charisma check using Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion, as befits the approach. Another character can use the Help action to grant advantage on the check, but only if that character makes a meaningful contribution to the conversation. The difficulty of the check depends on the faction's attitude toward the characters: DC 20 if hostile, DC 15 if indifferent, or DC 10 if friendly.

On a successful check, the faction joins the coalition. On a failed check, the representative declines to join the coalition, and the characters can't change that representative's mind until they convince another faction to join the coalition (discounting any

factions that have already joined). The "Vortshu and Takana at Vocath" sidebar shows these rules in play.

#### FACTION REPRESENTATIVES

Each faction leader is described below.

#### DAKAER

Human Representative

Dakaer commands the Tarrasque, a space galleon. He often sounds terse, even when he is speaking unemotionally. He and his crew dress plainly and wield weapons made from bone.

War is not something Dakaer longs for, but he seeks to acquire better weaponry nonetheless. His crew also clamors for healing kits, tools, and musical instruments.

Attitude Adjustment. The characters can improve the attitude of the human faction by one step if thev offer Dakaer a worthy gift, such as one of the following items:

- · A set of artisan's tools or navigator's tools
- · A healing kit or potion of healing
- · A musical instrument
- · A magic weapon

#### RIKA

#### Aarakocra Representative

Rika is the oldest crew member of the shrike ship Skyrra and chief advisor to its captain, Kree'esh.

Rika's faction is concerned about personal freedom. Rika looks forward to guiding his people to a new Wildspace system where they can thrive.

#### VORTSHU AND TAKANA AT VOCATH

The following is an example of the "Forming a Coalition" rules in play.

A character approaches Vortshu, the aartuk elder (who is indifferent toward them), and tries to convince Vortshu that war against the Xaryxian Empire would elevate aartuks in the eyes oftheir gods. It's a sound approach, given aartuks' devotion to gods of war. But the character gets a failure on their DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, so Vortshu refuses to join the coalition, perhaps making the argument that the thrikreen are a greater threat to the aartuks than the Xaryxian Empire. Further attempts to sway Vortshu fail automatically until the characters convince another faction representative to join their coalition. Having previously won over the aarakocra, the characters now set their sights on Takana, the thri-kreen representative.

Like Vortshu, Takana is indifferent toward the characters. To improve Takana's attitude, the characters give her the spelljamming helm they took from the Dark Star in chapter 2. This fabulous gift is enough to improve Takana's attitude to friendly. A character then succeeds on the DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, convincing Takana to join their coalition. With the thri-kreen now on board, the characters can make another attempt to convince Vortshu to join the coalition.

Attitude Adjustment. Characters can improve the attitude of the aarakocra faction to friendly if they offer Rika a worthy gift, such as one of the following items:

- · The Wildspace orrery acquired from Topolah
- · A navigational chart for another Wildspace system

#### TAKANA

#### Thri-kreen Representative

Takana serves as the spelljammer aboard the scorpion ship Vrusk and is keen to acquire more spelliamming helms and food supplies for her faction. She admits that the thri-kreen have taken to eating aartuks because of the scarcity of food in Doomspace (which hasn't endeared the thri-kreen to the aartuk faction).

Attitude Adjustment. Characters can improve the attitude of the thri-kreen faction to friendly if thev offer Takana a worthy gift, examples of which are as follows:

- · A spelljamming helm
- · At least 30 days' worth of food

#### VORTSHU

#### Aartuk Representative

Vortshu, the captain of the lamprey ship Remora, is a warmonger who instigated a conflict with the thrikreen. The thri-kreen have since acquired a taste for aartuk flesh. Characters can appeal to Vortshu's adversarial nature to win his support.

Attitude Adjustment. A character can improve the attitude of the aartuk faction to friendly in one of the following ways:

- · By challenging the thri-kreen representative to a duel (which Takana declines, but the challenge alone is enough to win over Vortshu)
- · By defeating Vortshu in a wrestling match, which requires the character to succeed on three DC 14 Strength (Athletics) checks before failing three of those checks

#### ZOTH'ESS

#### Ssurran Representative

The ssurran of Fyreen are acclimating to life in Wildspace. Their leader, Zoth'ess, commands the wasp ship Gadabout.

Zoth'ess needs money to repair her ship's broken leg and pay off debts to Vocath. She demands treasure in exchange for her support.

Attitude Adjustment. Characters can improve the attitude of the ssurran faction by one step if they offer Zoth'ess a worthy gift, examples of which are as follows:

- · At least 500 gp in coins, gems, or art objects
- · A magic item of uncommon rarity or better

# ASSEMBLE THE FLEET!

Each faction that joins the coalition brings a certain number of ships to it, as summarized in the Coalition Fleet table.

If the characters convince at least four factions to join the coalition, Vocath decides their cause is worth supporting and telepathically reaches out to some of his mercane allies, who send additional ships. These ships come with their own spelljamming helms and crews. The mercane ships have crews pulled from different factions. The mercanes themselves stay out of the fight.

It takes ten days for the coalition fleet to assemble, during which time the characters can rest and make any final preparations before heading to Xaryxispace.

#### COALITION FLEET

| Faction | Ships |
| --- | --- |
| Aarakocra | 5 shrike ships, including the Skyrra |
| Aartuks | 5 lamprey ships, including the Remora |
| Humans | 3 space galleons, including the Tarrasque |
| Mercanes | 2 hammerhead ships (one crewed by hu- |
|  | mans, the other by thri-kreen) and 5 squid |
|  | ships (each one crewed by members of a |
|  | different faction) |
| Ssurran | 6 wasp ships, including the Gadabout |
| Thri-kreen | 4 scorpion ships, including the Vrusk |

# RED DRAGON RIDER

From now on, the adventure makes no assumption about which ship the characters are traveling on, but it is important for the characters to be together.

A few hours after they return to the Astral Sea, the characters have the following encounter:

The silvery fog catches the light of distant stars and coalesces into clouds that vaguely resemble faces as inscrutable as they are enormous. Perhaps these are the visages of gods watching over you, or perhaps they are merely figments of the Astral Plane-stray thoughts given form.

None of that matters, however, as a distant roar draws your attention to one of the cloudy visages, from whose mouth emerges a large red dragon. Riding the dragon is a knight clad in golden armor, their face hidden behind a fearsome visor shaped like a dragon's scowling visage!

Here ends part 3 of the adventure. Each character should gain a level before the next session.

# SAVIORS OF THE MULTIVERSE und

e and

# CHAPTER 10 Space Invaders

After the Xaryxian Empire attacked their world, the characters journeyed to Doomspace and formed a coalition. With a fleet of ships accompanying them, they set out for Xaryxispace, encountering a red dragon and its rider along the way!

Dagaz, a githyanki knight, is hunting mind flayers in the Astral Sea. Dagaz and her dragon mount fight only in self-defense and are, at best, a fleeting distraction. The real trouble begins when the characters enter Xaryxispace and make their way to the imperial citadel of the Xaryxian Empire, which is protected by a fleet of star moths.

# KNIGHT OF TU'NARATH

A lawful evil githyanki knight named Dagaz rides a male young red dragon. These creatures begin the encounter 500 feet from the characters' ship.

Dagaz and the dragon are initially indifferent toward the characters. If the dragon is not attacked right away, it circles the characters' ship once as it identifies a safe place to land, then lands gently on the deck. Dagaz casts tongues on herself and addresses the characters moments later:

The armored knight lifts the visor of her helm, revealing the stern visage of a githyanki. "I am Dagaz, a knight of Tu'narath," she says in a haughty tone. "By order of Vlaakith the Undying, Queen of the Astral Sea, I declare that you are guilty of the crime of trespassing. As your punishment, it is my solemn duty to decapitate your captain. So, which one of you dung-eaters commands this barge?"

After a beat, Dagaz smiles and adds:

"A bad joke on my part. I wish you swift passage through Her Majesty's realm. My dragon and I are hunting mind flayers. Have you seen any?"

If the characters attack the knight or the dragon, the dragon retaliates by burning their ship with its Breath Weapon. If she takes any damage, Dagaz uses misty step to board the vessel and goes after whoever is responsible.

If the characters refrain from combat and inform Dagaz that they've encountered no mind flayers, she takes them at their word and bids them a safe journey to wherever they're going. If the characters inform Dagaz of their destination, she tosses one of them a vial containing oil of sharpness and says, "Give the Xaryxian Empire my regards." She and the dragon then fly away.

# ARRIVAL IN XARYXISPACE

When the characters enter Xaryxispace, read:

You emerge from the silver haze of the Astral Sea and enter a Wildspace system illuminated by a white star.

Using the Wildspace orrery, the characters can plot a course to the imperial citadel of the Xaryxian Empire, which is connected to Xaryxis by a beam of light 300 million miles long. The characters are 100 million miles (1 day's travel by spelljamming ship) from the imperial citadel when their fleet enters Xaryxispace. If the characters no longer have the Wildspace orrery, they can fly toward the star until they see the beam of light and follow it to the imperial citadel.

For a map of Xaryxispace and more information about this Wildspace system, see the "Xaryxispace" section immediately following this chapter.

# ATTACKING THE CITADEL

When the characters come within 1 mile of the imperial citadel, read:

Ahead, you see an elegant, crystal-spired city built on the back of an asteroid shaped like a moth, with shipyards sprouting from its wings. Atop the moth's head stands a magnificent temple. A beam of light stretches from a crystal atop the temple toward the bright white star, Xaryxis.

An armada of crystal-winged ships patrols the region between your fleet and the citadel. The closest enemy ship is about a thousand feet away.

The Xaryxian armada is not expecting an attack. Allow the characters to decide whether they want to open the engagement at range or close to boarding

distance. In either case, the Xaryxian ships are surprised at the beginning of combat.

#### THE XARYXIAN ARMADA

The enemy armada consists of thirty star moths, each one crewed by an astral elf honor guard, who serves as the captain: an astral elf star priest, who serves as the ship's spelljammer; and eleven astral elf warriors. The armada's flagship, the Xaryxia, also carries an astral elf commander named Vael, who commands the entire fleet. See Boo's Astral Menagerie for the astral elves' stat blocks.

When the two fleets meet in battle, the Xaryxia singles out the characters' ship while the rest of the armada engages the other ships in the characters' fleet. The Xaryxia and the characters' ship are 1,000 feet apart at the start of the encounter.

Given the number of ships and combatants on both sides, it is impractical to track everyone's movements and actions. Instead, narrow the focus of the conflict to the characters' ship and the Xaryxia. In between actions, you can narrate glimpses of what's going on in the larger battle-for example, stray ballista bolts whizzing past the characters' ship or an aartuk lamprey ship clamping onto a passing star moth.

Although the Xaryxian ships are united in their determination to defend the imperial citadel, the crews have different political loyalties, as discussed in the "Loyalty to Xedalli or Xeleth?" sidebar.

#### BATTLE LOSSES

Each round on initiative count 0, the Doomspace coalition and the Xaryxian armada each lose one ship and its crew, in addition to any ships and crews defeated by the characters. Keep track of how many ships are left in the battle at the start of each round.

#### LOYALTY TO XEDALLI OR XELETH?

The crew of the Xaryxia is loyal to Prince Xeleth, but not all ships in the Xaryxian armada share that loyalty. To determine the political leanings of another star moth's crew, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-3, the crew is loyal to Xeleth. On a roll of 4-6, the crew is loyal to Xedalli. Regardless of a crew's loyalty, no ship in the Xaryxian armada can be used to attack another Xaryxian vessel unless it has been commandeered by an enemy.

A character who shows Xedalli's ring of shooting stars to one or more crew members of a ship loyal to Xedalli can, with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, improve the attitude of that crew, changing it from hostile to indifferent, by claiming to be acting on Xedalli's behalf. Xedalli's ring looks no different from her brother's, but a successful check is enough to convince the crew that the ring was entrusted to the characters by the princess. An indifferent crew breaks off its attack on the characters' ship but won't aid the characters in any other way.

#### HERE THERE BE DRAGONS

Seven young solar dragons (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), born in the fiery heart of Xaryxis, fly around the beam of light that extends between the imperial citadel to the star. After noticing the battle, they join the fray, arriving just as the characters finish dealing with Commander Vael's flagship:

Seven dragons with multicolored scales and gaseous wings slither through Wildspace with their mouths agape like hungry serpents. Two of them break off from the others and head toward your ship.

Two of the seven solar dragons fly toward the party's vessel while the remaining dragons harry other ships in the coalition fleet or scour the wrecks for treasure.

The two dragons are 1,000 feet from the characters' ship when they are spotted. Both dragons close the distance. One targets characters while the other targets the ship and its weapons. If either dragon is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, it flees. The dragons also break off their assault if a character stands on the deck of their ship and brandishes Xedalli's ring of shooting stars; the dragons have been trained since birth not to harm anyone bearing such a ring.

# FINAL APPROACH

Even if the characters survive the Xaryxia and the two solar dragons, it becomes obvious that the rest of their fleet is doomed. In response, they can fight on, surrender, or make a break for the citadel.

If the characters surrender to the astral elves or are defeated, read:

You watch as your allies lay down their arms and surrender. Now prisoners of the Xaryxian Empire, you are taken to the imperial citadel to face justice. Maybe this was your plan for getting into the citadel all along. Maybe not. Either way, all is not lost.

If the characters avoid capture and make a break for the citadel, read the following text instead:

The imperial citadel looms large, its crystal spires reflecting the light of Xaryxis. It is here, in the heart of the Xaryxian Empire, that you will decide the fate of your world.

Here ends chapter 10.

# WILDSPACE SYSTEM Xaryxispace

Part 4 of the adventure takes place in a Wildspace system under the control of the Xaryxian Empire.

# XARYXISPACE IN A NUTSHELL

Xaryxis is a white-hot star that is both the literal and figurative heart of the astral elves' empire. The astral elves discovered how to harness the star's power, using it to fuel their magic. When, after thousands of years of exploitation, Xaryxis's light began to dim, the astral elves began harvesting astral seeds from the star to tap the energy of other celestial bodies and use it to replenish the strength of their star.

Xaryxispace is a small Wildspace system, consisting only of its central star and three natural satellites, plus a floating citadel constructed by the astral elves of the Xaryxian Empire, who are the system's primary inhabitants. The Xaryxispace table and the accompanying diagram provide an overview of this system.

#### XARYXISPACE

| Planet or |  | Distance to Outer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structure | Type | Edge of System |
| Vaerduran | Irregular earth | 600 million miles |
|  | body | (6 days' travel) |
| Rivus | Spherical earth | 500 million miles |
|  | body | (5 days' travel) |
| Xaryndar | Spherical earth | 400 million miles |
|  | body with one | (4 days' travel) |
|  | moon (Eysix) |  |
| Imperial Citadel City in space |  | 400 million miles |
|  |  | (4 days' travel) |

#### LOCATIONS IN XARYXISPACE

The following locations are depicted on the map of Xaryxispace.

#### VAERDURAN

This rocky, misshapen world once supported life, but its ecosystem was wiped out when it became the astral elves' first testing ground for their newly harvested astral seeds. Cracked and barren, this planet is now little more than a cinder.

#### RIVUS

Another rocky world, Rivus escaped Vaerduran's fate because of its rich platinum deposits, which the astral elves mine. Although it appears desolate on the surface, Rivus bustles with activity belowground, where umber hulks, purple worms, and other burrowing creatures make their lairs.

#### XARYNDAR

Xaryndar is a lush, green planet that teems with life. The flora of the world grow to extraordinary size thanks to the light of Xaryxis, and many of the planet's most formidable creatures are various kinds of intelligent plants. Most of Xaryndar's elf population left long ago to be closer to their gods on the Astral Plane, but the planet still has a few settlements that cultivate and harvest the crystal-leaf trees used in the construction of star moths.

#### IMPERIAL CITADEL

The imperial citadel is the administrative heart of the Xaryxian Empire and is described more fully in the "Citadel Overview" section.

DYSON LOGOS

# CITADEL OVERVIEW

The imperial citadel is the seat of the imperial family, which includes Emperor Xavan and his heirs. Princess Xedalli and Prince Xeleth. The citadel is a mile-wide, floating platform of hewn stone shaped in the form of a moth. See the accompanying map for the citadel's layout.

The citadel, which has its own air envelope and gravity plane, is home to approximately 10,000 people, most of them astral elves. The few non-elves are diplomatic envoys to the court, traders, and skilled crafters whose work is esteemed by the emperor.

The imperial guard, which provides security within the palace and throughout the citadel, is composed of 150 astral elf warriors and 30 astral elf honor guards (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) of various alignments, with half that number on duty at any given time.

No structures are built on the underside of the citadel, which is dotted with natural rocky protrusions. On the topside, stone walls 20 feet thick and 40 feet high control access to the gardens, the imperial palace, the Great Orrery, and the docks. Sixty-foottall stone towers built into the walls are topped with ballistae and mangonels.

#### REGIONS

The citadel is made up of the following regions.

#### COMMON DOCKS

These docks are used by ships belonging to tradespeople, visitors, private citizens, and mercenaries. Much of the traffic at the common docks consists of cargo vessels delivering food and other supplies.

#### GARDENS

The citadel's gardens are trimmed and cultivated to represent an idyllic vision of Xaryndar's forests. The greenery replenishes the citadel's air envelope and serves as a bucolic refuge. Discreet conversation away from the prying eyes of the court often takes place here.

#### GREAT ORRERY

The Great Orrery is the center of scholarship in the citadel. Enclosed by high walls, the facility is built around a gigantic orrery of Xaryxispace. This magical and mechanical contraption features levitating models of the system's planets and moons, all orbiting a brightly glowing crystal orb that represents Xaryxis.

A lawful evil, astral elf archmage named Magister Theraxana is here day and night, studying Wildspace systems that have been surveyed by astral elf explorers and looking for new worlds that can be exploited to keep Xaryxis burning bright.

A chamber beneath the Great Orrery contains a ring of twelve spelljamming helms joined together by crystal filaments. Theraxana and her fellow mages use these spelljamming helms to move the citadel across Wildspace and the Astral Sea, in accordance with the wishes of the emperor. All twelve helms are required to propel the citadel, which has a flying speed of 50 feet (51/2 mph).

#### HIGH QUARTER

This region is where the palace's courtiers and trusted servants maintain their residences. A handful of shops and other establishments that cater to members of the court are also located here.

#### IMPERIAL DOCKS

Only ships belonging to the imperial family-which includes the imperial navy as well as an assortment of pleasure craft-are allowed to dock here. Guards patrol the imperial docks constantly.

#### IMPERIAL PALACE

From the upper floors of this stone and crystal palace, the ruling family has a commanding view of the vista that stretches out below. Including courtiers, guards, and servants, over a thousand people are in the palace at any time.

#### LOW QUARTER

The citadel's laborers and servants have dwellings in the low quarter. Here, too, are relatively cheap lodgings for visitors.

#### MILITARY QUARTER

Members of the imperial navy and the imperial guard maintain residences in the military quarter. Most members of the guard can be found here when they are not on duty.

#### TEMPLE OF LIGHT

The Temple of Light is where the light of Xaryxis is harnessed for the astral elves' use. Atop the temple is a giant crystal that receives and focuses the star's light and channels that energy into a pool in the center of the temple called the Astral Font, which powers the empire's most potent magic. Andavier, a lawful neutral astral elf star priest (see Boo's Astral Menagerie), oversees the temple.

More information about the temple is presented in chapter 11.

#### TRADE QUARTER

Most of the citadel's merchants and crafters live and work in the trade quarter. Much of the citadel's commerce takes place here, making it the liveliest area of the city. Well-appointed lodgings are also available for visitors with coin to spare.

# CHAPTER 11 Crowning Moment

Determined to save their world, the characters traveled to Xaryxispace with a fleet of ships at their command. But nothing could have prepared them for the armada of enemy ships and the host of solar dragons guarding the magnificent citadel of the Xaryxian Empire. Though the battle was lost, hope remains!

The characters' arrival at the imperial citadel coincides with the funeral of Emperor Xavan. When Xedalli challenges her brother's claim to the throne and names the characters as her champions, the heroes must do battle with a zodar (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) to decide who will rule as the next emperor.

# ARRIVAL AT THE CITADEL

When the characters approach the imperial citadel, either as prisoners or in their own ship, read:

As your ship draws closer to the citadel, you can make out thousands of people in the streets. The crowds surround the temple at the citadel's peak. By comparison, the two docking platforms at the tail end of the citadel seem quiet.

Characters who have been taken prisoner by the astral elves are stripped of all visible weapons, but they are allowed to keep their armor and other gear. (The same is true for any nonplayer characters who are with them.) A character can conceal a light weapon on their person by succeeding on a DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

Prisoners are delivered to the imperial docks, where they are met by six lawful neutral astral elf warriors and a lawful neutral astral elf honor guard named Corelleth (see Boo's Astral Menagerie for their stat blocks), all of whom are loyal to Princess Xedalli:

Stepping onto a landing, you are met by seven armored figures, their faces hidden behind filigreed visors. Their leader takes a step forward and says, "I am Commander Corelleth. My orders are to deliver you to the Temple of Light to face the emperor's justice." The commander then orders your captors to return your weapons to you. "Princess Xedalli sends her regards."

Weapons confiscated from the characters and their allies are promptly returned to them, after which Corelleth's squad leads the group through the streets of the citadel to the Temple of Light. If the characters flee from their escort, Corelleth's squad doesn't pursue, per Xedalli's instructions.

On the way to the temple, Corelleth gives honest answers to any questions the characters might have. The commander imparts the following information:

- · Following the death of Emperor Xavan, Prince Xeleth has declared that his coronation will take place after the emperor's funeral.
- · Princess Xedalli is being forced to attend her brother's coronation, even though it is the wish of many to see Xedalli and Xeleth coronated jointly, in accordance with their father's wishes.
- · If he becomes emperor, Xeleth will have the characters executed without a trial.

#### INFILTRATING THE CITADEL

If the characters arrive at the citadel in their own ship, they can tell from a distance that the imperial docks are guarded, but the common docks are not.

#### LANDING AT THE COMMON DOCKS

If they land at the common docks, the characters can disembark and enter the city without being seen by guards.

#### LANDING AT THE IMPERIAL DOCKS

If the characters land at the imperial docks or try to enter the citadel by any other method (such as rappelling down on ropes over the middle of the city), they are immediately confronted by Commander Corelleth's squad (see above), which tries to capture them and escort them to the Temple of Light.

#### EXPLORING THE CITY

Characters who avoid or escape the attention of their escorts can move about the citadel as they see fit. Most of the city's inhabitants are too preoccupied with the emperor's funeral and Prince Xeleth's imminent coronation to take notice of the party. Any locals the characters talk to quickly turn the conversation to this topic, encouraging the party to get to the temple quickly before all the best vantage points are taken. The funeral for Emperor Xavan is a lengthy ceremony, which provides the characters with an opportunity to take a short rest before the final showdown in the Temple of Light.

# TEMPLE OF LIGHT

The interior of the Temple of Light is large enough to accommodate dozens of people, while hundreds more gather outside.

#### ENTERING THE TEMPLE

As the characters enter the temple, read:

Pushing your way into the temple through the crowd of onlookers, you see an elf priest presiding over the figure of the late emperor, whose body floats in an azure pool with a brilliant beam of light penetrating it from above. Flanking the priest are Prince Xeleth and Princess Xedalli. The prince is arrayed in regal splendor, his expression one of exultation, while Xedalli stands stiffly, regarding her brother with a look of utter loathing.

Silence fills the temple as the priest raises his arms and the emperor's body, shrouded in light, rises into the beam and disappears.

"The emperor has ascended!" the priest announces. "His spirit is one with the light of Xaryxis. As his firstborn heirs, Prince Xeleth and Princess Xedalli are both, in line to rule, but Princess Xedalli stands accused of treason. Are there any who would defend her claim?"

Prince Xeleth is a chaotic evil astral elf aristocrat with a ring of shooting stars. Princess Xedalli is a chaotic neutral astral elf aristocrat. If Xedalli died previously, the figure standing here is a clone (created using a clone spell). Also present is Andavier, a lawful neutral astral elf star priest, who is overseeing Emperor Xavan's ascension. Watching from the perimeter of the room are twelve astral elf honor guards of various alignments. See Boo's Astral Menagerie for the astral elves' stat blocks.

If the characters don't speak up, Xedalli tries to mount her own defense, accusing her brother of trying to get rid of her and then fabricating the story of her sedition. It is obvious her words do not move the crowd, however. When Xeleth then tells of finding her engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow him, the crowd boos Xedalli and calls for Xeleth to be crowned emperor. Xedalli, in desperation, demands a chance to prove her innocence in a trial by combat-a request that Xeleth mocks:

"Only someone who bears one of the starlight rings can challenge for the right to rule," says the prince. "Where is your ring, dear sister?"

If she has entrusted her ring of shooting stars to the characters, Xedalli points in their direction, causing all eyes in the temple to fall upon them.

If the characters don't have the ring or refuse to present it. Xedalli loses her claim to the throne. Xeleth laughs, after which Andavier declares, "Xeleth is the rightful heir!" Skip ahead to the "All Hail Emperor Xeleth!" section.

#### DEFENDING XEDALLI

If the characters show that they have Xedalli's ring, they are entitled to defend the princess's claim to the throne. Prince Xeleth is irritated and tries to refute their arguments. You can run this scenario as a tense series of verbal thrusts and parries. with Xedalli prompting the characters as needed to recount the various episodes of their mission and their grievances against the Xaryxian Empire, while Xeleth attempts to twist every point against them. Resolve this debate by having one of the characters-whichever one is leading the argument in favor of Xedalli's claim to the throne-make a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If another skill seems more appropriate, use that skill instead. If the character's argument is genuinely persuasive or if other characters contribute to the argument, the check is made with advantage. If the check succeeds, the crowd is swayed in Xedalli's favor. If the check fails, the crowd is not swayed, which pleases Xeleth.

If the characters fail to convince the crowd of Xedalli's innocence, Xedalli resorts to challenging her brother to a trial by combat. If the characters turn the crowd's opinion against the prince, it is instead Xeleth who, seeing his status in danger, challenges Xedalli to combat. In either case, proceed to the "Trial by Combat" section.

If the characters attack Xeleth or otherwise try to rescue Xedalli by force, they find themselves up against overwhelming odds. Xeleth uses Starlight Step and fly to evade their attacks, while the imperial guards do their best to subdue and apprehend the characters. If the characters are captured, Xeleth promises to have them executed as soon as the coronation is over. In the unlikely event that the party defeats Xeleth or drives him off, skip ahead to the "All Hail Emperor Xedalli!" section.

#### ASTRAL FONT

The Astral Font is a 40-foot-diameter, 2-foot-deep pool of glowing, pale liquid fed by a 10-foot-diameter beam of harmless blue light, which streams down from an aperture in the ceiling 175 feet above. The Astral Font has the following magical properties:

Star Beam. A creature that starts its turn in the beam of light is magically teleported to the radiant core of Xaryxis, along with anything it is wearing

or carrying. (The zodar is immune to this effect.) A creature that enters the star or starts its turn there takes 132 (24d10) radiant damage.

- Starlight Spellcasting. Water removed from the Astral Font glows faintly for 24 hours, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius. A spellcaster who quaffs an ounce or more of the glowing water must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 24 (7d6) psychic damage. On a successful save, the creature gains the ability to cast one spell of their choice from the cleric spell list or the wizard spell list. The chosen spell, which must be of 7th level or lower, uses the caster's spellcasting ability and requires no material components. Once the spell is cast, it fades from memory. A creature can gain only one such spell at a time and can't benefit from drinking the pool's water more than once every 24 hours.
# TRIAL BY COMBAT

Xedalli asks the characters to serve as her champions. If the characters accept, read:

Xeleth sneers. "Very well, sister, since you won't face me yourself, I, too, name a champion. Bring forth the zodar!"

The crowd gives out a collective gasp as the guards part ranks to make way for a creature clad head to toe in a suit of obsidian armor. As it floats toward you, you realize the armor is the creature.

The priest turns to face you. "The zodar has served the imperial family since the dawn of the empire. Its knowledge is vast, and its will is absolute. To the death!"

The characters must fight the zodar (see Boo's Astral Menagerie) on their own. See "Running the Zodar" below for more information about this creature.

The characters win the trial by combat if they reduce the zodar to 0 hit points. The zodar wins the battle if all the characters are at 0 hit points at the start of the zodar's turn or if the characters who are still standing concede defeat. The characters forfeit the match if any of them leaves the temple.

Xeleth, Xedalli, and Andavier move to the sidelines for their own safety, protected by royal guards. The audience also moves as far back as they can while preserving their front-row views of the battle.

#### XEDALL'S FAVOR

If the characters swayed the crowd in favor of Princess Xedalli, the princess leads the crowd in a chant before the battle begins. This uplifting tribute grants 20 temporary hit points to each of her champions.

#### RUNNING THE ZODAR

The zodar tries to knock characters unconscious instead of killing them. A character reduced to 0 hit points by the zodar is stable at 0 hit points. (The zodar saves its wish spell for the next chapter.)

If the zodar is reduced to 0 hit points. it slumps in place, apparently inert.

#### AFTERMATH

This chapter's cliffhanger ending depends on who wins the trial by combat.

#### ALL HAIL EMPEROR XELETH!

If the characters are defeated by the zodar (as described earlier in the chapter) or fail to come to Xedalli's defense, read:

The crowd chants, "All hail Emperor Xeleth!"

Xeleth glowers at you. "Pathetic fools. Hurling yourselves into the void without the slightest inkling of who or what is out here. If you knew anything about the true nature of Wildspace, anything at all, you would have hidden from it in terror. Pity I can't destroy your world more than once."

#### Here ends chapter 11.

#### ALL HAIL EMPEROR XEDALLI! If the characters are triumphant, read:

The priest's voice rings throughout the temple. "The zodar is defeated! All hail Emperor Xedalli!"

Xeleth lets out a strangled cry as his sister steps toward you, a wide smile on her face. "My ring, if you please."

If the characters return Xedalli's ring of shooting stars, she slides it onto her finger, clenches her fist, and gazes at the ring lovingly. If the characters refuse to return her ring or claim not to have it, she frowns and says, "No matter."

Whether or not Xedalli gets her ring back, she knows the characters' mission poses a threat to Xaryxispace (as explained in the next chapter) and concludes that the characters have outlived their usefulness. Read:

"As emperor, I must reward my champions for this triumph." Abruptly, Xedalli's smile turns into a sneer. "Guards, seize them!"

Here ends chapter 11.

# CHAPTER 12 Light of Xaryxis.

The Xaryxian Empire bombarded the characters' world with astral seeds, which sprouted into crystal vines that began harvesting the planet's energy. Determined to save their world, the characters fought their way to the imperial citadel orbiting Xaryxis, where the next emperor of the Xaryxian Empire was declared!

Regardless of which sibling-Xeleth or Xedalliascends to the Xaryxian throne, the new emperor orders the execution of the characters. Before that can happen, the zodar intervenes on the party's behalf, using its wish spell to restore the characters to full health.

# DYING WISH

If the zodar was reduced to 0 hit points in the previous chapter's trial by combat, it regains 1 hit point now. At the same time, any unconscious characters regain 1 hit point and wake up. If the characters did not engage in the trial by combat, the zodar floats into view immediately after either Xeleth or Xedalli is hailed as the new emperor.

Unknown to Xeleth or Xedalli, the zodar was tasked by a previous emperor to help bring about the empire's destruction if ever someone of corrupt heart ascended to the throne. The zodar believes that time has finally come. Read the following:

A resounding, supernal voice issues from the zodar, astonishing everyone. "TAKE THE RING OF STARS INTO THE HEART OF THE STAR WHERE IT WAS FORGED, AND YOUR WORLD WILL BE SAVED." At this pronouncement, golden light spills from the zodar's eyes and washes over you. The zodar then crumbles into dust.

As a result of the zodar's wish, the characters regain all their hit points. Each character also receives the benefit of a greater restoration spell. Seeing the characters invigorated in this way causes all the astral elves in the Temple of Light, including Xeleth and Xedalli, to wonder if the gods have forsaken them. Why else, as they see it, would the zodar, which has defended the royal family for eons, bestow such a gift on the empire's enemies?

The zodar's pronouncement tells the characters what they must do to save their world: hurl Xeleth's

or Xedalli's ring of shooting stars into the heart of Xaryxis. Doing so not only destroys the star and everything else in Xaryxispace but also kills off the crystal vines threatening the characters' world.

Depending on how the previous chapter played out, the characters might have Xedalli's ring in their possession. If not, they will need to acquire that ring or obtain its twin, which is worn by Xeleth.

#### OBTAINING A RING

Andavier knows what will happen if the characters do as the zodar commands and makes these consequences known to everyone within earshot:

"Hurling a royal ring into the heart of Xaryxis will destroy not only the star but everything in this system!"

Andavier orders the audience to evacuate the Temple of Light. The priest leads the exodus, leaving the characters and their allies alone with Xeleth, Xedalli, and the siblings' royal guards.

Xeleth and Xedalli are astral elf aristocrats, and at least Xeleth has his ring of shooting stars. Twelve astral elf honor guards (see Boo's Astral Menagerie for their stat blocks) stand ready to defend whichever sibling was named emperor in the previous chapter.

Whichever sibling was declared emperor in the previous chapter orders the guards to attack the characters, using the distraction to try to summon a solar dragon before joining the fray. Meanwhile, the other sibling casts fly and tries to flee the temple.

# LIFE OR DEATH

When the characters have at least one ring of shooting stars in their custody, they must decide whether to destroy Xaryxis (to save their world and others like it) or to spare it (thus sealing their world's doom). If the characters seek the counsel of allies, use the following information to guide those conversations:

Commodore Krux. The giff is adamant that Xaryxis be destroyed. He reminds the characters of the many worlds the Xaryxian Empire has wiped out of existence.

Flinch. The hadozee recommends mercy for the astral elves. Flinch explains that his concern is not for the people of Xaryxispace but for the

characters, because he has seen how the desire for revenge can bring great souls low-a remark that shames Krux into silence.

- Grimzod Gargenhale. Grimzod heartily endorses the destruction of Xaryxis, insisting that the astral elves have that and worse coming to them.
- Starbough. The destruction of Xaryxis would end the lives of all the creatures in Xaryxispace-an incalculable loss, in Starbough's estimation.
- Topolah. If blowing up the star is what it takes to save the characters' world, then Topolah is all for it. She also observes that the opportunity to witness the death of a star is a once-in-a-lifetime event.
- Warwyck Blastimoff. Warwyck reminds the characters that good soldiers have fought and died to give the characters this chance at saving their world. He hopes they'll follow through.

#### FATE OF THE IMPERIAL CITADEL

Magister Theraxana and the mages of the Great Orrery have the means to move the imperial citadel out of Xaryxispace and into the Astral Sea, but not the authority. Magister Theraxana, a stickler for protocol, declares that the imperial citadel won't leave Xaryxispace "without a command from the emperor." Neither Xeleth nor Xedalli will give this order, as it would mean accepting defeat.

#### NO COMING BACK

To destroy Xaryxis, someone bearing Xeleth's or Xedalli's ring of shooting stars must travel into the heart of the star, either by ship (a three-day voyage) or via the Astral Font's light beam (see chapter 11). It is, everyone realizes, a journey from which there is no coming back.

If no characters volunteer for this mission, Grimzod Gargenhale does so. If the characters allow Grimzod to sacrifice himself, he says, "I hope you all appreciate the irony of a vampirate flying into the sun." He then entrusts his crawling claw to Topolah, saying, "Let it never be said that Grimzod Gargenhale failed to give a lovely lady a hand."

Commodore Krux is reluctant to entrust the ring of shooting stars to the vampirate. A character must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Krux to let Gargenhale have the ring and make this doomsday trip. Once he has the ring, Gargenhale enters the Astral Font's light beam. Moments later, he disappears and is gone forever.

If a character enters the heart of Xaryxis, describe their final moments as follows:

Unfettered radiance tears through your flesh as you are pulled into the star's blinding core.

#### DEATH OF A STAR When Xaryxis is destroyed, read:

The star flares, becoming a thousand times brighter. Moments later, it is gone. Shock waves of multicolored energy expand outward from the collapsed star, threatening all in their path.

The shock waves destroy everything in Xaryxispace but don't extend into the Astral Sea. The characters and their NPC allies have enough time to board a ship and use its spelljamming helm to reach the Astral Sea before the shock waves can catch up with them.

# CONCLUSION

The characters' return voyage can be as eventful or uneventful as you like. As for the characters' world, its fate is inexorably bound with the fate of Xaryxis.

## XARYXIS IS SPARED

If Xaryxis was not destroyed, the characters return home to find their world on the brink of annihilation. As the planet begins to fracture, the characters might decide to help evacuate and resettle survivors on the other worlds of their system.

# XARYXIS IS DESTROYED

If Xaryxis was destroyed, the characters return home to find that the crystal vines that were choking their world have shattered and collapsed. Among the world's inhabitants, shock at the sudden reprieve has given way to relief and jubilation.

The destruction of Xaryxis forces what's left of the Xaryxian Empire to take refuge in the Astral Sea, where the astral elves still have numerous ships and strongholds. Xeleth and Xedalli had one clone apiece, making it likely that at least one sibling will survive the adventure with a hunger for revenge.

# FURTHER ADVENTURES

This section provides a couple suggestions for how you can continue this campaign:

- Beyond the Eye of Doom. Is the Eye of Doom in Doomspace a gateway to a new Wildspace system? One or more NPCs encourage the characters to mount an expedition to discover what lies on the other side of the vortex.
- Back to Bral. If the characters return to the Rock of Bral, tales of their heroism travel quickly to the palace of Starhaven, where the characters are invited to meet Prince Andru. Perhaps the Bralian monarch has a quest for them!

The end ... ?

# SAVIORS OF THE MULTIVERSE!

When a cosmic enemy threatens to destroy their world, brave heroes must do everything in their power to save it. This quest will take them across the teeming oceans of Wildspace to the silvery void of the Astral Sea and beyond. Along the way, they'll make friends, encounter terrifying foes, and face one cliffhanger after another. Can they save their world before time runs out?

#### SUFFOCATING

You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

If you run out of breath or you're choking, you can survive for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of your next turn, you drop to 0 hit points and are dying, and you can't regain hit points or be stabilized until you can breathe again.

#### WEICHTLESSNESS

In any location where gravity is not present, the following rules apply:

Impeded Melee. When making a melee attack with a weapon, a creature that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed (either naturally or provided by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon deals piercing damage.

Movement. A creature can use an action to push off something heavier than itself and move up to its walking, flying, or swimming speed in a straight line. The creature continues along this course, moving in a straight line at its speed on each of its turns until something stops it or changes its trajectory.

#### ASTRAL ENCOUNTERS

You can generate a random encounter in the Astral Plane by rolling on either the Wildspace Encounters table or the Astral Sea Encounters table, as appropriate, or by choosing an encounter you like. If the encounter is with a spelljamming ship, you can roll on the Ship Encounters table to determine the ship and its crew, or you can create a ship encounter of your own (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide for ship descriptions). Creatures marked with an asterisk (*) appear in Boo's Astral Menagerie; the rest are described in the Monster Manual. Any creature marked with a dagger (†) can serve as a spelljammer because it is a spellcaster.

If a Humanoid has no specified race, it can be of any race you choose.

#### INITIAL ATTITUDE

To randomly determine the initial attitude of the creatures encountered, make the attitude roll called for in an encounter table entry, then refer to the appropriate line of the Initial Attitude table

INITIAL ATTITUDE Attitude Roll Total Initial Attitude 4 or lower Hostile 5-8 Indifferent 9 or higher

#### SHIP-TO-SHIP STARTING DISTANCE

At the start of an engagement, decide how far a ship is from its enemies. Three possibilities are provided in the table below. The shorter the distance, the less time crews have to load weapons and make other preparations.

#### Distance Notes 250 feet Long range for ballistae, mango nels, shortbows, longbows, light crossbows, and heavy crossbows 500 feet Long range for longbows and mangonels; too far for ballistae and crossbows ,000 feet Beyond the range of most ranged weapons

#### CRASHING

When a spelljamming ship crashes into a creature or an object that could reasonably damage it, both the ship and the creature or object it struck take oludgeoning damage based on the size of the struck object, as shown in the table below.

| Size of Creature or Object Struck | Bludgeoning Damage |
| --- | --- |
| Large | 4d10 |
| Huge | 8d10 |
| Gargantuan | 16d10 |

If the ship runs into something that doesn't have hit points (such as a planet or a moon), apply the damage only to the ship. The ship stops after crashing into a Gargantuan or immovable creature or object; otherwise, the ship can continue moving if it has any movement left, and whatever it struck moves to the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the ship's path.

#### SHIPBOARD TASKS

During the uneventful part of a voyage, the captain of a spelljamming ship can put crew members to work in several ways. If a character is looking for a job to do, or if a captain wants to keep a character busy, rol on the Shipboard Tasks table to determine what needs to be done. The time it takes to complete a task is at least 1 hour, and certain tasks might take longer at your discretion.

#### SHIPBOARD TASKS

- d12 Task
- 1 Scrape barnacles off the hull.
- 2 Scrub pots and dishes in the galley
- 3 Chop vegetables in the galley.
- 4 Swab the deck or sweep the cargo hold.
- Update the ship's navigational charts, which requires cartographer's tools.
- Repair the captain's favorite pair of boots, which requires cobbler's tools. (A mending spell also does the trick.)
- 7 Repair superficial damage to the ship, which requires carpenter's tools or woodcarver's tools. (A mending spell also does the trick
- 8 Compose a new chantey, which requires a musical instrument.
- 9 Entertain the crew with tall tales of gossip.
- 10 Fix the captain's broken spyglass which requires jeweler's tools or tinker's tools. (A mending spell also does the trick.)
- Teach the captain the basics of a language they don't already know
- Prepare a tasty dinner for the cap tain's table, which requires cook's utensils.

#### SHIP QUIRKS

 Roll on the Ship Quirks table if you want to add a bit of "personality" to a ship.

SHIP CARGO

#### SHIP QUIRKS

- d10 Quirk
- A chatty but harmless spirit haunts the cargo hold.
- The excessive creaking of the hul echoes throughout the ship.
- Any creature that removes itsel from the ship's spelljamming helm receives a startling but harmless magical shock.
- The ship's companionways are smaller than those found in most other similar vessels.
- The ship makes a groaning sound in what seems like defiance whenever it comes to a stop.
- The floor of the main deck is adorned with a stylized rendering of a mysterious star chart that pulsates occasionally with scintillating colors.
