# PRAISE FOR MONSTER MANUAL EXPANDED

"A fantastic resource for DMs that want to keep players on their toes or want stronger or weaker variants of certain monsters."

- Comicbook.com

"The attention to detail, and the scale of this product is absolutely worth vour money."

- Celeste Conowitch

"Monster Manual Expanded does a fantastic job of lovingly recreating monsters that were sadly missing from 5e."

- Nerd Immersion

"The variants are more than additional stats for DMs to memorize; they are reference materials that enhance the known lore of beloved creatures, giving more clues to their ecological life histories and/or societal structures."

- Bob World Builder

"It gives you a wealth of options at various levels which just creates more replavability. Very well done! Well worth your money!"

- Allthingslich

"The creativity and attention to detail that went into this already makes it must have companion to your Monster Manual."

- D&D Character Lab

"I'm just going to call this Monster Manual II. This is by far the BEST product I have ever purchased on DMs Guild!"

- Paul S. M

"The creativity and attention to detail that went into this already makes it must have companion to your MM ... This is one of those ideas that creators would slap their forehead and wonder why they didn't think of it first. While some products have offered variations on known monsters before, this perfects that model with expansive worldbuilding while taking very logical steps both up and down in power from the standard blocks."

- Garin I.

"The reviews about this product are bang on. This is the MM on steroids!"

- Brian S.

"Superb resource for challenging highlevel PCs with a variety of subtly different versions of familiar adversaries. Great idea, completed by great design and utility. Highly recommended. Makes DM-ing for a gonzo group of murderhomebrewed murder hobos more interesting, surprising and convenient."

- Aran M.

"Outstanding! Particularly if you have a campaign of high-level players who have memorized the Monster Manual, get this book!"

- Mike M.

"The writing, layout and art are all topnotch. This a hefty tome offering hundreds of monsters and NPCs that really fill important gaps with the official Monster Manual. "

- Christopher B.

"What a spectacular thing to behold! This amazing product contains some unique monsters never seen before in other supplements with amazing mechanics that will surely surprise your players!"

- Libedrator E.

"An incredible product and a must for any Dungeon Master or creator of adventures."

- 5E S. G.

"This product is a wonderful complement to the moster manual. I found the expanded monster variants to be very helpful when designing interesting and challenging encounters. "

- Stephen G.

I was hesitant to buy this because of the price, but i'm very happy I did, seeing the table of contents was what sold it... Can't stress this enough, if you're on the fence, you should probably just buy it :).

- Josh W.

"Fantastic product! A great reference to keep my vetran[sic] players on thier[sic] toes. Also great for inspiring me when writtingvadventures[sic]."

- Dustin T.

"A fantastic Monster List adds loads to the Monster Manual's creatures, highly recommeneded[sic]."

# ABOUT THIS BOOK

The Monster Manual is a fantastic body of work. However, as a detail and tactical-oriented DM, I felt that the content was lacking in a variety of creature types that I could use to represent my miniatures something that the 3rd/4th editions had in abundance. This gap inspired me to create an expansion that would address my needs. I hope this book addresses your needs, as well. Enjoy unleashing new horrors to surprise your plavers and keep them on their toes!

# ABOUT THE COVER

I wanted to pay homage to the current Monster Manual, which shows one of my favorite monsters of all time - the beholder. I remember when I first beheld the beholder was when I bought a copy of the Companion Set. I was in awe of its appearance and its powers. I remember I couldn't wait to unleash it on my players. So now that I have created my version of the Ultimate Tyrant, I wanted to show it on this book's cover.

# CHAPTER I. THE BESTIARY

ithin the next 300+ pages are four hundred plus creatures, stat blocks, and lore that can be used for any D&D Campaign. Among the creatures included are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd edition classics as well as original variants. Among the old favorites returning are the elder orb, gorgimera, lamia noble,

margoyle, neo-otyugh, and ultimate tyrant. Some come from the more obscure sources, and are probably only familiar to a few: the agarat, baernoloth, gulguthydra, uchuulun, and the urophion.

The Bestiary serves as an expansion to the Monster Manual. Almost all creatures from the Monster Manual are represented, with additional lore provided for nearly every new variant. These creatures are not just high level rehashes of their original bases. As much as possible, each has been thoughtfully designed to provide a different combat experience, enabling the Dungeon Master to startle and catch player characters off guard. Good examples of these are the demon and devil variants that bring back the feel of the classics: vrocks that can perform the dance of ruin, balor lords that can cast spells and dive down like a meteor, and pit fiends with eye beams that can disintegrate their foes.

The Bestiary's largest impact, however, will be on the various humanoids and giants, whose ranks swell with various archetypes. Berserkers, bruisers, champions, chieftains, shamans, skirmishers, marauders, priests, witch doctors, and many more have been created to provide the Dungeon Master flexibility

and variety of options to populate their lairs. No longer will the Dungeon Master keep using the same type of giant or humanoid in every room the plavers enter.

 In a goblins' lair, for example, you can now have goblin skirmishers and cutthroats mixed in with the regular goblins as guards in the common areas. In worship rooms, you can place shamans and witch doctors. In arcane-type chambers, you can have alchemists and blackblades. In the throne room, you can have the chieftain and goblin bodyguards, as well as a goblin boss serving as its council.

Another thing the Bestiary addresses is creating high CR variants of typically low CR creatures. This provides the low CR creatures with boss versions, such as the ankheg brood queen, battle horror, harpy witch, werewolf pack lord, and the various elder hags.

Finally, the Bestiary also provides the Dungeon Master a handful of epic encounters that should challenge the mightiest of player characters. These include the aboleth overseer, ancient behir, cloaker lord, death knight lord, greater banshee, greater medusa, lamia queen, oni lord, rakshasa maharaja, Shaytan angels, ultimate tyrant, and the vampire lord.

As in the Monster Manual, there will be two appendices following the Bestiary. The first one will be assorted creatures that will feature various vermin and beasts, including the returning greenvise, hatori, and sword spider. The second one will be various nonplayer characters, which shall feature both low and high-level archetypes.

# AARAKOCRAS

# AARAKOCRA BRAVE

Aarakocra braves are masters of aerial combat and serve as their tribe's primary warriors. They engage in hit and run tactics, taking full advantage of their flyby feature.

# AARAKOCRA SCOUT

Aarakocra scouts serve their tribes as skilled hunters and early-warning sentries. They often engage in reconnaissance missions, searching for any possible threats to their roosts. On rare occassions they may be hired as scouts, as long as they are convinced that the nature of the work will be not be in detriment to the innocent.

# ABOLETHS

# ABOLETH OVERSEER

One of the most powerful and exceedingly insidious creatures that can be encountered in the Realms, the aboleth overseer is an ancient being that has enslaved city after city, leaving despair in its wake.

Insidious Enslaver. When an aboleth overseer finds a new city near a large body of water (coast, lake, etc.), it begins its onslaught by enslaving nearby locals and criminal elements such as pirates to gather information, all the while being careful not to show its true appearance. It then works its way up, using the enslaved locals to bring strategic targets (such as officials, wealthy merchants, etc.) to within the aboleth overseer's enslave range.

Master Manipulator. Once it has established a network of controlled individuals in strategic positions, it strengthens its stranglehold through bribery, coercion, murder, and enslavement. Within a matter of a few years, the aboleth overseer may have total control of the entire city. When it has finally acquired all the knowledge and treasure it can gain, or tires of the city, it manipulates its victims to sow distrust and cause mayhem, resulting in civil unrest and mass killings. It is so devious in its methods that it may leave a city devastated without anyone knowing that it existed.

# ABOLETH SLIME LORD

The slime lord is a species commonly found within the underwater depths of Demogorgon's palace known as the Abysm, and the Far Realm. However, they can also be very rarely encountered in deep, fetid marshy waters and the foulest Underdark lakes.

Acidic Mucus. The slime lord is a disgusting version of an aboleth, if such a thing is even possible. The foul mucus the aboleth slime lord secretes is so caustic and sticky that it has developed the ability to cast it at targets in order to ensnare and weaken them.

Skum Beast. These are the poor animals and beasts that have been transformed by the aboleth's disease and now serve as guardians and scouts.

Skum Hulk. On very rare occasions, the aboleth might be able to capture and enslave an ogre or even a young giant, transforming it into one of its mutated slaves, making it one of its personal bodyguards.

# ANGELS, SHAYTAN

While most fallen angels have usually gone astray due to Asmodeus' corruption, some have succumbed to the temptations of Graz'zt, The Dark Prince of Pleasure, or Malcanthet, the Succubus Queen. These angels are known as Shaytan or shayatin. Once beautiful and majestic, they have turned into dark and hateful opposites of their former selves.

The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

Change Shape. The shaytan magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form . It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the shaytan's choice). In a new form, the shaytan retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

Shadow Fiends. No longer celestials, these angels have lost some of their powers, including fast flight speed, magic resistance, and the ability to project radiant energy. These changes resulted in driving most of them insane. Now as fiends, they draw their power from the Shadowfell and the Abyss. Their bodies are always cloaked with oozing shadows and their eyes limned with abyssal fire.

Demonic Servants. Once messengers and executors of the will of their gods, they now serve Demon Princes as assassins and generals, often leading shadow demons in their missions. Twisted and vengeful, they scheme and bide their time until an opportunity presents itself where they can wreak havoc and deal the most damage against their former gods who have forsaken them, often striking at those who worship them.

# ANIMATED OBJECTS

# ANIMATED STATUES

Animated statues look very much like large 8-to12-feet tall statues that you can find in temples, gardens, crypts, and palace halls.

Faux Golems. Often mistaken for golems, animated statues are less potent but inexpensive substitutes, often crafted to serve as intimidating deterrents to burglars and intruders. Sometimes, the wealthy families hire unscrupulous wizards and artificers to create golems for them to serve as guardians, and they unknowingly end up paying for animated statues, unable to tell the difference.

# ANKHEG

# BROOD QUEEN

An ankheg brood queen is very rarely seen, as it spends most of its

time deep underground where it is well protected by its brood. Egg layer. The brood queen is about twice the size of a normal adult ankheg and has a huge bloated abdomen filled with egg sacs. When threatened, it will lay eggs in which broodlings will hatch

from and they will immediately protect their queen. Fiercely Territorial. The brood queen is cunning and very paranoid. Its territory stretches for miles and it will actively hunt down any other potential brood queen threat, even if it is its progeny.

Directors. If ankheg attacks appear to be coordinated and organized, chances are a brood queen is behind them. Adventurers may be hired for the dangerous task of finding its lair and killing it.

# BANSHEE, GREATER

A greater banshee appears to be like any other banshee at first, except for the power it radiates. It may be too late however before adventurers can even tell the difference.

Noble Magic-users. Greater banshees were once powerful magic practioners in life and often held important responsibilites or positions, such as a queen, royal advisor, or guild wizard. But due to greed, jealousy, and narcissism, they had schemed and acted out evil and malicious deeds.

Vengeful and Malevolent Spirits. Caught and executed for their crimes, they would rise from the dead after many years, or even centuries, later and haunt their sites, slaying anything living. They would actively hunt for the descendants of those who they believe have wronged them.

# Agatha

"The twisted visage of a long-dead elven maiden, her skin withered and stretched along her hollow face and her eyes bereft of color or any spark of life."

- R. A. Salvatore, The Halfling's Gem

Agatha was a powerful elven wizard, often described by those few who seen her and returned alive as a graceful elven figure wearing a rich gown and flowing white hair. However, her skin has shriveled and her eyes are but empty sockets.

Agatha lives in the Dessarin river region, in a grove that can be found at the end of a trail in the northwest part of the Conyberry area in Neverwinter Winter Wood and southwest of Longsaddle.

Unlike most banshees, Agatha does not appear to be inherently evil. She avoids contact whenever possible, and has taken up the task as the protector of the town of Conyberry, sometimes providing the townsfolk with food during the harsh winters and defending againt humanoid raiders.

It is not impossible to seek her out for her knowledge or trading for magical items, but she has gone very wary and more isolated ever since a magical item of hers, a mask that enabled the wearer to appear as a difference race, was stolen by the dark elf Drizzt and his companions. Still, Agatha is known to be a collector of spellbooks and artifacts, and may not resist a tempting offer from resourceful adventurers.

On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

# BEHOLDERS

This section covers 4 species of beholderkin: the elder orb, the eye of flame, the eye of frost, and the ultimate tyrant.

# ELDER ORB

Compared to its normal kin, the Elder Orb is a more advanced and dangerous beholder with the innate ability to cast arcane spells. Save for the Ultimate Tyrant, the Elder Orb is probably the most intelligent of its kind, but also the most cunning, diabolical, and cruel as well.

Master Racists. Elder Orbs sometimes serve as advisors to Ultimate Tyrants, but most are leaders of various beholder factions. They think of themselves as the pinnacle of beholderkind, as well as pushing beholders as the supreme race and master of all other beings. They have bribed, threatened, and killed their way to place themselves in strategically high, if not the highest, positions of every faction they have managed to reach, often without revealing their true nature. It is rumored that the current Xanathar is an Elder Orb.

# EYE OF FLAME

The Eye of Flame is a relatively weaker species compared to the common beholder but it is still as devious and ruthless. It closely resembles a normal beholder, save for the crimson tone of its chitinous bony plates. If not lording over less intelligent races, they serve as guardians under the employ of more powerful beholders, red dragons, fire giants, and efreet. Their masters highly value the eye of flame's vulnerability to fire cone, as this makes their fire-based abilities even more dangerous.

# EYE OF FROST

The Eye of Frost is a solitary type of beholderkin that has mostly shunned the rest of its kind. It has ivory white chitinous skin that blends well with its preferred snowy surroundings. It is almost always only found in arctic locales or in cavern complexes deep beneath frozen glaciers. It prefers to have servants and slaves though, thus it would go out of its way to conquer a local humanoid or monstrous tribe, slaying its leaders before finally taking over as its master. It wouldn't be surprising to find its lair to be occupied by winter wolves, yeti, and arctic goblins that do its bidding.

As with the Eye of Flame, the Eye of Frost is valued by more powerful cold-type creatures such as white dragons and frost giants for its ability to project cold vulnerability. Thus, they are often bribed and paid handsomely for their services as lair guardians.

# BLIGHT

# ANCIENT BLIGHT

Ancient blights were once treants that have been corrupted by the blood of Gulthias. It resembles a normal dead tree from afar, until its roots come alive and become grasping, clawing tendrils when a victim comes too close. Once it has captured its prey, the ancient blight clubs it to death with its powerful limbs. It then lets the victim's blood drain into the ground where its roots wait to absorb it.

# TREE BLIGHT

Tree blights are corrupted awakened trees. They no longer swing their limbs but instead have branches that end in claws which they use to tear their victims to shreds. The insidious tree blights will mostly set themselves near a seldomly used path or animal trail and lie in wait amongst other snags. It is not uncommon to find them around a hag's lair.

# BUGBEARS

# BRUISER

# CHAMPION OF HRUGGEK

Believed to be blessed by the bugbear deity, the Champion of Hruggek is often the largest and mightiest bugbear of the tribe. Wielding an oversized morningstar, this monstrous bugbear can stagger even the hardiest of opponents if it hits them hard enough.

# FOOTPAD

Cunning and sneaky, the footpads serve as the tribe's scouts and assassins. They can infiltrate enemy camps, strangle targets quietly with their garrotes, and leave without getting noticed.

# MARAUDER

These highly mobile bugbears are killers who aim to break enemy ranks and distract defenders with their attacks. In battle, the raiders move to flank their foes or rush vulnerable targets in order to create openings for their allies.

# PRIEST OF HRUGGEK

The priests often hold the most influence and political power of a tribe. They are primarily concerned with advancing Hruggek's and their tribes' interests, as well as their own.

While they primarily serve as support, priests of Hruggek relish the opportunity to be in the thick of the battle, smiting foes with their empowered weapons as well as bestowing boons to nearby allies.

# GREAT BULETTE

Even more terrible than the bulettes are their very rare elder cousins, the great bulettes.

About the size of a two-story house, the ferocious great bulette can lay waste to a village in a few hours and not leave a single survivor. Adventurers have stumbled into dungeons that have been stripped of its inhabitants, devoured by the massive bulette that only cares to eat, leaving only gaping tunnels and pits in its wake.

In combat, the great bulette prefers to ambush its prey by bursting forth from underground to knock them down. It then uses Deadly Leap if it can hit two or more targets. Afterwards, it will focus on trying to catch a target with its bite so that it can swallow it.

Standing Leap. The bulette's long jump is up to 40 feet and its high jump is up to 20 feet, with or without a running start.

Burst Forth (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). As a bonus action, the bulette breaks through solid ground or wall, showering the area with debris. Each creature within 15 feet of the bulette that is surprised must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw, taking 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and isn't knocked prone on a successful one.

Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). If the bulette takes 29 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The bulette makes three melee attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Hit: 38 (5d12 + 6) percing damage, and if the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the bulette can bite only the grappled creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage.

Deadly Leap. If the bulette jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is with in range, the creature instead falls prone in the bulette's space.

Swallow. The bulette makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the bulette, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the bulette's turns. A bulette can have only up to one Medium or two Small creatures swallowed at a time.

If the bulette takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the bulette must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the bulette. If the bulette dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Due to its size, its tentacles are large and long enough to attack different targets within reach, making it even more dangerous. Worse, it can unleash its tentacles in a blinding flurry, able to attack up to eight targets!

# CHIMERA

Presented in this section are three additional and very rare species of chimera - the ankhimera, gorgimera, and mantimera, as well as the advanced version of the standard chimera - the ancient chimera.

# ANCIENT CHIMERA

When the common chimera has lasted more than twice its average lifespan, it eventually grows into a more powerful and formidable form. It is easily twice the size of the normal chimera, and has developed the ability to unleash a frightening roar.

The ancient chimera is fiercely territorial, and will actively hunt down and drive out any competitors and predators within miles of its lair. When an ancient chimera has finally settled, the area around it soon becomes dismal and desolate - with the various bones of its prey littering the ground.

Although more beast than dragon, the ancient chimera is still fond of hoarding treasure, and may actually be coaxed by a formidable creature (such as an archmage, demon, lich, or giant) to serve as a guardian if paid and fed well.

# ACTIONS

Multiattack. The chimera makes four attacks: one with its lion head's bite, one with its dragon head's bite, one with its horns, and one with its claws. When its fire breath is available, it can use the breath in place of its dragons head's bite.

- Lion's Roar (Costs 2 Actions). The chimera's lion head emits a magical roar. Each creature within 120 feet that can hear its roar must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be and frightened for one minute. If a creature fails its saving throw by 5 or more, the creature is also paralyzed while frightened for the same duration. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Lion's Roar the next 24 hours.

#### ANKHIMERA

The ankhimera is a fairly new type of chimeric creature that was created through the experiments of a mad wizard. Instead of having a lion's head and foreclaws, the ankhimera has an ankheg's. Due to this change, the ankhimera is able to burrow through earth using its ankheg's forelimbs. In combat, it is able to spit acid just like a normal ankheg, in addition to its normal dragon's breath. When hunting, the ankhimera prefers to wait and hide in a burrow to ambush prey.

The gorgimera is more aggressive and ill-tempered than its common cousin, and is quick to charge at any creature that approaches or looks like food to it.

#### MANTIMERA

While not as powerful as the gorgimera, the mantimera is certainly the most hideous species of chimera. Instead of the standard lion parts, the mantimera has the head, forelimbs, and tail of a manticore. Just like a manticore, it can unleash terrible iron-like spikes from its tail during combat.

# CLOAKERS

# CLOAKER LORD

Cloaker Lords are huge shadows that take to the air, having an average wingspan of 30 feet. They are the highly intelligent supreme leaders and rulers of all cloakerkind and sometimes lead their kin in daring raids against Underdark drow, svirfneblin, and illithid communities. However, cloaker lords prefer to stav within the confines of their lairs, sending out cloakers to scout and do their bidding. They are never without at least half a dozen cloakers nearby as bodyguards.

When forced into combat, a cloaker lord first unleashes its spells and uses its phantasm for protection. When it finds a suitable vulnerable target, such as a spellcaster, it targets that for its bite attack and attachment. While attached to its victim, the cloaker lord will fend off attackers with its tail, disrupting moan, and commanded cloakers.

If the target's saving throw fails by 5 or more, it is paralyzed while frightened in this way. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker lord's moan for the next 24 hours.

Disrupting Moan (Recharges 5-6). Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker lord that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker lord with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker lord or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself

by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 17 Strength check.

Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.

Vampiric Drain. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature the cloaker is attached to. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the cloaker regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way rises as a shadow under the cloaker's control.

Moan. Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours.

Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

Shadow Jump. If the cloaker is in dim light or darkness, each creature of the cloaker's choice within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (3d12 + 2) necrotic damage.

The cloaker then magically teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It can bring one creature it's attached to, teleporting that creature to an unoccupied space it can see within 5 feet of its destination. The destination spaces of this teleportation must be in dim light or darkness.

# COCKATRICE

# GREATER COCKATRICE

The abominable greater cockatrice is a far more horrifving version of the common cockatrice. It is about the size of a horse, has more leathery reptilian scales and skin than it has feathers, a long serpentine tail that ends with a vicious stinger, and a foul beak that drips with venom.

Rare Guardians. Thankfully, the greater cockatrice is rarely encountered, as it avoids populous areas, and is said to haunt only deserted ruins and desolate locales. They are often kept as

Petrifying Gaze. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the cockatrice and the two of them can see each other, the cockatrice can force the creature to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the cockatrice isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

guardians or pets by more powerful creatures such as lamias and greater medusae.

Prized Carcass. Apothecarists, artificers, enchanters, and wizards greatly value the body parts of a greater cockatrice as magical ingredients for their concoctions, spells, and magical creations and would hire adventurers to seek and hunt a greater cockatrice. Only a few manage to return to claim their rewards, and seldom do they account for the cost it took.

A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the cockatrice until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the cockatrice in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The cockatrice makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its claws, and one with its stinger.

Beak. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against being magically petrified. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 24 hours.

Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

Stinger. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

# SWARM OF CRAWLING CLAWS

A swarm of crawling claws is a horrid sight to behold. It acts like a normal swarm of insects with a malevolent intelligence that has caught its victims by surprise.

The swarm often attacks only a single creature at a time, using sheer numbers to overwhelm and knock a target prone so it can finish it with its flesh rending fingers.

# DARKMANTLE

# MINDMANTLE

In very rare instances, a darkmantle would happen upon a very weak, wounded, or dying mind flayer that has either been left by its companions or cast out from its community. Unable to defend itself, the once mighty mindflayer becomes prey to the lowly darkmantle. Weeks after the darkmantle has consumed the mindflayer, a mutation curiously occurs. The darkmantle's head slightly increases in size, and its intelligence and awareness improves, slowly viewing its brethren as crude and slow. It transforms into a mindmantle and begins to crave brain matter.

Madness Inducers. At first, the mindmantle behaves like any other darkmantle. It clings to a cavern ceiling and waits for its prey to pass underneath. When it strikes, it attaches itself to its victim's head. As soon as it gets a strong hold, it uses its madness ability to gain control of it and fend off the victim's allies.

Damage Transfer. While attached to a creature, the mindmantle takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down) and that creature takes the other half.

Echolocation. The mindmantle can't use its blindsight while deafened.

False Appearance. While the mindmantle remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a cave formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite.

#### ACTIONS

Crush. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (ld6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the mindmantle attaches to the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the mindmantle has advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target's head, and the target is also blinded and unable to breathe while the mindmantle is attached in this way.

While attached to the target, the mindmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The mindmantle's speed also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus

to its speed, and it moves with the target.

A creature can detach the mindmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the mindmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.

Darkness Aura (3/Day). A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the mindmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the mindmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

Madness. A target the mindmantle is attached to must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage on the roll or be magically charmed by the mindmantle until the mindmantle dies, is incapacitated, or is detached from the target. While the target is charmed in this way, it can telepathically see through the mindmantle's eyes.

The charmed target is under the mindmantle's control and the mindmantle and the target can communicate telepathically. The mindmantle can choose to loosen its grip on the target's head so that the target can breathe.

On each of its turns, the charmed target must move toward a creature of the mindmantle's choosing and make a melee attack against it if it is within reach.

On its subsequent turns, the mindmantle must use its action to maintain control over the target, or the effect ends.

The target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success. the spell ends. Also, whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

# DEATH KNIGHT LORD

# DEATH KNIGHT LORD

Death Knight Lords were once powerful noble paladins and blackguards. Stronger and deadlier, it is fortunate that there are only a few of them existing, and each has a name that brings chills up the spines of hardened adventurers.

Seldom does the death knight lord leave its lair. But when it does, it is a harrowing sight as a death knight lord is never without its entourage of skeleton champions, knights, and banshees. Most have nightmares as steeds but a few command skeleton dragons or even dracoliches. More often than not, if it is travelling, it is leading an army of the undead.

Undead Nature. A death knight lord doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Fear Aura. A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the death knight must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, unless the death knight is incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the death knight by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the Dash action. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the death knight, the creature can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the death knight's Fear Aura for the next 24 hours.

Magic Resistance. The death knight has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Marshal Undead. Unless the death knight is incapacitated, it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead.

Smite (1/Turn). As a bonus action, when the death knight hits a creature with a weapon attack, it can expend a 1st level spell slot to deal 2d8 radiant or necrotic damage to the target. If the death knight expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 1st (maximum 5d8).

Spellcasting. The death knight is a 19th-level spell caster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following paladin spells prepared:

Hellfire Orb (1/Day). The death knight hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 42 (12d6) fire damage and 42 (12d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

# LEGENDARY ACTIONS

Multiattack. The doppelganger makes three melee attacks.

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 +5) bludgeoning damage.

Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Read Thoughts. The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.

Ambusher. In the first round of combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.

Dark Whispers. The doppelganger can use a bonus action on its turn to target one creature within 30 feet of it.

While frightened in this way, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the doppelganger by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the Dash action. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the doppelganger, the creature can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

# DRAGON TURTLES

# YOUNG DRAGON TURTLE

Young dragon turtles are more commonly encountered as they are more prone to attack smaller ships compared to the bigger adults. It is also at this stage that they begin to build their obsession with gold and treasure which they discover can be easily taken from busy shipping lanes.

Fortunately for the sailors, young dragon turtles rarely live to adult age, as they are often mortally wounded by savagely territorial and greedy dragon turtles.

"Something I overheard from a harbormaster at Port Nyanzaru ... a pirate ship was spotted taking refuge in a secret cove somewhere north of the Mistcliffs in the bay of Chult. Mercenaries and adventurers were conscripted to capture them the following day. But after they tracked them down, they were shocked at what they discovered ... hundreds of sea gulls, crabs, and other scavengers feasting on the blood, torn limbs, and gutted remains lying on the beach. And not a single living pirate in sight. You know what was interesting? They discovered dozens of giant cracked shells half buried in the beach not too far from where the pirates made camp. Those pirates sure picked the right place ... but the wrong time to get drunk."

# DRAGON TURTLE WYRMLING

Wyrmlings are newly-hatched up to 6-month-old dragon turtles. They are often encountered near sandy beaches and shallow waters. Only a few survive to an adolescent age, as they are often killed on sight by larger dragon turtles, other sea monsters, and various humanoids that hunt them for their tough shells which they use to build shields with.

#### DRIDER SORCERER AND WARLOCK

Some drow were sorcerers and warlocks before they were cursed and transformed into driders. While most lose their powers and memories of their former drow selves, a rare few manage to retain their abilities, making them dangerous opponents. Whether this was willed by Lolth or not, it's anyone's guess.

Because they still retain memories of a portion of their lives, they grow to hate the drow that have forsaken them. Thus, these drider spellcasters wander off into the Underdark to find their own lair and live like hermits. They will not hesitate to attack anyone or anything that enters their territory, even drow.

Grant Wish (3/year). The djinni can grant a wish spell to a creature that isn't a genie. In order to work, the djinni must be willing to grant the wish.

The djinni can't grant a wish purposely to serve its own needs.

Elemental Demise. If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.

Innate Spellcasting. The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 20). The djinni can innately cast the following spells, without providing material components:

Magic Resistance. The djinni has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

# ACTIONS

Multiattack. The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

Scimitar. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice) and the target can't take reactions until the end of the djinni's next turn.

Create Whirlwind. A 10-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 22 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

# LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The djinni can take three legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The djinni regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Scimitar. The djinni makes a scimitar attack.

- Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions). The djinni casts a spell from its list of innate spells, using a spell slot as normal.
- Teleport (Costs 2 Actions). The djinni magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
- Tornado Form (Costs 3 Actions). The djinni magically transforms into a violent, twisting tornado and moves up to half its flying speed in a straight line and targets each creature its space it enters without provoking opportunity attacks. Each target must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, 9 (2d8) lightning damage, and 9 (2d8) thunder damage and is flung up 30 feet away from the djinni in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone. If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone. The djinni reverts to its true form at the start of the next turn.

# DINNI WIND WARDEN

Wind wardens are guardians and protectors of the djinni and their holdings. They are often found in temples and in the Citadel of Ice and Steel where they serve as personal bodyguards of the Great Caliph. Sometimes, they are sent on missions to the Material Plane to retrieve an item or to exact justice, which may lead them to ask help from, or bring them into conflict, with adventurers.

# EFREETI SULTAN

All efreet are led by the powerful and terrifying Sultan, who seldom leaves from his ruby and diamond palace in the City of Brass in the Elemental Plane of Fire. He spends most of his time scheming and planning with the noble efreeti on how to conquer and expand the sultanate.

As a true primary genie, he is able to bestow wishes. He almost never does though.

The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

#### REACTIONS

Intercept Attack. In response to another creature within 5 feet of it being hit by an attack roll, the djinni gives that creature a +5 bonus to its AC against that attack, potentially causing a miss. To use this ability, the djinni must be able to see the creature and the attacker.

# GHOSTS

Presented here are examples of ghost characters: the ghost knight, ghost necromancer, and ghost warlock.

# GHOST KNIGHT

When a knight has fallen before it was able to fulfill its life long quest or was cursed after performing an evil deed, it may rise as a ghost. Unfortunately, these poor souls often either become insane or lose memories of their past life after they transition to undeath.

# GHOST KNIGHT

Medium undead, any alignment

#### Armor Class 11 Hit Points 66 (12d8+12) Speed 0 ft., fly 40 ft. (hover)

Damage Immunities cold, necrotic, poison

Condition Immunities charmed, exhaustion, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11 Languages any languages it knew in life Challenge 5 (1,800 XP)

Ethereal Sight. The ghost can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

Incorporeal Movement. The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if thev were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

# ACTIONS

Multiattack. The ghost makes two withering blade attacks.

Withering Blade. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (2d6) slashing damage plus 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage.

Etherealness. The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

Horrifying Visage. Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 x 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

Possession. One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

# REACTIONS

Parry. The ghost adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

#### GHOST SPELLCASTERS

When an ambitious necromancer or warlock dies after attempting the ritual of lichdom, it may sometimes rise as a ghost. Driven by hate and anger, it becomes insane, blaming everyone else but itself for its failure.

Aberrant Ground. The ground in a 15-foot radius around the horror is doughlike difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.

Gibbering. The horror babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn't incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the horror and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such an attack.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The gibbering horror uses Engulf. It then makes two Pseudopod Bite attacks, and if it can, uses its Blinding Spittle.

Pseudopod Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (3d8 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled (escape DC 12). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the horror can't use the same pseudopod bite on another target. If the horror starts its turn grappling with a creature, it can use a bonus action to pull that creature within 5 feet of it.

Blinding Spittle. The horror spits a chemical glob at a point it can see within 20 feet of it. The glob explodes in a blinding flash of light on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the flash must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the horror's next turn.

Engulf. The horror moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Medium or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the horror enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the horror. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, the horror enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 29 (6d8 +2) piercing damage and is engulfed. While engulfed, the creature is blinded, can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) acid damage at the start of each of the horror's turns. If the target is killed by this damage, it is absorbed into the horror. When the horror moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 13 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the horror. The horror can have only up to two Medium or small creatures engulfed at a time.

Female Dominance. All male gnolls obey the matriarch's commands unquestioningly. The matriarch's daughters obey her for as long as she is still the physically strongest in the group. However, once she shows signs of weakness, the most dominant of the daughters may challenge her right to the throne, or simply murder her outright.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the golem can automatically hit the target with its slam attack but can't use one of its slam attacks against other targets.

Fling. One object held or creature that is smaller than the golem and is grappled by the golem is thrown up to 30 feet towards a target space and knocked prone. If a thrown creature strikes a solid surface, the creature takes 6 bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the creature is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes the same damage and is knocked prone.

A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

# STONE GOLEM SENTINEL

Twice as large as the normal stone golem, these giants are thankfully very rare due to the cost and time to make one. They are mostly found guarding main temples, archmage towers, and royal crypts. In combat, they can slam the ground to create a miniature shockwave that can hit multiple nearby foes.

# IRON GOLEM JUGGERNAUT

Even mightier than the iron golem, the juggernaut is at least 20 feet tall. It is so massive that during combat, it merely crushes its opponents by stepping on them. Thankfully, it is very rare as only the wealthiest and most powerful can afford to have one created.

# Xvim

During his reign, he deliberately implanted his Essence into predatory and evil-natured beasts, monstrosities, and aberrations. This transformed the creatures into strong, fiendish abominations. His clergy saw them as physical manifestations of his power and will. Despite his death in 1372 DR when his father consumed his body to return from death, his essence continued to linger throughout the realms. Once in a while, especially when one of his fanatical followers makes a sacrifice to him, another beast of Xvim is born to wreak havoc amongst the enemies of Xvim and Bane. Whether it is the dead Xvim himself or Bane granting the transformation is anybody's guess.

# ACTIONS

Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its Strength score reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

Change Shape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The hag magically polymorphs into any beast of CR 4 or less, remaining in that form for up to 1 hour. It can revert to its true form as a bonus action. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

Illusory Appearance. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

Invisible Passage. The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

Maddening Cackle (Recharge 5-6). Each creature within 30 feet of the hag and able to hear the hag must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 15 (3d8 + 2) psychic damage, and must use its reaction to move up to half its speed and make a melee weapon attack against one creature of the hag's choice that the hag can see. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.

When Tiamat's second coming was thwarted by a group of adventurers, it was the beginning of the end of the sudden rise of the Cult of the Dragon as forces of the Lord's Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Harpers systematically struck each of the cult's main lairs. A small faction of the cult managed to escape the Sword Coast and fled to the Chultan peninsula, carting off with them several dozen unhatched dragon eggs. As they began building a foothold in one of the jungles, they experimented combining the dragon eggs with dinosaur ones to create halfdragon dinosaurs which would serve them as guard drakes.

The spell targets the chosen creature instead of the battle horror. If the spell forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.

At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken cold damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 12 hit points for each head regrown in this way.

Reactive Heads. For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.

Wakeful. While the hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.

# JACKALWERES

# THUG

A typical jackalwere would never attack in the open and will always prefer a more subtle way to get at its intended victims. A jackalwere thug, on the other hand, does not have the patience and will simply ambush its prey or overwhelm it through sheer numbers. They are still cowards though, and flee if they feel they cannot win the fight without it costing a lot.

They almost always serve the lamia, but some have been employed by night hags, mummy lords, and oni lords.

Dark Whispers. The jackalwere can use a bonus action on its turn to target one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the jackalwere, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the jackalwere by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the Dash action. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the jackalwere, the creature can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

#### DECEIVER

A few jackalwere exhibit uncanny intelligence, and develop a talent for deception and the performance of the arts. They become bards and are sent to the College of Whispers by their masters. With their new abilities, they are used for the more complex missions of assassination, spreading false information, sabotage, and spying.

A jackalwere deceiver will never put itself at risk unneccessarily, such as fighting in the open. It will always try to outwit or negotiate its way out of a bind. But if caught, it will defend itself with its spells and abilities.

On a failed save, the target succumbs to a magical slumber, falling unconscious for 10 minutes or until someone uses an action to shake the target awake. A creature that successfully saves against the effect is immune to this jackalwere's gaze for the next 24 hours. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by it.

#### REACTIONS

Vexing Howl (Recharge 4-6). When a creature within 30 feet of the jackalwere, is visible to the jackalwere, and can hear the jackalwere makes an attack roll but before the outcome is determined, the jackalwere can impose disadvantage to the creature's attack roll. If the attack misses, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take 13 (3d8) psychic damage and is knocked prone.

If the kraken takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or

Once the most alluring mortal in the known world, she believed she was even more beautiful than the gods.

Her very blood is poisonous, and when it hits the ground, a swarm of snakes spring from it and attack her foes.

Blood of the Serpents. A creature that hits the medusa with a melee attack that deals piercing or slashing damage and is within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) poison damage. Additionally, a swarm of snakes (MM p.338) appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the medusa, and acts as an ally of the medusa.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the medusa fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Petrifying Gaze. When a creature that can see the medusa's eves starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.

Sorcery Points. The medusa has 12 sorcery points. It can spend 1 or more sorcery points to gain one of the following benefits:

Heightened Spell: When the medusa casts a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist the spell's effects, the medusa can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell.

Quickened Spell: When the medusa casts a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, the medusa can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

The minotaur berserker is a ferocious combatant able to charge recklessly into a throng of foes, hoping to cleave through several of them with its massive greataxe. Even after it is struck with a fatal blow, the minotaur can still make one final lunging strike at its attacker before dropping dead.

# SAVAGE BULL OF BAPHOMENT

On very rare instances, Baphomet the Prince of Beasts would instill its essence in a minotaur. It would transform into what is called a Savage Bull of Baphomet - a poweful, feral version of the minotaur.

Challenge 8 (3,900 XP)

Aura of Dread. A creature hostile to the cauchemar that starts its turn within 20 feet of the cauchemar must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, unless the cauchemar is incapacitated. On a failed save, the target is frightened until the start of its next turn. While frightened in this way, the target can't perform any actions except move up to half its speed. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cauchemar's Aura of Dread for the next 24 hours.

Confer Fire Resistance. The cauchemar can grant resistance to fire damage to anyone riding it.

Illumination. The cauchemar sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.

# ACTIONS

Multiattack. The cauchemar makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its hooves.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage.

Hooves. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage.

Sulfur Breath (Recharge 5-6). The cauchemar exhales nauseating sulfurous smoke in a 15-foot cone. The smoke spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage and spends its action on each of its turns retching and reeling for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to fire automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not suffer any other effects.

# NOTHICS

# EYE OF VECNA

An eye of Vecna was once a necromancer wizard who tirelessly sought the secrets of Lichdom. In the end, it failed and was cursed to become a dark and grotesque form of nothic. It can cause a creature's flesh to decay and rot with a mere stare.

This movement provokes opportunity attacks. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.

Weird Insight. The nothic targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against the nothic's Wisdom (Insight) check. If the nothic wins, it magically learns one fact or secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to being charmed.

# NIGHT HAUNTER

The night haunter is an insidious oni that prefers to slay its victims in their sleep.

The Bogeyman. The oni night haunter begins by assuming a humanoid form appropriate to its surroundings, and befriends a fellow traveler before entering a town or village. After successfully injecting itself into a community and winning the trust of the people around it, it starts haunting them one by one in their dreams. It prioritizes targeting the children first, as these are its favorite to devour. Only when it has slain one using its Nightmare Haunting ability does it materialize and feast on the victim's corpse. It continues to repeat this process until it has slain and devoured as many victims as it can before attracting unwanted attention to itself.

Soul Devourer. The oni devours the souls of the victims it has slain through its Nightmare Haunting. Only through a wish spell, or by slaying the oni, can the victims' souls be free and willing to be resurrected.

# ACTIONS

Multiattack. The oni makes two attacks, either with its claws or with its morningstar.

Morningstar. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

Claw (Oni Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a

creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or fal unconscious. The creature remains unconscious for 1 minute, or until it takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake.

Change Shape. The oni magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium humanoid, into a Large giant, or back into its true form. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. The only equipment that is transformed is its glaive, which shrinks so that it can be wielded in humanoid form . If the oni dies, it reverts to its true form, and its morningstar reverts to its normal size.

Nightmare Haunting (1/Day). While on the Ethereal Plane, the oni magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and the oni gains 3d10 temporary hit points. The oni's temporary hit points last for 12 hours. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

#### REACTIONS

Fade into Mist (Recharge 5-6). When hit by an attack roll, the attack instead misses and the oni turns into a gaseous form and moves up to 60 feet away to an unoccupied space it can see. While in this form, the oni can enter the space of another creature and has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.

While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. It remains in this form until the start of its next turn.

# ONI MAGI

Oni magi are advanced oni that have improved combat and spellcasting abilities. These oni prefer to recruit, unite, and command humanoid and giant tribes against civilized folk with the aim of enslaving and devouring them. They are often found working with ogres, trolls, and hill giants.

When encountered, it appears friendly and accommodating, offering real food and its home as a safe refuge to spend the night. It will even offer healing to any wounded, providing them with healing salves. Once it has earned the trust of its would-be victims, the oni yamauba then finds ways to draw out and divide the group.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured.

Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be stunned until the end of the otyugh's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't stunned.

# REACTIONS

Lifeleech. When a creature within 30 feet of the otyugh is targeted by a spell that allows the creature to regain hit points, it instead targets the otyugh. If an otyugh regains hit points as a result of this, it gains advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws until the end of its next turn.

# REACTIONS

Meat Shield. The otyugh uses its grappled victims as a shield against melee attacks. If the grappled creature is Medium or smaller, the otyugh adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. If the grappled creature is Large, the otyugh adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. If the attack misses the otyugh as a result, the melee attack instead hits the grappled creature. To do so, the otyugh must see the attacker and must be grappling with a creature.

# NEO-OTYUGH

The neo-otyugh is larger, more cunning, and very dangerous when compared to the normal otyugh. Its horrendous, foul-smelling bloated mass is nearly 15 feet in diameter.

Meat Shield. After it has successfully grappled a victim caught by its tentacle, the neo-otyugh can use it as a shield against an impending melee hit. This results in the attack hitting the victim instead of the otyugh.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Reel. The urophion pulls each creature grappled by it up to 30 feet straight toward it.

# UROPHION

When a roper is infected with an illithid tadpole, it transforms into a urophion. They are created by the mind flayers to serve as guards.

A urophion sees itself as intelligent equals to the mind flayer, but are treated as social outcasts and are usually shunned and ignored by other illithids. This may cause some urophion to become insane. Others may escape their servitude, and wander off into the Underdark. If they encounter an intelligent creature, they may not automatically be hostile, as it longs to have a decent conversation. That is, until it begins to crave its brain.

# RUST MONSTER

# DIRE RUST MONSTER

Of the most feared creatures a group of adventurers will ever face, the dire rust monster is probably one of the few they will dread the most.

Unlike the more common rust monster, the dire rust monster has the ability to corrode magical metal, such as weapons and armor. In fact, it prefers and relishes such items as it has a more unique taste than the common nonmagical metal.

# SCARECROW

#### ELDRITCH SCARECROW

The scarecrow is normally created by its animator after it has summoned and bound an evil spirit to it. But on very rare occasions, the evil spirit summoned is that of a restless and vengeful warlock or hag. As soon as it is bound to the scarecrow, it becomes an eldritch scarecrow, and it is free to do its will. The first thing it normally does is destroy its animator. If the animator is stronger, it will bide its time, acting as a normal scarecrow, until it has the upper hand. As soon as the eldritch scarecrow is free, it sets out and plans its revenge on those that have slain it.

A creature whose space the sphinx enters must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 5 feet to the nearest space out of the sphinx's path. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage and falls prone. If the sphinx remains in the prone creature's space, the creature is also restrained until it's no longer in the same space as the sphinx. While restrained in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 18 Strength check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the sphinx and is no longer restrained.

# HIERACOSPHINX

The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.

While their diet now consists mostly of fish and aquatic reptiles, they still prefer and relish humanoid flesh, especially human and elven flesh.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the umber hulk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the umber hulk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

Pounce. If the umber hulk moves at least 30 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the umber hulk can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

Stink Spray (Recharge 5-6). The umber hulk emits nauseating acid in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 27 (6d8) acid damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. A poisoned target spends its turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe ar are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.

# MALISON JUNGLESTALKER

The yuan-ti malison junglestalker is an exceptional ranger and gifted archer. It is able to slither through the densest jungle without difficulty while remaining nearly invisible to the naked eye.

# YUGOLOTH

# BAERNOLOTH

This horrid and lanky creature stands 9-foot tall and weighs about 500 pounds. Its gaunt oversized head looks like that of a horse's skull, with thin skin barely covering it. Necrotic ooze drips from its foul maw. Disgusting warts and pus-filled sores riddle its leathery hide. Its gangly limbs end in terrible claws that can rip flesh like knife through butter.

Reclusive Lords. It is said that the baernoloths were the first yugoloths, or were the creators of the yugoloths. Whether that is true or not, the baernoloth all but vanished, leaving the ultroloths in charge. The baernoloths went to the Gray Waste, and now live as reclusive hermits in well-guarded towers. They no longer interact with other yugoloths, except for ultroloths, who pay tribute to them, in return for the baernoloth's wisdom and guidance. Ultroloths may command armies of yugoloths, but it is the baernoloths that secretly provide direction to the ultroloths.

Collector of Secrets. Not unlike arcanoloths, baernoloths collect secret lores and answers to mysteries that they can use for their own ends. They also appear to know more about other fiends; in particular, their strengths and weaknesses that they can exploit. It is often for this reason that ultroloths seek them out.

Fiendish Sadists. If there is one thing that baernoloths love more than acquiring secrets, it is to torture intelligent beings. Even when they are trying to extract information, witnessing intense agony and fear from their victims appears to give them more satisfaction than acquiring the information itself. So much so that they bring back their victims from the brink of death by curing them fully of their wounds, only to repeat the torture once again.

# ACTIONS

Multiattack. The baernoloth makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

Teleport. The baernoloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

Mass Pain Echo (Recharge 5-6). Each creature within 60 feet of the baernoloth takes psychic damage equal to the amount of damage it took from the baernoloth's last melee attack that hit it within the past 24 hours and must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the baernoloth's next turn.

# LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The baernoloth can take three legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The baernoloth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Claw. The baernoloth makes a claw attack.

Bite (Costs 2 Actions). The baernoloth makes a bite attack.

Teleport (Costs 2 Actions). The baernoloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The greenvise makes three attacks: one with its bite attack and two with its tendrils.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the greenvise. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the greenvise, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the greenvise's turns.

If the greenvise takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the greenvise must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the greenvise.

On a failed save, the target takes 7 (2d6) acid damage, can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. The greenvise is immune to the effects of its death fog.

Multiattack. The spider makes three attacks: two with its forelegs and one with its bite.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Foreleg. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage.

Deadly Leap. If the spider jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 27 (5d8 + 5) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the spider's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is with in range, the creature instead falls prone in the spider's space.

# OVER 330 PAGES AND 475 NEW CREATURE STAT BLOCKS!

Monster Manual Expanded is a 330-page source of content that supplements the Monster Manual. It provides Dungeon Masters more options and flexibility in designing adventures and dressing up their dungeons with a wider variety of critters and characters that are based on the Monster Manual. It also adds over 470 new creatures and variants that give a nostalgic and classic feel that Dungeon Masters experienced with the older editions will enjoy using.

"A fantastic resource for DMs that want to keep players on their toes or want stronger or weaker variants of certain monsters."

- Comicbook.com

"Monster Manual Expanded does a fantastic job of lovingly recreating monsters that were sadly missing from 5e."

- Nerdimmersion

"The variants are more than additional stats for DMs to memorize; they are reference materials that enhance the known lore of beloved creatures, giving more clues to their ecological life histories and/or societal structures."

- Bob World Builder

"The creativity and attention to detail that went into this already makes it must have companion to your MM."

- D&D Character Lab

"It gives you a wealth of options at various levels which just creates more replayability. Very well done! Well worth your money!"
