Pr eface
O NCE UPON A TIME, LONG, LONG AGO, IN A
realm called the Midwestern United 
States—specifically the states o f M inne­
sota and W isconsin—a group of friends 
gathered together to forever alter the 
history o f gaming.
It wasn’t their intent to do so. They were 
tired of merely reading tales about worlds of magic, 
monsters, and adventure. They wanted to play in those 
worlds, rather than observe them. That they went on 
to invent Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s , and thereby ignite a 
revolution in gaming that continues to this day, speaks 
to two things.
First, it speaks to their ingenuity and genius in fig­
uring out that gam es w ere the perfect way to explore 
w orlds that could not otherwise exist. Alm ost every 
m odern game, whether played on a digital device or 
a tabletop, ow es som e debt to D&D.
Second, it is a testament to the inherent appeal of the 
game they created. Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  sparked a 
thriving global phenomenon. It is the first roleplaying 
game, and it remains one of the best of its breed.
To play D&D, and to play it well, you don’t need to 
read all the rules, m em orize every detail of the game, 
or master the fine art o f rolling funny looking dice.
None of those things have any bearing on what’s best 
about the game.
W hat you need are two things, the first being friends 
with w hom  you can share the game. Playing gam es with 
your friends is a lot of fun, but D&D does som ething 
m ore than entertain.
Playing D&D is an exercise in collaborative creation. 
You and your friends create epic stories filled with ten­
sion and mem orable drama. You create silly in-jokes 
that make you laugh years later. The dice will be cruel 
to you, but you will soldier on. Your collective creativ­
ity will build stories that you will tell again and again, 
ranging from the utterly absurd to the stuff of legend.
If you don’t have friends interested in playing, don’t 
worry. There’s a special alchemy that takes place 
around a D&D table that nothing else can match. Play 
the game with som eone enough, and the two of youare likely to end up friends. It’s a cool side effect o f the 
game. Your next gaming group is as close as the nearest 
game store, online forum, or gaming convention.
The second thing you need is a lively imagination 
or, m ore importantly, the w illingness to use whatever 
imagination you have. You don’t need to be a master 
storyteller or a brilliant artist. You just need to aspire to 
create, to have the courage of som eone who is willing to 
build som ething and share it with others.
Luckily, just as D&D can strengthen your friendships, 
it can help build in you the confidence to create and 
share. D&D is a game that teaches you to look for the 
clever solution, share the sudden idea that can overcom e 
a problem, and push yourself to imagine what could be, 
rather than simply accept what is.
The first characters and adventures you create will 
probably be a collection of cliches. That’s true of every­
one, from  the greatest Dungeon Masters in history on 
down. A ccept this reality and move on to create the 
second character or adventure, which will be better, 
and then the third, w hich will be better still. Repeat that 
over the course of time, and soon you’ll be able to create 
anything, from  a character’s background story to an epic 
w orld of fantasy adventure.
Once you have that skill, it’s yours forever. Countless 
writers, artists, and other creators can trace their begin­
nings to a few pages o f D&D notes, a handful of dice, 
and a kitchen table.
Above all else, D&D is yours. The friendships you 
make around the table will be unique to you. The adven­
tures you embark on, the characters you create, the 
m em ories you m ake—these will be yours. D&D is your 
personal corner of the universe, a place where you have 
free reign to do as you wish.
G o forth now. Read the rules of the game and the 
story of its worlds, but always rem em ber that you are 
the one w ho brings them to life. They are nothing 
without the spark of life that you give them.

In t r o d u c t io n
Th e Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  r o l e p l a y in g  
game is about storytelling in w orlds of 
sw ords and sorcery. It shares elements 
with childhood gam es of make-believe. Like 
those games, D & D  is driven by im agina­
tion. It’s about picturing the towering castle 
beneath the stormy night sky and imagining 
how  a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges 
that scene presents.
Dungeon Master (DM): After passing through the 
craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east 
and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crum bling 
towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. 
They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, 
a wide chasm  gapes, disappearing into the deep 
fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm , 
leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard.
The chains o f the drawbridge creak in the wind, their 
rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop 
the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you 
from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting 
wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the 
entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors o f Castle 
Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into 
the courtyard.
Phillip (playing Gareth): I  want to look at the 
gargoyles. I  have a feeling they’re not just statues.
Amy (playing Riva): The drawbridge looks precarious?
I  want to see how sturdy it is. Do I  think we can cross 
it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?
Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure 
to the stories, a way of determining the consequences 
of the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve 
whether their attacks hit or m iss or whether their adven­
turers can scale a cliff, roll away from  the strike of a 
m agical lightning bolt, or pull off som e other dangerous 
task. Anything is possible, but the dice make som e out­
com es m ore probable than others.
Dungeon Master (DM): O K, one at a time. Phillip, 
you’re looking at the gargoyles?
Phillip: Yeah. Is there any hint they m ight be 
creatures and not decorations?
DM: Make an Intelligence check.
Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?
DM: Sure!
Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh. Seven.
DM: They look like decorations to you. And Amy,
Riva is checking out the drawbridge?In the Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game, each player 
creates an adventurer (also called a character) and 
teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). 
W orking together, the group might explore a dark dun­
geon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep 
in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious 
mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with 
other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover 
fabulous magic items and other treasure.
One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon 
Master (DM), the gam e’s lead storyteller and referee. 
The DM creates adventures for the characters, w ho nav­
igate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The 
DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, 
and the players decide what they want their adventurers 
to do. W ill they walk across the dangerously weathered 
drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to mini­
m ize the chance that som eone will fall if the drawbridge 
gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm ?
Then the DM determines the results of the adventur­
ers’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because 
the DM can im provise to react to anything the players 
attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure 
can be exciting and unexpected.
The game has no real end; when one story or quest 
wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing 
story called a campaign. Many people w ho play the 
game keep their cam paigns going for months or years, 
meeting with their friends every week or so to pick 
up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow 
in might as the cam paign continues. Each monster 
defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure 
recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also 
earns the adventurers new  capabilities. This increase 
in pow er is reflected by an adventurer’s level.
There’s no winning and losing in the Du n g e o n s  & 
Dr a g o n s  game—at least, not the way those terms are 
usually understood. Together, the D M  and the players 
create an exciting story o f bold adventurers who confront 
deadly perils. Som etim es an adventurer might com e to 
a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in 
by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can 
search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, 
or the player might choose to create a new character to 
carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure 
successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created 
a memorable story, they all win.
Worlds  of Ad ven tu re
The many worlds of the Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game 
are places o f m agic and monsters, of brave w arriors and 
spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation 
of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, 
and magic that make these w orlds unique.
The w orlds of the D u n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game exist 
within a vast cosm os called the multiverse, connected 
in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to 
other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane 
of Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within

this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many 
of them have been published as official settings for the 
D&D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Drag- 
onlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron 
settings are woven together in the fabric of the multi- 
verse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands 
more, created by generations of D&D players for their 
ow n games. And amid all the richness of the multiverse, 
you might create a w orld of your own.
All these worlds share characteristics, but each world 
is set apart by its ow n history and cultures, distinctive 
monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dun­
geons, and schem ing villains. S om e races have unusual 
traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun 
setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, 
and the elves are desert nomads. Som e worlds feature 
races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s war- 
forged, soldiers created and im bued with life to fight in 
the Last War. S om e worlds are dominated by one great 
story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role 
in the Dragonlance setting. But they’re all D&D worlds, 
and you can use the rules in this book  to create a char­
acter and play in any one of them.
Your DM might set the cam paign on one of these 
worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there 
is so much diversity am ong the worlds of D&D, you 
should check with your DM about any house rules that 
w ill affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dun­
geon Master is the authority on the campaign and its 
setting, even if the setting is a published world.
Using  This Bo o k
The Player’s Handbook  is divided into three parts.
Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the 
rules and guidance you need to make the character 
you’ll play in the game. It includes information on the 
various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and 
other customization options that you can choose from. 
Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 
and 3. If you com e across a game concept in part 1 that 
you don’t understand, consult the book ’s index.
Part 2 details the rules of how to play the game, 
beyond the basics described in this introduction. That 
part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine 
su ccess or failure at the tasks your character attempts, 
and describes the three broad categories o f activity in 
the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.
Part 3 is all about magic. It covers the nature of m agic 
in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and the 
huge variety o f spells available to magic-using charac­
ters (and monsters) in the game.
How t o Pla y
The play o f the Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game unfolds 
according to this basic pattern.
1. The DM describes the environment. The DM
tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s 
around them, presenting the basic scope of options that 
present themselves (how  many doors lead out of a room , 
what’s on a table, w ho’s in the tavern, and so on).2. The players describe what they want to do. S om e­
tim es one player speaks for the whole party, saying, 
“W e’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, 
different adventurers do different things: one adventurer 
might search a treasure chest w hile a second exam ines 
an esoteric sym bol engraved on a wall and a third keeps 
watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take 
turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides 
how  to resolve those actions.
Som etim es, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer 
wants to walk across a room  and open a door, the DM 
might just say that the door opens and describe what 
lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor 
might hide a deadly trap, or som e other circum stance 
might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete 
a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, 
often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results 
of an action.
3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’  
actions. D escribing the results often leads to another 
decision point, which brings the flow of the game right 
back to step 1.
This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cau­
tiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or 
locked in mortal com bat against a mighty dragon. In 
certain situations, particularly combat, the action is 
m ore structured and the players (and DM) do take turns 
choosing and resolving actions. But m ost of the time, 
play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circum stances 
o f the adventure.
Often the action of an adventure takes place in the 
imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM ’s 
verbal descriptions to set the scene. S om e DMs like to 
use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the 
m ood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different 
voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other 
characters they play in the game. Som etim es, a DM 
might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures 
to represent each creature involved in a scene to help 
the players keep track o f where everyone is.
Ga m e  D i c e  
The game uses polyhedral dice with different num bers 
o f sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and 
in many bookstores.
In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the 
letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d 10, 
d 12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the 
typical cube that many gam es use).
Percentile dice, or d 100, work a little differently. You 
generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two 
different ten-sided dice num bered from 0 to 9. One die 
(designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and 
the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for 
example, the number rolled is 71. Two Os represent 100. 
S om e ten-sided dice are num bered in tens (00, 10, 20, 
and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit 
from  the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, 
and 00 and 0 is 100.
W hen you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how 
many dice to roll o f a certain type, as well as what m od­
ifiers to add. For example, “3d8 + 5 ” m eans you roll

three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 
to the total.
The sam e d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” 
and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and 
divide the num ber rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate 
the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll 
depending on whether it w as odd or even. (Alternatively, 
if the number rolled is m ore than half the number of 
sides on the die, it’s a 2.)
T h e  D 2 0 
D oes an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just 
bounce off its iron-hard scales? W ill the ogre believe an 
outrageous bluff? Can a character sw im  across a raging 
river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, 
or does he or she take full damage from  the blaze? In 
cases w here the outcom e of an action is uncertain, 
the Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game relies on rolls o f a 
20-sided die, a d20, to determine su ccess or failure.
Every character and monster in the game has capa­
bilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are 
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, W isdom , 
and Charisma, and they typically range from  3 to 18 
for m ost adventurers. (M onsters might have scores as 
low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the 
ability modifiers derived from  them, are the basis for 
almost every d20 roll that a player m akes on a charac­
ter’s or m onster’s behalf.
Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the 
three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the 
rules of the game. All three follow  these simple steps.
1. Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and 
add the relevant modifier. This is typically the m od­
ifier derived from  one of the six ability scores, and it 
som etim es includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a char­
acter’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each 
ability and how  to determine an ability’s modifier.)
2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A 
class feature, a spell, a particular circum stance, or som e 
other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total 
equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, 
attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s 
a failure. The DM is usually the one w ho determines 
target num bers and tells players whether their ability 
checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.
The target number for an ability check or a saving 
throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target 
number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).
This simple rule governs the resolution of m ost tasks 
in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides m ore detailed rules for 
using the d20 in the game.
Ad v a n t a g e  a n d  D i s a d v a n t a g e
Som etim es an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw 
is m odified by special situations called advantage and 
disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circum ­
stances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage 
reflects the opposite. W hen you have either advantage or 
disadvantage, you roll a second d20 w hen you make the 
roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advan­
tage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage.
For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and 
a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll 
those numbers, you use the 17.
M ore detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage 
are presented in chapter 7.
Sp e c i f i c  B e a t s  G e n e r a l
This book  contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, 
that govern how  the game plays. That said, many racial 
traits, class features, spells, m agic items, monster abili­
ties, and other game elements break the general rules in 
som e way, creating an exception to how  the rest o f the 
game works. Rem em ber this: If a specific rule contra­
dicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.
Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, 
many adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows, 
but every w ood  elf does because of a racial trait. That 
trait creates a m inor exception in the game. Other 
exam ples of rule-breaking are m ore conspicuous. For 
instance, an adventurer can’t normally pass through 
walls, but som e spells make that possible. Magic 
accounts for m ost o f the major exceptions to the rules.
Ro u n d  D o w n
There’s one m ore general rule you need to know  at the 
outset. W henever you divide a number in the game, 
round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the 
fraction is one-half or greater.
Ad v e n tu r e s
The Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game consists of a group 
o f characters embarking on an adventure that the Dun­
geon Master presents to them. Each character brings 
particular capabilities to the adventure in the form  of 
ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, 
equipment, and m agic items. Every character is dif­
ferent, with various strengths and w eaknesses, so the 
best party o f adventurers is one in w hich the characters 
com plem ent each other and cover the w eaknesses of

their com panions. The adventurers must cooperate to 
successfully com plete the adventure.
The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with 
a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might 
be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the 
shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM ’s needs and 
desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic 
setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crum ­
bling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city.
It features a rich cast o f characters: the adventurers 
created and played by the other players at the table, 
as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). T hose char­
acters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or 
just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of 
the NPCs is a villain w hose agenda drives much of an 
adventure’s action.
Over the course of their adventures, the characters 
are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and 
situations that they must deal with in som e way. S om e­
times the adventurers and other creatures do their 
best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other 
times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even 
a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the 
adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass 
an obstacle, find som ething hidden, or unravel the cur­
rent situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the 
world, making decisions about which way to travel and 
what they’ll try to do next.
Adventures vary in length and complexity. A  short 
adventure might present only a few challenges, and 
it might take no m ore than a single game session to 
complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of 
combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take 
dozens o f sessions to play through, stretching over 
w eeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an 
adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to 
civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.
But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of 
an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made 
up of multiple exciting scenes. A cam paign is the whole 
series—a string o f adventures joined together, with a 
consistent group of adventurers following the narrative 
from start to finish.
Th e T h r e e  P i l l a r s  o f A d v e n t u r e
Adventurers can try to do anything their players can 
imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activ­
ities in three broad categories: exploration, social 
interaction, and combat.
Exploration includes both the adventurers’ movement 
through the w orld and their interaction with objects and 
situations that require their attention. Exploration is the 
give-and-take of the players describing what they want 
their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling 
the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, 
that might involve the characters spending a day cross­
ing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through 
caverns underground. On the sm allest scale, it could 
mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room  to 
see what happens.
Social interaction features the adventurers talking to 
som eone (or som ething) else. It might mean demandingthat a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the 
goblin lair, getting information from  a rescued prisoner, 
pleading for mercy from  an orc chieftain, or persuading 
a talkative magic m irror to show  a distant location to 
the adventurers.
The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and 
social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 
and personality traits in chapter 4.
Combat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters 
and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, 
maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort 
to defeat their opponents, whether that m eans killing 
every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat 
is the most structured element o f a D&D session, with 
creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets 
a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, 
there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to 
attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs 
on a shield, to exam ine the environment (perhaps by 
pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other 
creatures, including allies, enem ies, and neutral parties.
Th e W o n d e r s  o f M a g i c
Few D&D adventures end without som ething magical 
happening. W hether helpful or harmful, m agic appears 
frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus 
of chapters 10 and 11.
In the w orlds of Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s , practitioners 
of magic are rare, set apart from  the m asses o f people 
by their extraordinary talent. Com m on folk might see 
evidence of m agic on a regular basis, but it’s usually 
m inor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, 
a w izard walking through the streets with an animated 
shield guardian as a bodyguard.
For adventurers, though, m agic is key to their sur­
vival. Without the healing m agic of clerics and paladins, 
adventurers w ould quickly succum b to their wounds. 
Without the uplifting magical support of bards and 
clerics, w arriors might be overwhelmed by powerful 
foes. Without the sheer magical pow er and versatility 
of w izards and druids, every threat w ould be mag­
nified tenfold.
Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adven­
tures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters 
w ho are hellbent on using magic for som e ill end. A cult 
leader seeks to awaken a god w ho slum bers beneath 
the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them 
o f their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of 
automatons with a facsim ile of life, a dragon begins a 
mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—these 
are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers 
might face. With magic o f their own, in the form  of 
spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!

Chapter  1: S tep -by-Step Characters
 OUR FIRST STEP IN PLAYING AN ADVENTURER IN THE
 Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game is to imagine
 and create a character of your own. Your
 character is a com bination of game statistics, 
roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You 
ch oose a race (such as human or halfling) and
a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also
invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of 
your character. O nce completed, your character serves 
as your representative in the game, your avatar in the 
Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  world.
Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the 
kind o f adventurer you want to play. You might be a 
courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or 
a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be m ore interested 
in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue 
w ho likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who 
picks off enem ies from  afar. D o you like fantasy fiction 
featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of 
one of those races. D o you want your character to be the 
toughest adventurer at the table? Consider a class like 
barbarian or paladin. If you don’t know  where else to 
begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see 
what catches your interest.
O nce you have a character in mind, follow  these steps 
in order, making decisions that reflect the character you 
want. Your conception of your character might evolve 
with each choice you make. W hat’s important is that you 
com e to the table with a character you’re excited to play.
Throughout this chapter, w e use the term character  
sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, 
whether it’s a form al character sheet (like the one at the 
end of this book), som e form  of digital record, or a piece 
of notebook paper. An official D&D character sheet is a 
fine place to start until you know  what information you 
need and how  you use it during the game.
Bu i l d i n g  Br u e n o r
Each step o f character creation includes an example of 
that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf 
character, Bruenor.
1. C h o o s e  a Ra c e
Every character belongs to a race, one of the many 
intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The 
m ost com m on player character races are dwarves, elves, 
halflings, and humans. Som e races also have subraces,  
such as mountain dw arf or w ood elf. Chapter 2 provides 
m ore inform ation about these races, as well as the less 
widespread races of dragonborn, gnom es, half-elves, 
half-orcs, and tieflings.
The race you choose contributes to your character’s 
identity in an important way, by establishing a general 
appearance and the natural talents gained from culture 
and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular 
racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with 
certain w eapons or tools, proficiency in one or m ore 
skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits 
som etim es dovetail with the capabilities of certainclasses (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of 
lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and 
high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Som etim es 
playing against type can be fun, too. Half-orc paladins 
and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be 
unusual but memorable characters.
Your race also increases one or m ore of your ability 
scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these 
increases and rem em ber to apply them later.
Record the traits granted by your race on your 
character sheet. Be sure to note your starting 
languages and your base speed as well.
Bu i l d i n g  Br u e n o r , St e p  1
B ob is sitting dow n to create his character. He decides 
that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants 
to play. He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his 
character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the 
languages he knows: Com m on and Dwarvish.
2. C h o o s e  a Cl a s s  
Every adventurer is a m em ber of a class. Class broadly 
describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he 
or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is m ost likely 
to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, 
or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character 
classes are described in chapter 3.
Your character receives a number of benefits from 
your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class  
features— capabilities (including spellcasting) that set 
your character apart from  m em bers of other classes.
You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, 
w eapons, skills, saving throws, and som etim es tools. 
Your proficiencies define many o f the things your 
character can do particularly well, from  using certain 
w eapons to telling a convincing lie.
On your character sheet, record all the features that 
your class gives you at 1st level.
Le v e l
Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances 
in level by adventuring and gaining experience points  
(XP). A  1st-level character is inexperienced in the 
adventuring world, although he or she might have been 
a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.
Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry 
into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar 
with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D 
campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a 
higher level, on the assumption that your character has 
already survived a few harrowing adventures.
Qu ic k  Bu il d
Each class description in chapter 3  includes a  section 
offering suggestions to quickly build a  character of that 
class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, 
a background suitable to the class, and starting spells.
PART 1  S T E P -B Y -S T E P  CH ARACTERS

Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re 
starting at a higher level, record the additional elements 
your class gives you for your levels past 1st. A lso record 
your experience points. A  1st-level character has 0 
X P  A  higher-level character typically begins with the 
minim um  amount of X P  required to reach that level 
(see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter).
Hi t Po i n t s  a n d  H i t Dic e
Your character’s hit points define how  tough your 
character is in com bat and other dangerous situations. 
Your hit points are determined by your Hit D ice (short 
for Hit Point Dice).

points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in 
your class description. (You also add your Constitution 
modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also 
your hit point maximum.
R ecord your character’s hit points on your character 
sheet. Also record the type o f Hit Die your character 
uses and the number of Hit D ice you have. After you 
rest, you can spend Hit D ice to regain hit points (see 
“Resting” in chapter 8).
Pr o f i c i e n c y  Bo n u s
The table that appears in your class description shows 
your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level 
character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the 
num bers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:
•  Attack rolls using w eapons you’re proficient with
•  Attack rolls with spells you cast
•  Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
•  Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
•  Saving throws you’re proficient in
•  Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in 
each spellcasting class)
Your class determ ines your w eapon proficiencies, 
your saving throw proficiencies, and som e of your skill 
and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, 
tools in chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional 
skill and tool proficiencies, and som e races give 
you m ore proficiencies. Be sure to note all o f these 
proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your 
character sheet.
Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die 
roll or other num ber m ore than once. Occasionally, your 
proficiency bonus might be m odified (doubled or halved, 
for example) before you apply it. If a circum stance 
suggests that your proficiency bonus applies m ore than 
once to the sam e roll or that it should be multiplied 
m ore than once, you nevertheless add it only once, 
multiply it only once, and halve it only once.
Bu i l d i n g  Br u e n o r , St e p  2
Bob im agines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, 
one horn on his helmet broken off. He m akes Bruenor a 
fighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level 
class features on his character sheet.
As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit D ie—a d 10— 
and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution 
modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final 
number after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution 
score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus 
for a 1st-level character, which is +2.
3.  D e t e r m i n e  A b i l i t y  S c o r e s
Much of what your character does in the game depends 
on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity,  
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
Each ability has a score, which is a num ber you record 
on your character sheet.
The six abilities and their use in the game are 
described in chapter 7. The Ability S core Sum m ary

table provides a quick reference for what qualities 
are m easured by each ability, what races increases 
which abilities, and what classes consider each ability 
particularly important.
You generate your character's six ability scores  
randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of 
the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. D o 
this five m ore times, so that you have six numbers. If 
you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly 
determining ability scores, you can use the following 
scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
N ow  take your six num bers and write each number 
beside one o f your character’s six abilities to assign 
scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, 
W isdom , and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes 
to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.
After assigning your ability scores, determine 
your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and 
M odifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without 
consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score 
and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the 
modifier next to each of your scores.
Bu i l d i n g  Br u e n o r , St e p  3
Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14,
13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’s a fighter, 
he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next- 
highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a 
brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dw arf to 
be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent 
scores in W isdom  and Charisma. After applying his 
racial benefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by
2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and 
modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 
(+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), W isdom  13 
(+1), Charisma 12 (+1).
Bob fills in Bruenor's final hit points: 10 + his 
Constitution m odifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.
Va r i a n t : C u s t o m i z i n g  Ab i l i t y  Sc o r e s
At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this 
variant for determining your ability scores. The method 
described here allows you to build a character with a set 
of ability scores you choose individually.
You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. 
The cost of each score is show n on the Ability Score 
Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 
points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score 
you can end up with, before applying racial increases. 
You can’t have a score lower than 8.
This method of determining ability scores enables 
you to create a set o f three high num bers and three low 
ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set o f num bers that are above

set of num bers betw een those extremes.
4. D e s c r i b e  Y o u r  C h a r a c t e r
Once you know the basic game aspects of your 
character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. 
Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes 
thinking about what he or she looks like and how  he or 
she behaves in general terms.
Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out 
your character’s physical appearance and personality 
traits. Choose your character’s alignment (the moral 
com pass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals.  
Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things your 
character holds m ost dear, called bonds, and the flaws  
that could one day undermine him or her.
Your character’s background describes where he or 
she cam e from, his or her original occupation, and the 
character’s place in the D&D world. Your DM might 
offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included
Score Cost Score Cost
8 0 12 4
9 1 1 3 5
10 2 1 4 7
11 3 1 5 9

in chapter 4, and might be willing to w ork with you to 
craft a background that’s a m ore precise fit for your 
character concept.
A background gives your character a background 
feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in tw o skills, 
and it might also give you additional languages or 
proficiency with certain kinds of tools. R ecord this 
information, along with the personality information 
you develop, on your character sheet.
Yo u r  Ch a r a c t e r ’s Ab i l i t i e s
Take your character’s ability scores and race into 
account as you flesh out his or her appearance 
and personality. A  very strong character with low 
Intelligence might think and behave very differently 
from  a very smart character with low  Strength.
For example, high Strength usually corresponds 
with a burly or athletic body, while a character with 
low  Strength might be scrawny or plump.
A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and 
slim, while a character with low  Dexterity might be 
either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.
A  character with high Constitution usually looks 
healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A 
character with low  Constitution might be sickly or frail.
A  character with high Intelligence might be highly 
inquisitive and studious, while a character with low 
Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.
A  character with high W isdom  has good judgment, 
empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on.
A  character with low  W isdom  might be absent-minded, 
foolhardy, or oblivious.
A  character with high Charisma exudes confidence, 
which is usually m ixed with a graceful or intimidating 
presence. A  character with a low  Charisma might com e 
across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.
Bu i l d i n g  Br u e n o r , St e p  4
B ob fills in som e of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, 
his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment 
(lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution 
suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low  Intelligence 
suggests a degree of forgetfulness.
Bob decides that Bruenor com es from  a noble line, 
but his clan was expelled from  its homeland when 
Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith 
in the rem ote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor 
has a heroic destiny—to reclaim  his hom eland—so 
B ob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf.
He notes the proficiencies and special feature this 
background gives him.
Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality 
in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in 
the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is 
a caring, sensitive dw arf w ho genuinely loves his friends 
and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, 
snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness 
from  the list in his background, noting that Bruenor 
believes that no one is above the law.
Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he 
aspires to som eday reclaim  Mithral Hall, his homeland, 
from  the shadow  dragon that drove the dwarves out.His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a 
soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to 
show  m ercy even w hen it might not be warranted.
5.  C h o o s e  E q u i p m e n t  
Your class and background determine your character's 
starting equipment, including w eapons, armor, and 
other adventuring gear. R ecord this equipment on your 
character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5.
Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class 
and background, you can purchase your starting 
equipment. You have a num ber of gold pieces (gp) 
to spend based on your class, as show n in chapter 5. 
Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in 
that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket 
at no cost (see the trinket table at the end o f chapter 5).
Your Strength score limits the amount o f gear you can 
carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight 
(in pounds) exceeding your Strength score tim es 15. 
Chapter 7 has m ore inform ation on carrying capacity.
Ar m o r  Cl a s s
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how  w ell your 
character avoids being w ounded in battle. Things that 
contribute to your AC include the arm or you wear, the 
shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all 
characters w ear arm or or carry shields, however.
Without arm or or a shield, your character’s AC equals 
10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character 
w ears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your 
AC using the rules in chapter 5. R ecord your AC on 
your character sheet.
Your character needs to be proficient with arm or and 
shields to w ear and use them effectively, and your arm or 
and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. 
There are drawbacks to wearing arm or or carrying a 
shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained 
in chapter 5.
Som e spells and class features give you a different 
way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features 
that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you 
choose which one to use.
We a p o n s
For each w eapon your character wields, calculate the 
modifier you use w hen you attack with the w eapon and 
the damage you deal when you hit.
W hen you make an attack with a weapon, you roll 
a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you 
are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate 
ability modifier.
•  For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength 
m odifier for attack and damage rolls. A  weapon that 
has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your 
Dexterity m odifier instead.
•  For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity 
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A  w eapon that 
has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use 
your Strength modifier instead.

Bu i l d i n g  Br u e n o r , St e p  5
Bob writes down the starting equipment from  the 
fighter class and the folk hero background. His starting 
equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which 
com bine to give Bruenor an Arm or Class of 18.
For Bruenor’s w eapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe 
and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, 
so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks 
and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier 
(+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5.
The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor 
adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he 
hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. W hen 
throwing a handaxe, Bruenor has the sam e attack bonus 
(handaxes, as thrown w eapons, use Strength for attacks 
and damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing 
damage when it hits.
6.  C o m e  T o g e t h e r
M ost D & D  characters don’t w ork alone. Each character 
plays a role within a party, a group of adventurers 
working together for a com m on purpose. Teamwork 
and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances 
to survive the many perils in the w orlds o f D u n g e o n s  
&  D r a g o n s . Talk to your fellow players and your DM 
to decide whether your characters know one another, 
how  they met, and what sorts of quests the group 
might undertake.
Be yo n d  1st Level
A s your character goes on adventures and overcom es 
challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by 
experience points. A character w ho reaches a specified 
experience point total advances in capability. This 
advancement is called gaining a level.
W hen your character gains a level, his or her class 
often grants additional features, as detailed in the 
class description. S om e of these features allow you 
to increase your ability scores, either increasing two 
scores by 1  each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t 
increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every 
character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.
Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit 
Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier 
to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. 
Alternatively, you can use the fixed value show n in your 
class entry, which is the average result of the die roll 
(rounded up).
W hen your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your 
hit point m aximum increases by 1 for each level you have 
attained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level 
as a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from  17 
to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from  +3 
to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.
The Character Advancement table sum m arizes the 
X P  you need to advance in levels from  level 1  through 
level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that 
level. Consult the information in your character’s class 
description to see what other improvements you gain 
at each level.Tie r s  o f Pl a y  
The shading in the Character Advancement table shows 
the four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules 
associated with them; they are a general description of how 
the play experience changes as characters gain levels.
In the first tier (levels 1-4), characters are effectively 
apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features 
that define them as m em bers of particular classes, 
including the major choices that flavor their class 
features as they advance (such as a w izard’s Arcane 
Tradition or a fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats 
they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to 
local farmsteads or villages.
In the second tier (levels 5-10), characters com e into 
their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level 
spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of 
m agical pow er with spells such as fireball  and lightning  
bolt.  At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the 
ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These 
characters have becom e important, facing dangers that 
threaten cities and kingdom s.
In the third tier (levels 11-16), characters have 
reached a level of pow er that sets them high above 
the ordinary populace and m akes them special even 
am ong adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters 
gain access to 6th-level spells, som e of which create 
effects previously im possible for player characters to 
achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them 
to make m ore attacks or do m ore im pressive things with 
those attacks. These mighty adventurers often confront 
threats to whole regions and continents.
At the fourth tier (levels 17-20), characters achieve 
the pinnacle of their class features, becom ing heroic (or 
villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the 
world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse 
might hang in the balance during their adventures.

Ch apter  2: R aces
A  VISIT TO ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES IN THE
w orlds of Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s — 
Waterdeep, the Free City of Greyhawk, or 
even uncanny Sigil, the City o f D oors— 
overwhelm s the senses. Voices chatter in 
countless different languages. The sm ells 
of cooking in dozens o f different cuisines 
mingle with the odors of crow ded streets and poor 
sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles 
display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.
And the people them selves—people of varying size, 
shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum  
of styles and hues—represent many different races, 
from  diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to 
majestically beautiful elves, mingling am ong a variety 
of human ethnicities.
Scattered am ong the m em bers of these m ore com m on 
races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, 
pushing his way through the crow d, and a sly tiefling 
there, lurking in the shadows with m ischief in her eyes. 
A group o f gnom es laughs as one of them activates a 
clever w ooden toy that m oves of its ow n accord. Half- 
elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, 
without fully belonging to the races of either of their 
parents. And there, w ell out of the sunlight, is a lone 
drow —a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of 
the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world 
that fears his kind.
Ch o o s in g  a Race
Humans are the m ost com m on people in the w orlds of 
D&D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, 
halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your 
character belongs to one of these peoples.
Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is 
appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, 
elves, halflings, and humans are the m ost com m on 
races to produce the sort of adventurers w ho make up 
typical parties. Dragonborn, gnom es, half-elves, half- 
orcs, and tieflings are less com m on as adventurers. 
Drow, a subrace of elves, are also uncom m on.
Your choice o f race affects many different aspects of 
your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that 
exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. 
W hen making this decision, keep in mind the kind of 
character you want to play. For example, a halfling could 
be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dw arf m akes a 
tough warrior, and an elf can be a master o f arcane magic.
Your character race not only affects your ability scores 
and traits but also provides the cues for building your 
character’s story. Each race’s description in this chapter 
includes inform ation to help you roleplay a character of 
that race, including personality, physical appearance, 
features o f society, and racial alignment tendencies. 
These details are suggestions to help you think about 
your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the 
norm  for their race. It’s worthwhile to consider why your 
character is different, as a helpful way to think about 
your character’s background and personality.Ra c i a l  Tr a i t s
The description of each race includes racial traits that 
are com m on to m em bers of that race. The following 
entries appear am ong the traits of most races.
Ab i l i t y  Sc o r e  In c r e a s e
Every race increases one or m ore of a character’s
ability scores.
Ag e
The age entry notes the age when a m em ber o f the race 
is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected 
lifespan. This information can help you decide how  
old your character is at the start of the game. You 
can choose any age for your character, w hich could 
provide an explanation for som e of your ability scores. 
For example, if you play a young or very old character, 
your age could explain a particularly low  Strength or 
Constitution score, while advanced age could account 
for a high Intelligence or W isdom .
Al i g n m e n t
Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, 
described in this entry. These are not binding for player 
characters, but considering why your dw arf is chaotic, 
for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help 
you better define your character.
Siz e
Characters of m ost races are Medium, a size category 
including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. 
M em bers of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet 
tall), which m eans that certain rules of the game affect 
them differently. The m ost important o f these rules 
is that Sm all characters have trouble w ielding heavy 
w eapons, as explained in chapter 6.
Sp e e d
Your speed determines how  far you can move when 
traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).
La n g u a g e s
By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, 
and write certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the most 
com m on languages of the D&D multiverse.
Su b r a c e s
S om e races have subraces. M em bers of a subrace 
have the traits of the parent race in addition to the 
traits specified for their subrace. Relationships am ong 
subraces vary significantly from  race to race and 
w orld to world. In the Dragonlance cam paign setting, 
for example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves live 
together as different clans of the sam e people, but in 
the Forgotten Realms, they live far apart in separate 
kingdom s and call themselves shield dwarves and 
gold dwarves, respectively.

Sh o r t  a n d St o u t
Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as 
skilled warriors, miners, and workers 
of stone and metal. Though they stand 
well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so 
broad and compact that they can weigh 
as much as a human standing nearly two 
feet taller. Their courage and endurance 
are also easily a match for any of 
the larger folk.
Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler 
hue tinged with red, but the most com m on shades are 
light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. 
Their hair, w orn long but in simple styles, is usually 
black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have 
red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and 
groom  them carefully.
Lo n g  M e m o r y ,  L o n g  G r u d g e s
Dwarves can live to be m ore than 400 years old, so the 
oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very different 
world. For example, som e of the oldest dwarves living 
in Citadel Felbarr (in the w orld of the Forgotten Realms) 
can recall the day, m ore than three centuries ago, when 
orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile 
that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a 
perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as 
humans and halflings lack.
Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains 
they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic 
endurance and little change. They respect the traditions 
of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the 
founding o f their m ost ancient strongholds in the youth 
of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. 
Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the 
dwarves, w ho uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious 
labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.
Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to 
their w ord and decisive in action, som etim es to the point 
of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong senseK ingdom s rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the 
roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and ham m ers 
in deep m ines and blazing forges, a com m itm ent to 
clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and 
orc s—these com m on threads unite all dwarves.“Y e r  l a t e , e l f !” c a m e  t h e  r o u g h  e d g e  o f a f a m i l i a r  
voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his  
dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay  
on top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discomfort,  
the dwarf’ s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray-  
streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome  
sight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d f ind ye in trouble if I came out  
an' looked for ye!"
—R. A . Salvatore, The Crystal ShardDw arf

o f justice, and they are slow  to forget w rongs they have 
suffered. A  w rong done to one dw arf is a w rong done to 
the dw arf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dw arf’s 
hunt for vengeance can becom e a full-blown clan feud.
Cl a n s  a n d  K i n g d o m s  
Dwarven kingdom s stretch deep beneath the mountains 
where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals 
and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and 
artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in som e 
dwarves this love festers into avarice. W hatever wealth 
they can’t find in their mountains, they gain through 
trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and 
halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods 
along water routes. Trustworthy m em bers of other races 
are w elcom e in dw arf settlements, though som e areas 
are off limits even to them.
The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and 
dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves 
w ho live far from  their ow n kingdom s cherish their clan 
identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, 
and invoke their ancestors’ nam es in oaths and curses. 
To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.
Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, 
especially weaponsm iths, armorers, and jew elers. Som e 
becom e m ercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after 
for their courage and loyalty.
Go d s ,  G o l d ,  a n d  C l a n
D warves w ho take up the adventuring life might be 
motivated by a desire for treasure—for its ow n sake, for 
a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to 
help others. Other dwarves are driven by the com m and 
or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a 
desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and 
ancestry are also important motivators. A  dw arf might 
seek to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient 
w rong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the 
clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search 
for the axe w ielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field 
of battle centuries ago.Sl o w  t o Tr u s t
Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. “The 
difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a 
hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, 
but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of 
a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust.
Elves.  “ It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what 
an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s head, 
they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a  sword. They’re 
flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: 
They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very 
fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down 
out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have at your back. Not 
as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs 
as much as we do.”
Halflings.  “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me a 
halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure 
for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you 
take them seriously?”
Humans.  “You take the time to get to know a human, and 
by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, she’s 
got kin— a daughter or granddaughter, maybe— who’s got 
hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can make 
a human friend. And watch them go! They set their hearts on 
something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s hoard or an 
empire’s throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, 
even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.”

Dw a r f  N a m e s  
A  dw arf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance 
with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been 
used and reused down through the generations. A 
dw arf’s nam e belongs to the clan, not to the individual.
A  dw arf w ho m isuses or brings sham e to a clan name 
is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any 
dwarven name in its place.

Dw a r f  T r a i t s
Your dwarf character has an assortm ent of inborn 
abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.
Ability Score Increase.  Your Constitution score 
increases by 2.
Age.  D warves mature at the sam e rate as humans, but 
they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. 
On average, they live about 350 years.
Alignment.  M ost dwarves are lawful, believing firmly 
in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend 
toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and 
a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of 
a just order.
Size.  D warves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and 
average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.
Speed.  Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your 
speed is not reduced by w earing heavy armor.
Darkvision.  A ccustom ed to life underground, you 
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You 
can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it w ere dim light. You 
can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Dwarven Resilience.  You have advantage on saving 
throws against poison, and you have resistance against 
poison damage (explained in chapter 9).
Dwarven Combat Training.  You have proficiency 
with the battleaxe, handaxe, throwing hammer, 
and warhammer.Tool Proficiency.  You gain proficiency with the 
artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brew er’s 
supplies, or m ason’s tools.
Stonecunning.  W henever you make an Intelligence 
(History) check related to the origin of stonework, you 
are considered proficient in the History skill and add 
double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of 
your norm al proficiency bonus.
Languages.  You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and 
guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into 
whatever other language a dw arf might speak.
Subrace.  Two main subraces o f dwarves populate the 
worlds of D&D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves. 
Choose one of these subraces.
Hi l l Dw a r f
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, 
and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerun 
in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as 
are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in 
the Dragonlance setting.
Ability Score Increase.  Your W isdom  score 
increases by 1.
Dwarven Toughness.  Your hit point maximum 
increases by 1, and it increases by 1  every time you 
gain a level.
Mo u n t a i n  Dw a r f
A s a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy, 
accustom ed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re 
probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward 
lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of northern 
Faerun, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble 
Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.
Ability Score Increase.  Your Strength score 
increases by 2.
Dwarven Armor Training.  You have proficiency with 
light and medium armor.
Du e r g a r
In cities deep in the Underdark live the duergar, or gray 
dwarves. These vicious, stealthy slave traders raid the surface 
world for captives, then sell their prey to the other races of 
the Underdark. They have innate magical abilities to become 
invisible and to temporarily grow to giant size.

Elf
“ I HAVE NEVER IM AG IN ED  SUCH  BEAU TY EXISTED ,”
Goldmoon said softly. The day’s march had been difficult,  
but the reward at the end was beyond their dreams.
The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled  
city of Qualinost.
Four slender spires rose from the city’ s corners like glisten-  
ing spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining  
silver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared  
through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths,  
they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet  
they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might  
overthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the  
city’ s only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost.  
The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness.
—M argaret W eis & Tracy H ickm an, 
Dragons of Autumn Twilight
Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living 
in the w orld but not entirely part of it. They live in 
places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests 
or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where 
soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances 
waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art 
and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things 
of the world.
Sl e n d e r  a n d  G r a c e f u l
With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves 
appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and m em bers 
of many other races. They are slightly shorter than 
humans on average, ranging from  well under 5 feet 
tall to just over 6 feet. They are m ore slender than 
humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. M ales andfemales are about the same height, and males are only 
marginally heavier than females.
Elves’ coloration encom passes the normal human 
range and also includes skin in shades of copper, 
bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, 
and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no 
facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in 
bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.
A  T i m e l e s s  P e r s p e c t i v e
Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad 
perspective on events that might trouble the shorter- 
lived races m ore deeply. They are m ore often amused 
than excited, and m ore likely to be curious than 
greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty 
happenstance. W hen pursuing a goal, however, whether

adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, 
elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow  to 
make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget 
them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to 
serious insults with vengeance.
Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible 
in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and 
com prom ise to resolve differences before they escalate 
to violence. They have been known to retreat from 
intrusions into their w oodland hom es, confident 
that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when 
the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, 
demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.
Hi d d e n  W o o d l a n d  R e a l m s
M ost elves dwell in small forest villages hidden am ong 
the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow 
vegetables, and their skill and m agic allow them to 
support themselves without the need for clearing and 
plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely 
worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with 
outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a 
good living by trading crafted items for m etals (which 
they have no interest in mining).
Elves encountered outside their ow n lands are 
com m only traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human 
nobles com pete for the services of elf instructors to 
teach swordplay or m agic to their children.
Ex p l o r a t i o n  a n d  A d v e n t u r e
Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since 
they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of 
exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of 
human society, which is regimented from  day to day but 
constantly changing over decades, so they find careers 
that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves 
also enjoy exercising their martial prow ess or gaining 
greater magical power, and adventuring allows themto do so. S om e might join  with rebels fighting against 
oppression, and others might becom e cham pions of 
moral causes.
El f N a m e s  
Elves are considered children until they declare 
themselves adults, som e time after the hundredth 
birthday, and before this period they are called 
by child names.
On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, 
although those w ho knew him or her as a youngster 
might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult 
name is a unique creation, though it might reflect 
the nam es o f respected individuals or other family 
m em bers. Little distinction exists between male 
nam es and female names; the groupings here reflect 
only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a 
family name, typically a com bination of other Elvish 
words. Som e elves traveling am ong humans translate 
their family nam es into Com m on, but others retain the 
Elvish version.

Ha u g h t y  b u t  Gr a c io u s
Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious 
even to those who fall short of their high expectations— 
which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just 
about anyone.
Dwarves.  “ Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they 
lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up in 
valor. And I  must admit, their best smiths produce art that 
approaches elven quality.”
Halflings.  “ Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and 
that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care 
for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven 
themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises."
Humans.  “All that haste, their ambition and drive to 
accomplish something before their brief lives pass away— 
human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then 
you look at what they have accomplished, and you have to 
appreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down 
and learn some refinement.”

El f T r a i t s
Your elf character has a variety o f natural abilities, the 
result o f thousands o f years of elven refinement.
Ability Score Increase.  Your Dexterity score 
increases by 2.
Age.  Although elves reach physical maturity at about 
the sam e age as humans, the elven understanding of 
adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encom pass 
worldly experience. An elf typically claim s adulthood 
and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live 
to be 750 years old.
Alignment.  Elves love freedom , variety, and self- 
expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler 
aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' 
freedom  as well as their own, and they are more 
often good than not. The drow  are an exception; their 
exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and 
dangerous. D row  are m ore often evil than not.
Size.  Elves range from  under 5 to over 6 feet tall and 
have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
Speed.  Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Darkvision.  Accustom ed to twilit forests and the night 
sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. 
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it 
w ere bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. 
You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Keen Senses.  You have proficiency in the 
Perception skill.
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on saving throws 
against being charm ed, and m agic can’t put you to sleep.Trance.  Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they 
meditate deeply, remaining sem iconscious, for 4 
hours a day. (The Com m on w ord for such meditation 
is “trance.”) W hile meditating, you can dream  after a 
fashion; such dream s are actually mental exercises that 
have becom e reflexive through years of practice. After 
resting in this way, you gain the sam e benefit that a 
human does from 8 hours of sleep.
Languages.  You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and 
intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, 
and their songs and poem s are fam ous am ong other 
races. Many bards learn their language so they can add 
Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
Subrace.  Ancient divides am ong the elven people 
resulted in three main subraces: high elves, w ood elves, 
and dark elves, w ho are com m only called drow. Choose 
one of these subraces. In som e worlds, these subraces 
are divided still further (such as the sun elves and m oon 
elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can 
choose a narrower subrace.
Hi g h  El f
As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of 
at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds 
of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type 
(which includes the gray elves and valley elves of

Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow 
would be universally reviled. To most, they are a race of 
demon-worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean 
depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest 
nights to pillage and slaughter the surface dwellers they 
despise. Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the 
favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, who sanctions murder 
and the extermination of entire families as noble houses 
vie for position.
Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In  the world of the 
Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do'Urden, ranger of the North, has 
proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak 
and innocent. Rejecting his heritage and adrift in a world that 
looks upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a model 
for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying to find 
a life apart from the evil society of their Underdark homes.
Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are 
inferior, worthless except as slaves. Drow who develop a  
conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members of 
other races find it hard to overcome that prejudice, especially 
when they are so often on the receiving end of hatred.Da r k  El f ( D r o w )
D escended from  an earlier subrace of dark-skinned 
elves, the drow  were banished from the surface world 
for following the goddess Lolth down the path to 
evil and corruption. N ow they have built their own 
civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned 
after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow 
have black skin that resem bles polished obsidian and 
stark white or pale yellow  hair. They com m only have 
very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in 
shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to 
be smaller and thinner than m ost elves.
Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist 
in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see 
if you can play a drow  character.

amply thickened by his love of a good meal, or several, as  
the opportunities presented themselves. The crooked stick  
that served as his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched  
between two of his toes, and hung out over the quiet lake,  
mirrored perfectly in the glassy surface o f Maer Dualdon.

marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire 
and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. 
Though som e halflings live out their days in remote 
agricultural com m unities, others form nom adic bands 
that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the 
wide horizon to discover the w onders of new lands and 
peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, 
hearth, and home, though hom e might be a wagon 
jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.
Sm a l l  a n d  P r a c t i c a l
The diminutive halflings survive in a w orld full of larger 
creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding 
offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively 
harm less and so have managed to survive for centuries 
in the shadow  of em pires and on the edges o f wars and 
political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing 
between 40 and 45 pounds.
Halflings’ skin ranges from  tan to pale with a ruddy 
cast, and their hair is usually brow n or sandy brown 
and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men 
often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare am ong 
them and mustaches even m ore so. They like to wear 
simple, com fortable, and practical clothes, favoring 
bright colors.
Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. 
They’re concerned with basic needs and simple 
pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the 
wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a 
cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have 
a knack for finding the most straightforward solution 
to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.
Ki n d  a n d  C u r i o u s
Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They 
cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well 
as the com forts of hearth and home, harboring few 
dream s of gold or glory. Even adventurers am ong 
them usually venture into the w orld for reasons of

Af f a b l e  a n d  Po s it iv e
community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They 
love discovering new things, even simple things, such 
as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.
Halflings are easily m oved to pity and hate to see any 
living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing 
what they have even in lean times.
Bl e n d  i n t o  t h e  C r o w d  
Halflings are adept at fitting into a com m unity of 
humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable 
and w elcom e. The com bination of their inherent stealth 
and their unassum ing nature helps halflings to avoid 
unwanted attention.
Halflings w ork readily with others, and they are loyal 
to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can 
display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, 
or com m unities are threatened.
Pa s t o r a l  Pl e a s a n t r i e s
M ost halflings live in small, peaceful com m unities with 
large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build 
kingdom s o f their ow n or even hold much land beyond 
their quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any 
sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to 
family elders to guide them. Fam ilies preserve their 
traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.
Many halflings live am ong other races, where the 
halflings’ hard w ork and loyal outlook offer them 
abundant rewards and creature com forts. S om e halfling 
com m unities travel as a way of life, driving w agons or 
guiding boats from  place to place and maintaining no 
permanent home.Halflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to 
make sweeping generalizations— especially negative ones.
Dwarves.  “Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count 
on them to keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile 
once in a while?”
 Elves.  "They’re so beautiful! Their faces, their music, their 
grace and all. It’s like they stepped out of a wonderful dream. 
But there’s no telling what’s going on behind their smiling 
faces— surely more than they ever let on.”
Humans.  “ Humans are a lot like us, really. At least some 
of them are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to the 
farmers and herders and you’ll find good, solid folk. Not that 
there’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers—you 
have to admire their conviction. And by protecting their own 
lands, they protect us as well.”
Ex p l o r i n g  O p p o r t u n i t i e s
Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to 
defend their communities, support their friends, or 
explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, 
adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or 
som etim es a necessity.
Ha l f l i n g  N a m e s
A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly 
a nicknam e. Family nam es are often nicknam es that 
stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down 
through the generations.

Languages.  You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but 
halflings are loath to share it with others. They write 
very little, so they don’t have a rich body o f literature. 
Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Alm ost all 
halflings speak Com m on to converse with the people 
in w hose lands they dwell or through which they 
are traveling.
Subrace.  The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and 
stout, are m ore like closely related fam ilies than true 
subraces. C hoose one of these subraces.
Li g h t f o o t
As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from  notice, 
even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be 
affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten 
Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and 
thus are the most com m on variety.
Lightfoots are m ore prone to wanderlust than other 
halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take 
up a nom adic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these 
halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows.

long ago took to the seas and rivers in longboats, first to  
pillage and terrorize, then to settle. Yet there was an energy,  
a love of adventure, that sang from every page. Long into  
the night Uriel read, lighting candle after precious candle.
She'd never given much thought to humans, but these  
stories fascinated her. In these yellowed pages were tales of  
bold heroes, strange and fierce animals, mighty primitive gods,  
and a magic that was part and fabric of that distant land.
—Elaine C u n n in gh am , Daughter of the Drow
In the reckonings o f most worlds, humans are the 
youngest of the com m on races, late to arrive on the 
world scene and short-lived in com parison to dwarves, 
elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter 
lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in 
the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have 
som ething to prove to the elder races, and that’s why 
they build their mighty em pires on the foundation of 
conquest and trade. W hatever drives them, humans 
are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers 
of the worlds.
A  B r o a d  Sp e c t r u m
With their penchant for migration and conquest, 
hum ans are m ore physically diverse than other com m on 
races. There is no typical human. An individual can 
stand from  5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh 
from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range 
from  nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from  
black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); m ales might 
sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A  lot of humans 
have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, 
orc , or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their 
late teens and rarely live even a single century.Va r i e t y  i n A l l Th i n g s
Humans are the m ost adaptable and ambitious people 
am ong the com m on races. They have widely varying 
tastes, morals, and custom s in the many different lands 
where they have settled. W hen they settle, though, 
they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and 
great kingdom s that can persist for long centuries. An 
individual human might have a relatively short life span, 
but a human nation or culture preserves traditions 
with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s 
memory. They live fully in the present—making them 
well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the 
future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and 
as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and 
they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.

Ev e r y o n e ’s Se c o n d -Be s t Fr ie n d s
Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle 
with members of other races. They get along with almost 
everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans 
serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, 
and functionaries of all kinds.
Dwarves.  “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to 
their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.”
Elves.  “It’s best not to wander into elven woods. They don't 
like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as peppered 
with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial 
pride and actually treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot 
from them.”
Halflings.  "It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, as 
long as you don’t crack your head on the ceiling— good food 
and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If halflings had 
a shred of ambition, they might really amount to something.”
La s t i n g  In s t i t u t i o n s
W here a single elf or dw arf might take on the 
responsibility o f guarding a special location or a 
pow erful secret, humans found sacred orders and 
institutions for such purposes. W hile dw arf clans and 
halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each 
new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, 
and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of 
history. Humans dream  of immortality, but (except for 
those few w ho seek undeath or divine ascension to 
escape death’s clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that 
they will be rem em bered when they are gone.
Although som e humans can be xenophobic, in 
general their societies are inclusive. Human lands 
w elcom e large num bers of nonhumans com pared to the 
proportion of humans w ho live in nonhuman lands.
Ex e m p l a r s  o f A m b i t i o n
Humans w ho seek adventure are the m ost daring and 
ambitious m em bers of a daring and ambitious race.
They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows 
by am assing power, wealth, and fame. M ore than 
other people, humans cham pion causes rather than 
territories or groups.

Chondathans are slender, tawny-skinned folk with 
brown hair that ranges from alm ost blond to almost 
black. M ost are tall and have green or brown eyes, 
but these traits are hardly universal. Humans of 
Chondathan descent dominate the central lands of 
Faerun. around the Inner Sea.parents give their children nam es from  other languages, 
such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced m ore or less 
correctly), but most parents give nam es that are linked 
to their region’s culture or to the nam ing traditions of 
their ancestors.
The material culture and physical characteristics 
of humans can change wildly from  region to region.
In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, 
architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different 
in the northwestern lands of the Silver M arches than 
in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even 
m ore distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical 
characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient 
migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans 
of the Silver M arches have every possible variation of 
coloration and features.
In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups 
are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are 
found in m ore localized areas of Faerun. These groups, 
and the typical nam es o f their mem bers, can be used as 
inspiration no matter which world your human is in.

the indifference of a dragon, even to Farideh.

Born of dragons, as their name proclaim s, the 
dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets 
them with fearful incom prehension. Shaped by draconic 
gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally 
hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, com bining 
the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. S om e 
dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others 
form  the ranks o f soldiers in great wars, and still others 
find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
Pr o u d  D r a g o n  K in
Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect 
in humanoid form, though they lack w ings or a tail. The 
first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching 
the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of 
interbreeding have created a m ore uniform appearance. 
Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze 
in color, som etim es ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or 
copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often 
standing close to 6  1 / 2 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds 
or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike 
claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.
The blood of a particular type of dragon runs 
very strong through som e dragonborn clans. These 
dragonborn often boast scales that m ore closely match 
those of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, 
or white, lustrous black, or gleam ing metallic gold, 
silver, brass, copper, or bronze.

Se l f - S u f f i c i e n t  C l a n s
To any dragonborn, the clan is m ore important than 
life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect 
to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each 
dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her 
clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in 
expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn know s his or her 
station and duties within the clan, and honor demands 
maintaining the bounds of that position.
A  continual drive for self-improvement reflects the 
self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value 
skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, 
and they push them selves to extreme efforts before they 
give up on something. A  dragonborn holds mastery of 
a particular skill as a lifetime goal. M embers of other 
races w ho share the sam e com m itm ent find it easy to 
earn the respect o f a dragonborn.
Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, 
they recognize that help is som etim es needed in difficult 
situations. But the best source for such help is the 
clan, and w hen a clan needs help, it turns to another 
dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races— 
or even from  the gods.
Dr a g o n b o r n  N a m e s
D ragonborn have personal nam es given at birth, 
but they put their clan nam es first as a mark of 
honor. A childhood name or nicknam e is often used 
am ong clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term 
of endearment. The name might recall an event or 
center on a habit.

The dragonborn and the rest of the races in this chapter are 
uncommon. They don’t exist in every world of D&D, and 
even where they are found, they are less widespread than 
dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans.
In  the cosmopolitan cities of the D&D multiverse, most 
people hardly look twice at members of even the most 
exotic races. But the small towns and villages that dot 
the countryside are different. The common folk aren’t 
accustomed to seeing members of these races, and they 
react accordingly.
Dragonborn.  It’s easy to assume that a dragonborn is a  
monster, especially if his or her scales betray a chromatic 
heritage. Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and 
causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond 
with caution rather than outright fear.
Gnome.  Gnomes don’t look like a threat and can quickly 
disarm suspicion with good humor. The common folk are 
often curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one 
before, but they are rarely hostile or fearful.
Half-Elf.  Although many people have never seen a half-elf, 
virtually everyone knows they exist. A half-elf stranger’s 
arrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf's back and 
stolen glances across the common room, rather than any 
confrontation or open curiosity.
Half-Orc.  It’s usually safe to assume that a half-orc is 
belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch themselves 
around an unfamiliar half-orc. Shopkeepers might 
surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc 
comes in, and people slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a  
fight will break out soon.
Tiefling.  Half-orcs are greeted with a  practical caution, but 
tieflings are the subject of supernatural fear. The evil of their 
heritage is plainly visible in their features, and as far as most 
people are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil 
straight from the Nine Hells. People might make warding 
signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to avoid 
passing near, or bar shop doors before a tiefling can enter.

Age.  Young dragonborn grow  quickly. They walk 
hours after hatching, attain the size and development 
of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach 
adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.
Alignment.  Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a 
conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosm ic 
war between good and evil (represented by Bahamut 
and Tiamat, respectively). Most dragonborn are good, 
but those w ho side with Tiamat can be terrible villains.
Size.  Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, 
standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 
pounds. Your size is Medium.

in the Dragonlance setting, the followers of the evil goddess 
Takhisis learned a dark ritual that let them corrupt the 
eggs of metallic dragons, producing evil dragonborn called 
draconians. Five types of draconians, corresponding to the 
five types of metallic dragons, fought for Takhisis in the War 
of the Lance: auraks (gold), baaz (brass), bozak (bronze), 
kapak (copper), and sivak (silver). In place of their draconic 
breath weapons, they have unique magical abilities. 
Draconic Ancestry.  You have draconic ancestry. 
C hoose one type of dragon from  the D raconic Ancestry 
table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are 
determined by the dragon type, as show n in the table.
Breath Weapon.  You can use your action to exhale 
destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines 
the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.
W hen you use your breath weapon, each creature in 
the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, 
the type of which is determined by your draconic 
ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + 
your Constitution m odifier + your proficiency bonus. A 
creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half 
as much damage on a successful one. The damage 
increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 
at 16th level.
After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it 
again until you com plete a short or long rest.
Damage Resistance.  You have resistance to the 
damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.
Languages.  You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and D raconic. D raconic is thought to be one of the 
oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. 
The language sounds harsh to m ost other creatures and 
includes num erous hard consonants and sibilants.

Gn o m e
fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, 
as if expressing the gnom e’s insatiable interest in 
everything around.
A gnom e’s personality is writ large in his or her 
appearance. A male gnom e’s beard, in contrast to 
his wild hair, is kept carefully trim med but often 
styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnom e’s 
clothing, though usually m ade in m odest earth tones, 
is elaborately decorated with embroidery, em bossing, 
or gleam ing jewels.
De l i g h t e d  D e d i c a t i o n
As far as gnom es are concerned, being alive is a 
wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of 
enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. 
Humans might w onder about getting bored over the 
course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time 
to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but 
gnom es seem  to w orry that even with all that time, they 
can’t get in enough of the things they want to do and see.
Gnom es speak as if they can’t get the thoughts 
out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer 
ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still 
manage to listen carefully to others, adding the 
appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation 
along the way.Sk i n n y  a n d  f l a x e n -h a i r e d , h is s k i n

climb up on a stool to look out the peephole. Like most hab-  
itations in Oeble, that particular tenement had been built  
for humans, and smaller residents coped with the resulting  
awkwardness as best they could.
But at least the relative largeness of the apartment gave  
Burgell room to pack in all his gnome-sized gear. The front  
room was his workshop, and it contained a bewildering  
miscellany of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks,  
tinted lenses, jeweler's loupes, and jars of powdered and  
shredded ingredients for casting spells. A fat gray cat, the  
mage’ s familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire. It opened its  
eyes, gave Aeron a disdainful yellow stare, then appeared  
to go back to sleep.
—R ich ard Lee Byers, The Black Bouquet
A  constant hum o f busy activity pervades the warrens 
and neighborhoods where gnom es form  their close- 
knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: 
a crunch of grinding gears here, a m inor explosion 
there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially 
bursts of laughter. G nom es take delight in life, enjoying 
every mom ent of invention, exploration, investigation, 
creation, and play.
Vi b r a n t  Ex p r e s s i o n
A gnom e’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines 
through every inch of his or her tiny body. G nom es 
average slightly over 3 feet tall and w eigh 40 to 45 
pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned 
with broad sm iles (beneath their prodigious noses), 
and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their

Though gnom es love jokes o f all kinds, particularly 
puns and pranks, they’re just as dedicated to the m ore 
serious tasks they undertake. Many gnom es are skilled 
engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They’re 
willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in 
the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold 
(som etim es foolhardy) risks and dream ing large.
Br i g h t  Bu r r o w s
G nom es make their hom es in hilly, w ooded lands. They 
live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves 
do, enjoying the natural, living w orld on the surface 
whenever they can. Their hom es are well hidden by 
both clever construction and simple illusions. W elcom e 
visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm 
burrows. Those w ho are not w elcom e are unlikely to 
find the burrow s in the first place.
Gnom es w ho settle in human lands are com m only 
gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Som e human 
fam ilies retain gnom e tutors, ensuring that their pupils 
enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. 
A gnom e might tutor several generations of a single 
human family over the course of his or her long life.
Gn o m e  N a m e s
Gnom es love names, and most have half a dozen or so.
A  gnom e's mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles 
each give the gnom e a name, and various nicknam es 
from just about everyone else might or might not stick 
over time. Gnom e nam es are typically variants on the 
nam es of ancestors or distant relatives, though som e 
are purely new  inventions. W hen dealing with humans 
and others w ho are “stuffy” about names, a gnom e 
learns to use no m ore than three names: a personal 
name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in 
each category that’s the m ost fun to say.De e p  Gn o m e s
A third subrace of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or svirfneblin), 
live in small communities scattered in the Underdark. Unlike 
the duergar and the drow, svirfneblin are as good as their 
surface cousins. However, their humor and enthusiasm 
are dampened by their oppressive environment, and their 
inventive expertise is directed mostly toward stonework.

Se e i n g  t h e  W o r l d
Curious and impulsive, gnom es might take up 
adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love 
o f exploring. As lovers of gem s and other fine items, 
som e gnom es take to adventuring as a quick, if 
dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless o f what spurs 
them to adventure, gnom es w ho adopt this way of life 
eke as much enjoyment out o f it as they do out of any 
other activity they undertake, som etim es to the great 
annoyance of their adventuring com panions.

Alw a ys  Ap p r e c ia t iv e
It’s rare for a gnome to be hostile or malicious unless he 
or she has suffered a grievous injury. Gnomes know that 
most races don’t share their sense of humor, but they enjoy 
anyone's company just as they enjoy everything else they set 
out to do.

Size.  Gnom es are between 3 and 4 feet tall and 
average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
Speed.  Your base walking speed is 25 feet. 
Darkvision.  Accustom ed to life underground, you have 
superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can 
see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it w ere bright 
light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't 
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Gnome Cunning.  You have advantage on all 
Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma saving throws 
against magic.
Languages.  You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and Gnomish. The Gnom ish language, which uses the 
Dwarvish script, is renow ned for its technical treatises 
and its catalogs o f knowledge about the natural world.
Subrace.  Two subraces of gnom es are found am ong 
the worlds of D&D: forest gnom es and rock gnom es. 
C hoose one of these subraces.
Fo r e s t  Gn o m e
As a forest gnom e, you have a natural knack for illusion 
and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds of 
D&D, forest gnom es are rare and secretive. They gather 
in hidden com m unities in sylvan forests, using illusions 
and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or 
to m ask their escape should they be detected. Forest 
gnom es tend to be friendly with other good-spirited 
w oodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as 
their most important allies. These gnom es also befriend 
small forest animals and rely on them for information 
about threats that might prowl their lands.
Ability Score Increase.  Your Dexterity score 
increases by 1.
Natural Illusionist.  You know  the minor illusion  
cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
Speak with Small Beasts.  Through sounds and 
gestures, you can com m unicate simple ideas with Small 
or sm aller beasts. Forest gnom es love animals and often 
keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, m oles, w oodpeckers, 
and other creatures as beloved pets.
Ro c k  Gn o m e
As a rock gnom e, you have a natural inventiveness and 
hardiness beyond that of other gnom es. M ost gnom es 
in the worlds of D&D are rock gnom es, including the 
tinker gnom es of the Dragonlance setting.Ability Score Increase.  Your Constitution score 
increases by 1.
Artificer’s Lore.  W henever you make an Intelligence 
(History) check related to m agic items, alchemical 
objects, or technological devices, you can add tw ice your 
proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you 
normally apply.
Tinker.  You have proficiency with artisan’s tools 
(tinker’s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1  
hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny 
clockw ork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases 
to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour 
repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when 
you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can 
reclaim  the materials used to create it. You can have up 
to three such devices active at a time.
W hen you create a device, choose one of the 
following options:
Clockwork T oy. This toy is a clockw ork animal, monster, 
or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or 
soldier. W hen placed on the ground, the toy m oves 
5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a 
random direction. It makes noises as appropriate 
to the creature it represents.
Fire Starter.  The device produces a miniature 
flame, which you can use to light a candle, 
torch, or campfire. Using the device 
requires your action.
Music Box.  W hen opened, this music box 
plays a single song at a moderate volume.
The box stops playing when it 
reaches the son g’s end or 
when it is closed.

“Tanis?” said Flint hesitantly as the man neared.
“The same.” The newcomer’s bearded face split in a wide  
grin. He held open his arms and, before the dwarf could  
stop him, engulfed Flint in a hug that lifted him off the  
ground. The dwarf clasped his old friend close for a brief  
instant, then, remembering his dignity, squirmed and freed  
himself from the half-elf’ s embrace.

Dragons of Autumn Twilight
W alking in two w orlds but truly belonging to neither, 
half-elves com bine what som e say are the best qualities 
o f their elf and human parents: human curiosity, 
inventiveness, and ambition tem pered by the refined 
senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes o f the elves. 
S om e half-elves live am ong humans, set apart by their 
em otional and physical differences, watching friends 
and loved ones age while time barely touches them. 
Others live with the elves, grow ing restless as they 
reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while 
their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, 
unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary 
wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in 
the adventuring life.
Of Tw o  W o r l d s  
To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they 
look human. In height, they’re on par with both parents, 
though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad 
as humans. They range from  under 5 feet to about 6 feet 
tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly 
taller and heavier than wom en. Half-elf men do have 
facial hair, and som etim es grow  beards to m ask their 
elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie 
som ewhere between their human and elf parents, and 
thus show  a variety even m ore pronounced than that 
found am ong either race. They tend to have the eyes

Flint drew back into the shadow of a tall pine to see better.  
The man's walk was marked by an easy grace— an elvish  
grace, Flint would have said; yet the man’ s body had the  
thickness and tight muscles of a human, while the facial  
hair was definitely humankind’ s. All the dwarf could see  
of the man’ s face beneath a green hood was tan skin and a  
brownish-red beard. A longbow was slung over one shoulder  
and a sword hung at his left side. He was dressed in soft  
leather, carefully tooled in the intricate designs the elves  
loved. But no elf in the world o f Krynn could grow a beard

Di p l o m a t s  o r W a n d e r e r s
Half-elves have no lands o f their own, though they are 
w elcom e in human cities and som ewhat less w elcom e 
in elven forests. In large cities in regions w here elves 
and humans interact often, half-elves are som etim es 
num erous enough to form  small com m unities of their 
own. They enjoy the com pany of other half-elves, the 
only people w ho truly understand what it is to live 
between these two worlds.
In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are 
uncom m on enough that one might live for years 
without meeting another. S om e half-elves prefer to 
avoid com pany altogether, wandering the w ilds as 
trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting 
civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by 
the wanderlust that com es of their longevity. Others, 
in contrast, throw themselves into the thick o f society, 
putting their charisma and social skills to great use 
in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.
Ha l f - E l f N a m e s  
Half-elves use either human or elven naming 
conventions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really fit 
in to either society, half-elves raised am ong humans are 
often given elven names, and those raised am ong elves 
often take human names.

W hether united under the leadership of a mighty 
warlock or having fought to a standstill after years 
of conflict, orc and human tribes som etim es form 
alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror 
of civilized lands nearby. W hen these alliances are 
sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. S om e half-orcs 
rise to becom e proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human 
blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc 
rivals. Som e venture into the w orld to prove their worth 
am ong humans and other m ore civilized races. Many of 
these becom e adventurers, achieving greatness for their 
mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric custom s 
and savage fury.
Sc a r r e d  a n d  St r o n g  
Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, 
jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make 
their orcish heritage plain for all to see. H alf-orcs stand 
between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 
180 and 250 pounds.
Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and 
ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, 
though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or 
a disgraced exile. Any half-orc w ho has lived am ong 
or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of 
humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits 
and injuries. Such a half-orc living am ong humans might 
display these scars proudly or hide them in shame.

strong streak of human blood in him, and he found the  
daylight less bothersome than most of his tribe did. Among  
the Bloody Skulls, a warrior was judged by his strength, his  
fierceness, and his wits. Human ancestry was no blemish  
against a warrior— provided he was every bit as strong,  
enduring, and bloodthirsty as his full-blooded kin. Half-  
orcs who were weaker than their orc comrades didn't last  
long among the Bloody Skulls or any other orc tribe for  
that matter. But it was often true that a bit of human blood  
gave a warrior just the right mix of cunning, ambition, and  
self-discipline to go far indeed, as Mhurren had. He was  
master of a tribe that could muster two thousand spears,  
and the strongest chief in Thar.

them, whether they em brace it or rebel against it.
Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion 
powerfully. Rage doesn’t just quicken their pulse, it 
makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, 
and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly 
and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures—feasting, 
drinking, wrestling, drum ming, and wild dancing—fill 
their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered 
and som etim es sullen, m ore inclined to action than 
contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most 
accom plished half-orcs are those with enough self- 
control to get by in a civilized land.
Tr i b e s  a n d  Sl u m s
H alf-orcs most often live am ong orc s. Of the other races, 
hum ans are m ost likely to accept half-orcs, and half- 
orcs alm ost always live in human lands w hen not living 
am ong orc tribes. W hether proving themselves am ong 
rough barbarian tribes or scrabbling to survive in the 
slum s of larger cities, half-orcs get by on their physical 
might, their endurance, and the sheer determination 
they inherit from  their human ancestry.
Ha l f - O r c N a m e s
H alf-orcs usually have nam es appropriate to the culture 
in w hich they w ere raised. A  half-orc w ho wants to fit in 
am ong humans might trade an orc name for a human 
name. S om e half-orcs with human nam es decide to 
adopt a guttural orc nam e because they think it makes 
them m ore intimidating.
Male Orc Names: Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, 
Keth, Krusk, Mhurren, Ront, Shump, Thokk 
Female Orc Names: Baggi, Emen, Engong, Kansif, 
Myev, Neega, Ovak, Ownka, Shautha, Sutha, Vola, 
Volen, Yevelda
Ha l f - O r c T r a i t s
Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from 
your ore ancestry.hate orcs. Some are reserved, trying not to draw attention to 
themselves. A few demonstrate piety and good-heartedness 
as publicly as they can (whether or not such demonstrations 
are genuine). And some simply try to be so tough that others 
just avoid them.
Ability Score Increase.  Your Strength score 
increases by 2, and your Constitution score 
increases by 1.
Age.  Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, 
reaching adulthood around age 14. They age 
noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.
Alignment.  H alf-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos 
from  their orc parents and are not strongly inclined 
toward good. Half-orcs raised am ong ores and willing 
to live out their lives am ong them are usually evil.
Size.  H alf-orcs are som ewhat larger and bulkier than 
humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. 
Your size is Medium.
Speed.  Your base w alking speed is 30 feet.
Darkvision.  Thanks to your orc blood, you have 
superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can 
see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it w ere bright 
light, and in darkness as if it w ere dim light. You can't 
discern color in darkness, only shades o f gray.
Menacing.  You gain proficiency in the 
Intimidation skill.
Relentless Endurance.  W hen you are reduced to 
0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1  hit 
point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you 
finish a long rest.
Savage Attacks.  W hen you score a critical hit with 
a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the w eapon’s 
damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra 
damage of the critical hit.
Languages.  You can speak, read, and 
write Com m on and Orc . Orc is a 
harsh, grating language with 
hard consonants. It has 
no script of its own 
but is written in the 
Dwarvish script.

“ Bu t y o u  d o s e e t h e  w a y  p e o p l e  l o o k  a t y o u , 
devil’ s child."
Those black eyes, cold as a winter storm, were staring  
right into her heart and the sudden seriousness in his  
voice jolted her.
“What is it they say?" he asked.  “One’s a curiosity, two’ s  
a conspiracy—”
“Three's a curse,” she finished. “You think I haven’t heard  
that rubbish before?”
“I  know y o u  have.” When she glared at him, he added,  
“It’ s not as if I’m plumbing the depths of your mind, dear  
girl. That is the burden of every tiefling. Some break under  
it, some make it the millstone around their neck, some  
revel in it.” He tilted his head again, scrutinizing her, withthat wicked glint in his eyes. “You fight it, don’t you? Like  
a little wildcat, I wager. Every little jab and comment just  
sharpens your claws.”
—Erin M . Evans, Brimstone Angels
To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer 
violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and 
fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to 
twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a 
pact struck generations ago infused the essence of 
A sm odeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their 
bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not 
their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which 
they and their children and their children’s children 
will always be held accountable.
In f e r n a l  Bl o o d l i n e
Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the 
broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, 
their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their 
appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any 
of a variety of shapes: som e have curling horns like a 
ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, 
and som e spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They 
have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil 
around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their 
canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are 
solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no 
visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full 
range of human coloration, but also include various 
shades of red. Their hair, cascading dow n from  behind 
their horns, is usually dark, from  black or brown to dark 
red, blue, or purple.
Se l f - R e l i a n t  a n d  Su s p i c i o u s
Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in 
human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters 
of those places, where they grow  up to be swindlers,

thieves, or crim e lords. Som etim es they live am ong 
other minority populations in enclaves where they are 
treated with m ore respect.
Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have 
to make their own way in the w orld and that they have 
to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust 
anyone w ho claim s to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s 
com panions demonstrate that they trust him or her, 
the tiefling learns to extend the sam e trust to them. 
And once a tiefling gives som eone loyalty, the tiefling 
is a firm friend or ally for life.
Ti e f l i n g  N a m e s  
Tiefling nam es fall into three broad categories. Tieflings 
born into another culture typically have nam es reflective 
of that culture. S om e have nam es derived from  the 
Infernal language, passed down through generations, 
that reflect their fiendish heritage. And som e younger 
tieflings, striving to find a place in the world, adopt a 
name that signifies a virtue or other concept and then 
try to em body that concept. For som e, the chosen name 
is a noble quest. For others, it’s a grim destiny.
Male Infernal Names: Akm enos, Am non, Barakas, 
Dam akos, Ekemon, Iados, Kairon, Leucis, Melech, 
Mordai, M orthos, Pelaios, Skam os, Therai 
Female Infernal Names: Akta, Anakis, Bryseis, Criella, 
Damaia, Ea, Kallista, Lerissa, Makaria, Nemeia, 
Orianna, Phelaia, Rieta 
“Virtue” Names: Art, Carrion, Chant, Creed, Despair, 
Excellence, Fear, Glory, Hope, Ideal, Music, Nowhere, 
Open, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Sorrow, 
Temerity, Torment, W earyMu t u a l  M is t r u s t
People tend to be suspicious of tieflings, assuming that 
their infernal heritage has left its mark on their personality 
and morality, not just their appearance. Shopkeepers keep 
a close eye on their goods when tieflings enter their stores, 
the town watch might follow a tiefling around for a while, 
and demagogues blame tieflings for strange happenings.
The reality, though, is that a  tiefling’s bloodline doesn’t affect 
his or her personality to any great degree. Years of dealing 
with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they 
respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the 
wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are simply 
very aware of how people respond to them. After dealing with 
this mistrust throughout youth, a tiefling often develops the 
ability to overcome prejudice through charm or intimidation.
Ti e f l i n g  Tr a i t s
Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their 
infernal descent.
Ability Score Increase.  Your Intelligence score 
increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.
Age.  Tieflings mature at the sam e rate as humans but 
live a few years longer.
Alignment.  Tieflings might not have an innate 
tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there. 
Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many 
tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.
Size.  Tieflings are about the sam e size and build as 
humans. Your size is Medium.
Speed.  Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Darkvision.  Thanks to your infernal heritage, you 
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You 
can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it w ere dim light. You 
can’t discern color in darkness, only shades o f gray.
Hellish Resistance.  You have resistance 
to fire damage.
Infernal Legacy.  You know  the thaumaturgy  cantrip. 
Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the hellish  
rebuke  spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell. O nce you 
reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness  spell 
once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for 
these spells.
Languages.  You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and Infernal.

Ch apter  3: C lasses
  A DVENTURERS ARE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE,
 driven by a thirst for excitement into a 
 life that others w ould never dare lead.
 They are heroes, com pelled to explore the 
 dark places of the world and take on the
challenges that lesser w om en and men 
can’t stand against.
Class is the primary definition of what your character 
can do. It’s m ore than a profession; it’s your character’s 
calling. Class shapes the way you think about the 
world and interact with it and your relationship with 
other people and pow ers in the multiverse. A fighter, 
for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms 
of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a 
pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might 
see him self as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan 
or a conflict brewing am ong various deities. W hile the 
fighter has contacts in a m ercenary com pany or army, 
the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and 
devotees w ho share his faith.Your class gives you a variety of special features, such 
as a fighter’s mastery of w eapons and armor, and a 
w izard’s spells. At low levels, your class gives you only 
two or three features, but as you advance in level you 
gain m ore and your existing features often improve. 
Each class entry in this chapter includes a table 
summ arizing the benefits you gain at every level, and 
a detailed explanation of each one.
Adventurers som etim es advance in m ore than one 
class. A rogue might switch direction in life and swear 
the oath of a paladin. A  barbarian might discover latent 
magical ability and dabble in the sorcerer class while 
continuing to advance as a barbarian. Elves are known 
to com bine martial mastery with m agical training 
and advance as fighters and w izards simultaneously. 
Optional rules for com bining classes in this way, called 
multiclassing, appear in chapter 6.
Twelve classes—listed in the Classes table—are found 
in almost every D&D world and define the spectrum  of 
typical adventurers.

A  tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, 
draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he 
charges toward the frost giant w ho dared poach his 
people’s elk herd.
A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her 
authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck 
with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.
Frothing at the mouth, a dw arf slam s his helmet into 
the face of his drow  foe, then turns to drive his armored 
elbow  into the gut o f another.
These barbarians, different as they might be, are 
defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and 
unthinking fury. M ore than a mere emotion, their anger 
is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting 
assault of a storm, the churning turmoil o f the sea.
For som e, their rage springs from  a com m union 
with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling 
reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every 
barbarian, rage is a pow er that fuels not just a battle 
frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and 
feats of strength.
Pr i m a l  In s t i n c t  
People of towns and cities take pride in how  their 
civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if 
denying one’s ow n nature w as a mark o f superiority. To 
a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign 
of w eakness. The strong em brace their animal n atu re- 
keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. 
Barbarians are uncom fortable when hedged in by walls 
and crow ds. They thrive in the w ilds o f their homelands: 
the tundra, jungle, or grasslands w here their tribes 
live and hunt.
Barbarians com e alive in the chaos of combat.
They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, 
giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A 
barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few 
times without resting, but those few rages are usually 
sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.
A  L i f e  o f D a n g e r  
Not every m em ber of the tribes deem ed “barbarians” 
by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A 
true barbarian am ong these people is as uncom m on as 
a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar 
role as a protector of the people and a leader in times 
of war. Life in the wild places of the w orld is fraught 
with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying

monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger 
so that their people don’t have to.
Their courage in the face of danger m akes barbarians 
perfectly suited for adventuring. W andering is often a 
way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of 
the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Som e 
barbarians m iss the close-knit family structures of the 
tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds 
formed am ong the m em bers of their adventuring parties.
Cr e a t i n g  a Ba r b a r i a n  
W hen creating a barbarian character, think about where 
your character com es from  and his or her place in the 
world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin 
for your barbarian. Did you com e from  a distant land, 
m aking you a stranger in the area of the cam paign?
Or is the cam paign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier 
where barbarians are com m on?W hat led you to take up the adventuring life? W ere you 
lured to settled lands by the prom ise of riches? Did you 
join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared 
threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you 
out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? 
Perhaps you w ere a prisoner of war, brought in chains to 
“civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom. 
Or you might have been cast out from  your people 
because of a crim e you committed, a taboo you violated, 
or a coup that removed you from  a position of authority.
Qu i c k  Bu i l d
You can make a barbarian quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in 
Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the 
outlander background.

Yo u s t a r t  w it h  t h e  f o l lo w in g  e q u ip m e n t, in  a d d itio n  to 
th e  e q u ip m e n t  g r a n t e d  b y  y o u r  b a c k g r o u n d :
•  (a) a greataxe or ( b) any martial melee weapon
•  (a) two handaxes or ( b) any simple weapon 
•  An explorer’s pack and four javelins
Ra g e  
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, 
you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
W hile raging, you gain the following benefits if you 
aren’t w earing heavy armor:
•  You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength 
saving throws.
•  W hen you make a melee weapon attack using 
Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that 
increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown 
in the Rage Damage colum n of the Barbarian table.
•  You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and 
slashing damage.
If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or 
concentrate on them while raging.
Your rage lasts for 1  minute. It ends early if you are 
knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you 
haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn 
or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage 
on your turn as a bonus action.
Once you have raged the number of tim es shown 
for your barbarian level in the Rages colum n of the 
Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you 
can rage again.Un a r m o r e d  D e f e n s e
W hile you are not wearing any armor, your Arm or Class 
equals 10 + your Dexterity m odifier + your Constitution 
modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
Re c k l e s s  A t t a c k
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern 
for defense to attack with fierce desperation. W hen 
you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide 
to attack recklessly. D oing so gives you advantage on 
m elee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this 
turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until 
your next turn.
Da n g e r  Se n s e
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things 
nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge 
when you dodge away from danger.
You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws 
against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. 
To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or 
incapacitated.
Pr i m a l  Pa t h
At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of 
your rage. C hoose the Path of the Berserker or the Path 
of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the 
class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd 
level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that 
it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you 
choose to end it.
In d o m i t a b l e  M i g h t  
Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength 
check is less than your Strength score, you can use that 
score in place of the total.
Pr i m a l  C h a m p i o n  
At 20th level, you em body the pow er of the wilds. Your 
Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your 
m axim um  for those scores is now  24.
Prim al  Paths
Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace 
that drives him or her toward greatness. DifferentAb i l i t y  Sc o r e  Im p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
Ex t r a  A t t a c k  
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
Fa s t  M o v e m e n t
Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet 
while you aren’t w earing heavy armor.
Fe r a l  In s t i n c t
By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have 
advantage on initiative rolls.
Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of 
com bat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally 
on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before 
doing anything else on that turn.
Br u t a l  C r i t i c a l  
Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional 
weapon damage die when determining the extra 
damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
This increases to two additional dice at 13th level 
and three additional dice at 17th level.
Re l e n t l e s s  R a g e  
Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting 
despite grievous w ounds. If you drop to 0 hit points 
while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make 
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you 
drop to 1 hit point instead.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC 
increases by 5. W hen you finish a short or long rest, the 
DC resets to 10.barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, 
however. For som e, it is an internal reservoir where 
pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as 
steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of 
a totem animal.
Pa t h  o f t h e  B e r s e r k e r
For som e barbarians, rage is a means to an end-— that 
end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path 
of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter 
the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, 
heedless of your own health or well-being.
Fr e n z y
Starting w hen you choose this path at 3rd level, you 
can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for 
the duration of your rage you can make a single melee 
w eapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns 
after this one. W hen your rage ends, you suffer one level 
o f exhaustion (as described in appendix A).
Min d l e s s  Ra g e
Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charm ed or 
frightened while raging. If you are charm ed or 
frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is 
suspended for the duration of the rage.
In t i m i d a t i n g  Pr e s e n c e
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to 
frighten som eone with your menacing presence.
W hen you do so, choose one creature that you can see 
within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear 
you, it must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw (DC 
equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma 
modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your 
next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action 
to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened
Pe r s i s t e n t  R a g e

creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends 
if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or m ore 
than 60 feet away from  you.
If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't 
use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
Re t a l ia t io n
Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from 
a creature that is within 5 feet of you. you can use 
your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against 
that creature.
Pa t h  o f t h e  T o t e m  W a r r i o r
The Path of the Totem W arrior is a spiritual journey, as 
the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, 
and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you 
with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your 
barbarian rage.
Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be 
kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for 
an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, 
though exceptions exist.
Sp ir it  Se e k e r
Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural 
world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when 
you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast  
sense  and speak with animals  spells, but only as rituals, 
as described in chapter 10.
To t e m  Sp ir it
At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a 
totem spirit and gain its feature. You must m ake or 
acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar 
adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, 
teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you 
also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent 
of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear 
totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick- 
skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn 
bright yellow.Your totem animal might be an animal related to those 
listed here but m ore appropriate to your homeland.
For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in 
place o f an eagle.
Bear.  W hile raging, you have resistance to all damage 
except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear m akes you 
tough enough to stand up to any punishment.
Eagle.  W hile you're raging and aren’t wearing 
heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on 
opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the 
Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit 
of the eagle m akes you into a predator w ho can weave 
through the fray with ease.
Wolf,  W hile you're raging, your friends have 
advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature 
within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of 
the w olf m akes you a leader of hunters.
As p e c t  o f t h e  Be a s t
At 6th level, you gain a m agical benefit based on the 
totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same 
animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.
Bear.  You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying 
capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) 
is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks 
made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.
Eagle.  You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can 
see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern 
even fine details as though looking at som ething no 
m ore than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim 
light doesn't im pose disadvantage on your W isdom  
(Perception) checks.
Wolf,  You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You 
can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, 
and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal 
pace (see chapter 8 for rules on travel pace).
Sp ir it  Wa l k e r
At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature  
spell, but only as a ritual. W hen you do so, a spiritual 
version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit 
or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the 
information you seek.
To t e m ic  At t u n e m e n t
At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a 
totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same 
animal you selected previously or a different one.
Bear,  W hile you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet 
o f you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack 
rolls against targets other than you or another character 
with this feature. An enemy is im mune to this effect if it 
can’t see or hear you or if it can’t be frightened.
Eagle.  W hile raging, you have a flying speed equal to 
your current walking speed. This benefit works only in 
short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and 
nothing else is holding you aloft.
Wolf.  W hile you’re raging, you can use a bonus action 
on your turn to knock a Large or sm aller creature prone 
w hen you hit it with m elee weapon attack.

In the worlds of D&D, w ords and music are 
not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with 
pow er all their own. The bard is a master of song, 
speech, and the m agic they contain. Bards say 
that the multiverse w as spoken into existence, that the 
w ords o f the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these 
primordial W ords o f Creation still resound throughout 
the cosm os. The m usic of bards is an attempt to snatch 
and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their 
spells and powers.
The greatest strength of bards is their sheer 
versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines 
in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and 
hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable 
of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using 
their m agic to bolster their sw ords and armor. Their 
spells lean toward charm s and illusions rather than 
blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging 
knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude 
that lets them do alm ost anything well. Bards becom e 
masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, 
from  musical perform ance to esoteric knowledge.
Le a r n i n g  f r o m  E x p e r i e n c e
True bards are not com m on in the world. Not every 
minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal 
court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music 
requires hard study and som e measure of natural talent 
that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard 
to spot the difference between these perform ers and true 
bards, though. A bard’s life is spent wandering across 
the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the 
gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. 
But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a 
touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.
Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and 
their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, 
new  skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the 
horizon—m akes an adventuring career a natural calling. 
Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a 
variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lostBard
Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient 
monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged 
leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, 
conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge 
of the people w ho constructed the monument and the 
mythic saga it depicts.
A stern human warrior bangs his sw ord rhythmically 
against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant 
and exhorting his com panions to bravery and heroism. 
The m agic of his song fortifies and em boldens them.
Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnom e w eaves

W hether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves 
m agic through w ords and m usic to inspire allies, 
dem oralize foes, manipulate minds, create 
illusions, and even heal wounds.

w orks of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange 
places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to 
accom pany heroes to w itness their deeds firsthand. A 
bard w ho can tell an awe-inspiring story from  personal 
experience earns renown am ong other bards. Indeed, 
after telling so many stories about heroes accom plishing 
mighty deeds, many bards take these them es to heart 
and assum e heroic roles themselves.Pr o f ic ie n c ie s

Cr e a t i n g  a Ba r d
Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true 
or not. Your character’s background and motivations 
are not as important as the stories that he or she tells 
about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane 
childhood. There’s no good story to be told about that, 
so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag 
in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy 
of a story. S om e bards acquire their magical music 
through extraordinary means, including the inspiration 
of fey or other supernatural creatures.
Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a 
master, following the m ore experienced bard until you 
were ready to strike out on your ow n? Or did you attend 
a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced 
your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway 
or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard w ho becam e 
your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble 
child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the 
clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in 
addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?Eq u ip m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to 
the equipment granted by your background:
•  (a) a rapier, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon
•  (a) a diplomat’s pack or ( b) an entertainer's pack
•  (a) a lute or ( b) any other musical instrument
•  Leather arm or and a dagger

You can make a bard quickly by 
following these suggestions. First,
Charisma should be your highest 
ability score, follow ed by Dexterity.
Second, choose the entertainer 
background. Third, choose the dancing lights  and 
vicious mockery  cantrips, along with the following 
1st-level spells: charm person, detect magic, healing  
word,  and thunderwave.

Sp e l l  Sl o t s
The Bard table show s how  many spell slots you have to 
cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of 
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level 
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know  the 1st-level spell cure 
wounds  and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot 
available, you can cast cure wounds  using either slot.
Spe lls  K n o w n  o f 1st Le v e l  a n d  H ig h e r
You know  four 1st-level spells of your choice from the 
bard spell list.
The Spells Known colum n of the Bard table shows 
when you learn m ore bard spells of your choice. Each of 
these spells must be of a level for which you have spell 
slots, as show n on the table. For instance, when you 
reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell 
o f 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you 
can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace 
it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Sp e l l c a s t in g  Ab i l it y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard 
spells. Your m agic com es from  the heart and soul you 
pour into the perform ance of your music or oration.
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your 
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charismamodifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard 
spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Ri t u a l  Ca s t i n g
You can cast any bard spell you know  as a ritual if that 
spell has the ritual tag.
Sp e l l c a s t in g  Fo c u s
You can use a m usical instrument (found in chapter 5) 
as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.
Ba r d i c  In s p i r a t i o n
You can inspire others through stirring w ords or music. 
To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose 
one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you 
w ho can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic 
Inspiration die, a d6.
Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll 
the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, 
attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can 
wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the 
Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM 
says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic 
Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A  creature can have 
only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.Th e Ba r d

an action, you can start a perform ance that lasts until 
the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any 
friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage 
on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. 
The perform ance ends early if you are incapacitated or 
silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).Ma g i c a l  Se c r e t s
By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge 
from  a w ide spectrum  of disciplines. C hoose two spells

table, or a cantrip.
The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are 
included in the number in the Spells K now n colum n of 
the Bard table.
You learn two additional spells from  any class at 14th 
level and again at 18th level.
Su p e r i o r  In s p i r a t i o n
At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses 
of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.
Bard  Colleges
The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each 
other out to swap songs and stories, boast o f their 
accom plishm ents, and share their knowledge. Bards 
form  loose associations, which they call colleges, to 
facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.
Co l l e g e  o f L o r e  
Bards of the College o f Lore know  som ething about 
m ost things, collecting bits of knowledge from  sources 
as diverse as scholarly tom es and peasant tales. 
W hether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate 
com positions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts 
to hold audiences spellbound. W hen the applause dies 
down, the audience m em bers might find themselves 
questioning everything they held to be true, from  their 
faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their 
loyalty to the king.
The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty 
and truth, not in fealty to a m onarch or following the 
tenets of a deity. A  noble w ho keeps such a bard as a 
herald or advisor knows that the bard w ould rather be 
honest than politic.
The college’s m em bers gather in libraries and 
som etim es in actual colleges, com plete with classroom s 
and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. 
They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they 
can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self- 
important figures of authority.
Bo n u s  Pr o f ic ie n c ie s
W hen you join  the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain 
proficiency with three skills o f your choice.
Cu t t i n g  Wo r d s
A lso at 3rd level, you learn how  to use your wit to 
distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and 
com petence of others. W hen a creature that you can 
see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability 
check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to 
expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling 
a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number 
rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use 
this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before 
the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability

check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its 
damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if 
it’s immune to being charmed.
Ad d i t io n a l  M a g i c a l  Se c r e t s
At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from  any 
class. A  spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, 
as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen 
spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count 
against the number of bard spells you know.
Pe e r l e ss  Sk il l
Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, 
you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a 
Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to 
your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roil 
the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you 
whether you succeed or fail.
Co l l e g e  o f Va l o r
Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds w hose 
tales keep alive the m em ory of the great heroes of the 
past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. 
These bards gather in mead halls or around great 
bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past 
and present. They travel the land to w itness great 
events firsthand and to ensure that the m em ory of 
those events doesn’t pass from  the world. With theirsongs, they inspire others to reach the sam e heights of 
accom plishm ent as the heroes of old.
Bo n u s  Pr o f ic ie n c ie s
W hen you join  the College of Valor at 3rd level, you 
gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and 
martial weapons.
Co m b a t  In s p ir a t io n
Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle.
A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from  you 
can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon 
damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack 
roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction 
to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number 
rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll 
but before knowing whether it hits or m isses.
Ex t r a  At t a c k
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
Ba t t l e  M a g ic
At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving 
spellcasting and weapon use into a single harm onious 
act. W hen you use your action to cast a bard spell, you 
can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

Arm s and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer 
on his lips, an elf begins to glow  with an inner light that 
spills out to heal his battle-worn com panions.

Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world 
and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods 
they serve, clerics strive to em body the handiwork of 
their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with 
divine magic.
He a l e r s  a n d  W a r r i o r s
Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the pow er of 
the gods, flowing from  them into the world. Clerics are 
conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous 
effects. The gods don’t grant this pow er to everyone w ho  
seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.
H arnessing divine m agic doesn’t rely on study or 
training. A  cleric might learn formulaic prayers and 
ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on 
devotion and an intuitive sense o f a deity’s wishes.
Clerics com bine the helpful magic o f healing and 
inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder 
foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of 
plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven 
to consum e their enemies. For those evildoers w ho will 
benefit most from a m ace to the head, clerics depend on 
their com bat training to let them wade into melee with 
the pow er of the gods on their side.
Di v i n e  A g e n t s
Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a 
cleric. Som e priests are called to a simple life o f temple 
service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and 
sacrifice, not by m agic and strength o f arms. In som e 
cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed 
as a stepping stone to higher positions o f authority and 
involving no com m union with a god at all. True clerics 
are rare in most hierarchies.
W hen a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually 
because his or her god dem ands it. Pursuing the goals 
of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the 
walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in 
ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect

their deities’ w orshipers, which can mean fighting 
rampaging orc s, negotiating peace between warring 
nations, or sealing a portal that w ould allow a demon 
prince to enter the world.
M ost adventuring clerics maintain som e connection to 
established temples and orders of their faiths. A  temple 
might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a 
position to dem and it.
Cr e a t i n g  a C l e r i c
As you create a cleric, the m ost important question to 
consider is w hich deity to serve and what principles you 
want your character to embody. Appendix B includes 
lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. Check with 
your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.
O nce you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric's 
relationship to that god. Did you enter this service 
willingly? Or did the god choose you, im pelling you into 
service with no regard for your w ishes? H ow  do the 
temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion 
or a troublemaker? W hat are your ultimate goals? D oes 
your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are 
you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?

You can make a cleric quickly by follow ing these 
suggestions. First, W isdom  should be your highest

Sp e l l c a s t i n g
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. 
S ee chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and 
chapter 11 for the cleric spell list.
Ca n t r i p s
At 1st level, you know three cantrips o f your choice from 
the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips 
of your choice at higher levels, as show n in the Cantrips 
Known colum n of the Cleric table.
Pr e p a r i n g  a n d  Ca s t i n g  Sp e l l s
The Cleric table show s how  many spell slots you have 
to cast your spells o f 1st level and higher. To cast one of 
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level 
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available 
for you to cast, choosing from  the cleric spell list. W hen 
you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to 
your W isdom  modifier + your cleric level (minimum of 
one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a W isdom  
of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells 
of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare 
the 1st-level spell cure wounds,  you can cast it using 
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t 
remove it from  your list of prepared spells.You can change your list of prepared spells w hen you 
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list o f cleric spells 
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Ab i l i t y
W isdom  is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. 
The pow er of your spells com es from  your devotion to 
your deity. You use your W isdom  whenever a cleric spell 
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use 
your W isdom  m odifier when setting the saving throw 
DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an 
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
Ri t u a l  Ca s t i n g
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the 
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Fo c u s
You can use a holy sym bol (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.
Di v i n e  D o m a i n
C hoose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, 
Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each 
dom ain is detailed at the end of the class description, 
and each one provides exam ples of gods associated 
with it. Your choice grants you dom ain spells and other 
features when you ch oose it at 1st level. It also grants 
you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you 
gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 
6th, 8th, and 17th levels.
Do m a i n  Sp e l l s
Each dom ain has a list of spells—its dom ain spells— 
that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain 
description. Once you gain a dom ain spell, you always 
have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the 
number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you have a dom ain spell that doesn’t appear on the 
cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
Ch a n n e l  D i v i n i t y
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine 
energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel 
magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn 
Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Som e 
dom ains grant you additional effects as you advance in 
levels, as noted in the dom ain description.
W hen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose 
which effect to create. You must then finish a short or 
long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
S om e Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. 
W hen you use such an effect from  this class, the DC 
equals your cleric spell save DC.
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel 
Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level.

you can use it three times between rests. W hen you finish 
a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
Ch a n n e l  Di v i n i t y : Tu r n  Un d e a d  
As an action, you present your holy sym bol and speak a 
prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see 
or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a W isdom  
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is 
turned for 1  minute or until it takes any damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move 
as far away from  you as it can, and it can’t willingly 
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take 
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action 
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from 
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use 
the D odge action.
Ab i l i t y  Sc o r e  Im p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
De s t r o y  U n d e a d
Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving 
throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is 
instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a 
certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

Di v i n e  In t e r v e n t i o n
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to 
intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your 
action. D escribe the assistance you seek, and roll 
percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower 
than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM 
chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any 
cleric spell or cleric dom ain spell w ould be appropriate.
If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature 
again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after 
you finish a long rest.
At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds 
automatically, no roll required.
Divine  Dom ains
In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different 
aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s 
domain. All the dom ains over w hich a deity has 
influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, 
the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes thedom ains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you 
choose one aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, 
and you are granted pow ers related to that domain.
Your choice might correspond to a particular sect 
dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be 
worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, 
emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, 
and in a different place as A pollo Acesius (“healing”), 
emphasizing his association with the Life domain. 
Alternatively, your choice of dom ain could simply be a 
matter of personal preference, the aspect o f the deity 
that appeals to you most.
Each dom ain’s description gives examples of deities 
w ho have influence over that domain. G ods are included 
from  the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, 
Dragonlance, and Eberron cam paign settings, as well as 
from  the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons 
o f antiquity.
Kn o w l e d g e  D o m a i n

W isdom  saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the 
saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again until 
you finish a long rest.
If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface 
thoughts (those forem ost in its mind, reflecting its 
current em otions and what it is actively thinking 
about) w hen it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts 
for 1  minute.
During that time, you can use your action to end this

one significant event, beginning with the m ost recent. 
Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, 
such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders,

G ods of nature are as varied as the natural world 
itself, from  inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such 
as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to 
friendly deities associated with particular springs and 
groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a 
whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing 
mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in 
their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have 
clerics as well, cham pions who take a m ore active role 
in advancing the interests o f a particular nature god. 
These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that 
despoil the w oodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, 
or wither the crops of those w ho anger their gods.

you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, 
given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

range of 120 feet.
Wa r D o m a i n  
War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of 
ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with 
acts o f cruelty and cow ardice eclipsing instances of 
excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of warwatch over w arriors and reward them for their great 
deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring 
others to fight the good fight or offering acts o f violence 
as prayers. G ods of war include cham pions of honor 
and chivalry (such as Torm, H eironeous, and Kiri- 
Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such 
as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of 
conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and 
Maglubiyet). Other w ar gods (such as Tempus, Nike, 
and Nuada) take a m ore neutral stance, prom oting war 
in all its manifestations and supporting w arriors in any 
circum stance.

Druid
Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf 
sum m ons the fury of the storm and calls dow n explosive 
bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orc s who 
threaten her forest.
Crouching out o f sight on a high tree branch in the 
form  of a leopard, a human peers out o f the jungle at the 
strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, 
keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities.
Swinging a blade form ed of pure fire, a half-elf 
charges into a m ass o f skeletal soldiers, sundering 
the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the 
m ocking sem blance o f life.
W hether calling on the elemental forces of nature or 
emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are 
an em bodim ent of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury. 
They claim  no mastery over nature. Instead, they see 
themselves as extensions o f nature’s indomitable will.
Po w e r  o f N a t u r e
Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and 
other m agical pow ers either from  the force of nature 
itself or from  a nature deity. Many druids pursue a 
mystic spirituality o f transcendent union with nature 
rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others 
serve gods o f wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. 
The ancient druidic traditions are som etim es called 
the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship o f gods in 
temples and shrines.
Druid spells are oriented toward nature and anim als— 
the pow er of tooth and claw, of sun and m oon, of fire 
and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal 
forms, and som e druids make a particular study of this 
practice, even to the point w here they prefer animal 
form  to their natural form.
Pr e s e r v e  t h e  B a l a n c e
For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The 
four elements that make up a w orld—air, earth, fire,

and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element 
w ere to gain pow er over the others, the world could be 
destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and 
broken apart into its com ponent elements. Thus, druids 
oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others w ho promote 
one element to the exclusion of others.
Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological 
balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need 
for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in 
opposition to it. Druids accept that w hich is cruel in 
nature, and they hate that w hich is unnatural, including 
aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) 
and undead (such as zom bies and vampires). Druids 
som etim es lead raids against such creatures, especially 
when the monsters encroach on the druids’ territory.
Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or 
watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a 
significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance 
or the lands they protect, druids take on a m ore active 
role in com bating the threat, as adventurers.
Cr e a t i n g  a  Dr u i d  
W hen making a druid, consider why your character has 
such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character 
lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was 
raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths 
o f a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic 
encounter with the spirits of nature, com ing face to 
face with a giant eagle or dire w olf and surviving the 
experience. Maybe your character w as born during an 
epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpretedas a sign that becom ing a druid 
was part of your character’s destiny.
Have you always been an adventurer 
as part of your druidic calling, or did you 
first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred 
grove or spring? Perhaps your hom eland was 
befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in 
hopes of finding a new hom e or purpose.
Qu i c k  Bu i l d
You can make a druid quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, W isdom  should be your highest 
ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose 
the hermit background.

Eq u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to 
the equipment granted by your background:
•  (a) a w ooden shield or (b) any simple weapon 
•  (a) a scim itar or (b) any simple melee weapon
•  Leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus
Dr u i d i c
You know  Druidic, the secret language of druids. You 
can speak the language and use it to leave hidden 
m essages. You and others w ho know  this language 
automatically spot such a message. Others spot the 
m essage’s presence with a successful DC 15 W isdom  
(Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you 
can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See 
chapter 10 for the general rules o f spellcasting and 
chapter 11 for the druid spell list.
Ca n t r i p s
At 1st level, you know  two cantrips of your choice from 
the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips 
o f your choice at higher levels, as show n in the Cantrips 
K now n colum n of the Druid table.
Pr e p a r i n g  a n d  Ca s t i n g  Sp e l l s
The Druid table show s how  many spell slots you have 
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of 
these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s 
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when 
you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list o f druid spells that are available 
for you to cast, choosing from  the druid spell list. W hen 
you do so, choose a number o f druid spells equal to 
your W isdom  m odifier + your druid level (minimum of
Sa c r e d  Pl a n t s  a n d  W o o d
A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, 
ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, 
willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a 
spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or 
sprigs of mistletoe.
Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, 
such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death 
and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might 
be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak 
with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole 
weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. 
Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown 
weapons, such as darts or javelins.
Druids from regions that lack the plants described here 
have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For 
instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca 
tree and cactus plants.one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a W isdom  
of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells 
of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare 
the 1st-level spell cure wounds,  you can cast it using 
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t 
remove it from  your list of prepared spells.
You can also change your list of prepared spells when 
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid 
spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at 
least 1  minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Ab i l i t y
W isdom  is your spellcasting ability for your druid 
spells, since your m agic draws upon your devotion and 
attunement to nature. You use your W isdom  whenever 
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, 
you use your W isdom  modifier when setting the saving 
throw DC for a druid spell you cast and w hen making an 
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
Ri t u a l  Ca s t i n g
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the 
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Fo c u s
You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
Wi l d  Sh a p e
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to 
m agically assum e the shape of a beast that you have 
seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain 
expended uses w hen you finish a short or long rest.
Your druid level determ ines the beasts you can 
transform into, as show n in the Beast Shapes table. At 
2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast 
that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t 
have a flying or sw im m ing speed.
Be a s t  Sh a p e s
Level Max. CR Limitations Example
2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf
4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile
8th 1 — Giant eagle
You can stay in a beast shape for a number o f hours 
equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then 
revert to your norm al form  unless you expend another 
use of this feature. You can revert to your normal 
form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You 
automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 
0 hit points, or die.
W hile you are transformed, the following rules apply:

•  Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of 
the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, 
and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma scores. You 
also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficien- 
cies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If 
the creature has the same proficiency as you and the 
bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the 
creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has 
any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
•  W hen you transform, you assum e the beast’s hit 
points and Hit Dice. W hen you revert to your norm al 
form, you return to the number of hit points you had 
before you transformed. However, if you revert as a 
result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage 
carries over to your norm al form. For example, if you 
take 10 damage in animal form  and have only 1 hit 
point left, you revert and take 9 damage. A s long as 
the excess damage doesn’t reduce your norm al form  
to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
•  You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or 
take any action that requires hands is limited to the 
capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t 
break your concentration on a spell you’ve already 
cast, however, or prevent you from  taking actions that 
are part of a spell, such as call lightning,  that you’ve 
already cast.
•  You retain the benefit of any features from  your class, 
race, or other source and can use them if the new 
form  is physically capable of doing so. However, you 
can’t use any o f your special senses, such as darkvi- 
sion, unless your new form also has that sense.
•  You choose whether your equipment falls to the 
ground in your space, m erges into your new form, or 
is w orn by it. W orn equipment functions as normal, 
but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new 
form  to w ear a piece of equipment, based on the crea- 
ture’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change 
size or shape to match the new 
form, and any equipment that 
the new form  can’t w ear 
must either fall to the 
ground or merge with it.
Equipment that m erges 
with the form  has no 
effect until you leave 
the form.
Dr u i d  C i r c l e
At 2nd level, you choose to 
identify with a circle of druids: 
the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the M oon, both 
detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice 
grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, 
and 14th level.
Ab i l i t y  Sc o r e  Im p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of 
your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores 
of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an 
ability score above 20 using this feature.Starting at 18th level, the primal m agic that you wield 
causes you to age m ore slowly. For every 10 years that 
pass, your body ages only 1 year.
Be a s t  Sp e l l s
Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid 
spells in any shape you assum e using W ild Shape. You 
can perform  the som atic and verbal com ponents of a 
druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to 
provide material com ponents.
Ar c h d r u i d
At 20th level, you can use your W ild Shape an unlimited 
num ber of times.Ti m e l e s s  B o d y

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and som atic 
com ponents of your druid spells, as well as any material 
com ponents that lack a cost and aren’t consum ed by a 
spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape 
and your beast shape from W ild Shape.
Druid  Circles
Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, 
druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring 
political borders. All druids are nominally m em bers 
of this druidic society, though som e individuals are so 
isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking 
m em bers of the society or participated in druidic 
gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and 
sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids 
som etim es com pete with or even prey on each other.
At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that 
share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the 
way o f the druid.
Ci r c l e  o f t h e  L a n d
The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages 
w ho safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through 
a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred 
circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal 
secrets in Druidic. The circle’s w isest m em bers preside 
as the chief priests of com m unities that hold to the Old 
Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.
As a m em ber of this circle, your m agic is influenced 
by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s 
mysterious rites.
Bo n u s  Ca n t r i p
W hen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one 
additional druid cantrip of your choice.
Na t u r a l  Re c o v e r y
Starting at 2nd level, you can regain som e of your 
magical energy by sitting in meditation and com m uning 
with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended 
spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a 
com bined level that is equal to or less than half your 
druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 
6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until 
you finish a long rest 
For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can 
recover up to two levels w orth of spell slots. You can 
recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.
Ci r c l e  Sp e l l s
Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with 
the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 
9th level you gain access to circle spells connected 
to the land where you becam e a druid. C hoose that 
land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, 
swamp, or Underdark—and consult the associated 
list of spells.
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have 
it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of 
spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a 
spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell 
is nonetheless a druid spell for you.Ar c t i c

La n d ’s St r i d e
Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical 
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can 
also pass through nonm agical plants without being 
slowed by them and without taking damage from  them if 
they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against 
plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede 
movement, such those created by the entangle  spell.
Na t u r e ’s Wa r d
W hen you reach 10th level, you can’t be charm ed or 
frightened by elementals or fey, and you are im mune to 
poison and disease.
Na t u r e ’s Sa n c t u a r y
W hen you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural 
world sense your connection to nature and becom e 
hesitant to attack you. W hen a beast or plant creature 
attacks you, that creature must make a W isdom  saving 
throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, 
the creature must choose a different target, or the attack 
automatically m isses. On a successful save, the creature 
is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
The creature is aware of this effect before it m akes its 
attack against you.
Ci r c l e  o f t h e  M o o n
Druids of the Circle of the M oon are fierce guardians 
of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full m oon to 
share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest 
parts of the wilderness, where they might go for w eeks 
on end before crossing paths with another humanoid 
creature, let alone another druid.
Changeable as the m oon, a druid of this circle might 
prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops 
as an eagle the next day, and crash through the 
undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing 
monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.
Co m b a t  Wi l d Sh a p e
W hen you ch oose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the 
ability to use W ild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, 
rather than as an action.
Additionally, while you are transformed by W ild 
Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one 
spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell 
slot expended.
Ci r c l e  Fo r m s
The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform 
into m ore dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd 
level, you can use your W ild Shape to transform into a 
beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore 
the Max. CR colum n of the Beast Shapes table, but must 
abide by the other limitations there).
Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast 
with a challenge rating as high as your druid level 
divided by 3, rounded down.Pr i m a l  St r i k e
Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as 
m agical for the purpose of overcom ing resistance and 
immunity to nonm agical attacks and damage.
El e m e n t a l  Wi l d Sh a p e
At 10th level, you can expend two uses of W ild Shape 
at the sam e time to transform into an air elemental, an 
earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.
Th o u s a n d  Fo r m s
By 14th level, you have learned to use m agic to alter 
your physical form in m ore subtle ways. You can cast the 
alter self  spell at will.
Druids  a n d  th e  Gods
Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but 
most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities 
worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix 
B  include many such deities). The worship of these deities 
is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths 
of clerics and urbanized peoples. In  fact, in the world of 
Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it 
claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, 
and others who live closely with nature. This tradition 
includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond 
personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, 
the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, 
and Ulaa.
In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, 
druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a 
single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, 
for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus,
Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: 
Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are 
often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and 
most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy 
of veneration.
The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely 
unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of 
the other religions of the world. They believe that every living 
thing and every natural phenomenon— sun, moon, wind, 
fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are 
a means to communicate with and command these spirits. 
Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies 
about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other 
and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, 
believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, 
the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the 
Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the 
world from the incursion of aberrations.

Fighter
A human in clanging plate arm or holds her shield 
before her as she runs toward the m assed goblins. An 
elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers 
the goblins with arrows loosed from  his exquisite 
bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping 
the two combatants coordinate their assault to the 
best advantage.
A dw arf in chain mail interposes his shield between 
the ogre’s club and his com panion, knocking the deadly 
blow aside. His com panion, a half-elf in scale armor, 
swings tw o scim itars in a blinding whirl as she circles 
the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.
A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with 
his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving 
them around for the crow d’s delight—and his own 
tactical advantage. His opponent’s sw ord flares with 
blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing 
forth to smite him.
All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most 
diverse class of characters in the w orlds of Du n g e o n s  & 
Dr a g o n s . Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal 
champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, 
and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an 
unparalleled mastery with w eapons and armor, and a 
thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they 
are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and 
staring it defiantly in the face.
We l l - R o u n d e d  Sp e c i a l i s t s
Fighters learn the basics of all com bat styles. Every 
fighter can sw ing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a 
longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes 
in a net with som e degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is 
adept with shields and every form  of armor. Beyond that 
basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a 
certain style of combat. S om e concentrate on archery, 
som e on fighting with two w eapons at once, and som e 
on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This 
com bination of broad general ability and extensive 
specialization m akes fighters superior combatants 
on battlefields and in dungeons alike.
Tr a i n e d  f o r  D a n g e r  
Not every m em ber of the city watch, the village militia, 
or the queen’s army is a fighter. M ost of these troops are 
relatively untrained soldiers with only the m ost basic 
com bat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, 
trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar 
figures are fighters.

Som e fighters feel drawn to use their training as 
adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and 
other dangerous w ork com m on am ong adventurers is 
second nature for a fighter, not all that different from 
the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, 
perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in 
the city watch have the opportunity to discover a m agic 
flame tongue  sword, for example.
Cr e a t i n g  a Fi g h t e r
As you build your fighter, think about two related 
elements of your character's background: W here did 
you get your com bat training, and what set you apart 
from the mundane w arriors around you? W ere you 
particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from  a 
mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? 
W hat drove you to this training in the first place? A 
threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need 
to prove yourself might all have been factors.
You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s 
army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war 
academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. 
Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. 
Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits 
o f life on a farm, or are you following a proud family 
tradition? W here did you acquire your w eapons and 
armor? They might have been military issue or family 
heirloom s, or perhaps you scrim ped and saved for yearsto buy them. Your armaments are now  am ong your 
m ost important possession s—the only things that stand 
betw een you and death’s embrace.
Qu i c k  Bu i l d
You can make a fighter quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your 
highest ability score, depending on whether you 
want to focus on melee w eapons or on archery (or 
finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be 
Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the 
Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose 
the soldier background.

Martial  Archetypes
Different fighters choose different approaches to 
perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype 
you choose to emulate reflects your approach.
Ch a m p i o n  
The archetypal Champion focuses on the development 
of raw physical pow er honed to deadly perfection.
Those who model themselves on this archetype combine 
rigorous training with physical excellence to deal 
devastating blows.
Im p r o v e d  Cr i t i c a l
Beginning when you ch oose this archetype at 3rd 
level, your w eapon attacks score a critical hit on a 
roll of 19 or 20.
Re m a r k a b l e  At h l e t e
Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency 
bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or 
Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use 
your proficiency bonus.
In addition, when you make a running long jump, the 
distance you can cover increases by a number of feet 
equal to your Strength modifier.

Ad d i t i o n a l  Fi g h t i n g  St y l e
At 10th level, you can choose a second option from  the
Fighting Style class feature.
Su r v i v o r
At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in 
battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit 
points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you 
have no m ore than half of your hit points left. You don’t 
gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
Ba t t l e  M a s t e r
T hose w ho emulate the archetypal Battle Master 
employ martial techniques passed down through 
generations. To a Battle Master, com bat is an academ ic 
field, som etim es including subjects beyond battle such 
as weaponsm ithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter 
absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry 
that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but 
those w ho do are well-rounded fighters of great skill 
and knowledge.
Co m b a t  Su p e r i o r i t y
W hen you ch oose this archetype at 3rd level, you 
learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called 
superiority dice.
Maneuvers.  You learn three maneuvers of your 
choice, which are detailed under “M aneuvers” below. 
Many m aneuvers enhance an attack in som e way. You 
can use only one maneuver per attack.
You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice 
at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new 
maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you 
know with a different one.
Superiority Dice.  You have four superiority dice, 
which are d8s. A  superiority die is expended when you 
use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice 
when you finish a short or long rest.
You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one 
m ore at 15th level.
Saving Throws.  S om e of your maneuvers require 
your target to make a saving throw to resist the 
maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated 
as follows:
Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
St u d e n t  o f Wa r
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of 
artisan’s tools of your choice.
Kn o w  Yo u r  En e m y
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute 
observing or interacting with another creature outside 
combat, you can learn certain information about its 
capabilities com pared to your own. The DM tells you if 
the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard 
to two of the following characteristics of your choice:Su p e r i o r  Cr i t i c a l
Starting at 15th level, your w eapon attacks score a 
critical hit on a roll of 18-20.

•  Strength score
•  Dexterity score
•  Constitution score
•  Arm or Class
•  Current hit points
•  Total class levels (if any)
•  Fighter class levels (if any)
Im p r o v e d  Co m b a t  Su p e r i o r i t y
At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At
18th level, they turn into d l2 s.
Re l e n t l e s s
Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and 
have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1  
superiority die.
Ma n e u v e r s
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.
Commander’s Strike.  W hen you take the Attack 
action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks 
and use a bonus action to direct one of your com panions 
to strike. W hen you do so, choose a friendly creature 
w ho can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. 
That creature can immediately use its reaction to make 
one w eapon attack, adding the superiority die to the 
attack’s damage roll.
Disarming Attack.  W hen you hit a creature with a 
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to 
attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item 
o f your choice that it’s holding. You add the superiority 
die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must 
make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops 
the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
Distracting Strike.  W hen you hit a creature with a 
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to 
distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You 
add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. The 
next attack roll against the target by an attacker other 
than you has advantage if the attack is made before the 
start of your next turn.
Evasive Footwork.  W hen you move, you can expend 
one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the 
number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.
Feinting Attack.  You can expend one superiority die 
and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing 
one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You 
have advantage on your next attack roll against that 
creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the 
attack’s damage roll.
Goading Attack.  W hen you hit a creature with a 
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to 
attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add 
the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and 
the target must make a W isdom  saving throw. On a 
failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack 
rolls against targets other than you until the end of 
your next turn.
Lunging Attack.  W hen you make a melee w eapon 
attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die 
to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, 
you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.Maneuvering Attack.  W hen you hit a creature with 
a w eapon attack, you can expend one superiority 
die to maneuver one o f your com rades into a more 
advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the 
attack’s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature 
who can see or hear you. That creature can use its 
reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking 
opportunity attacks from  the target of your attack.
Menacing Attack.  W hen you hit a creature with a 
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to 
attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority 
die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must 
make a W isdom  saving throw. On a failed save, it is 
frightened of you until the end o f your next turn.
Parry.  W hen another creature dam ages you with a 
melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one 
superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you 
roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.
Precision Attack.  W hen you make a weapon attack 
roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority 
die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver 
before or after making the attack roll, but before any 
effects of the attack are applied.
Pushing Attack.  W hen you hit a creature with 
a w eapon attack, you can expend one superiority 
die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the 
superiority die to the attack's dam age roll, and if the 
target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength 
saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up 
to 15 feet away from  you.
Rally.  On your turn, you can use a bonus action and 
expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one 
o f your com panions. W hen you do so, choose a friendly 
creature w ho can see or hear you. That creature gains 
temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + 
your Charisma modifier.
Riposte.  W hen a creature m isses you with a melee 
attack, you can use your reaction and expend one 
superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against 
the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the 
attack's damage roll.
Sweeping Attack.  W hen you hit a creature with a 
melee w eapon attack, you can expend one superiority 
die to attempt to dam age another creature with the 
sam e attack. C hoose another creature within 5 feet 
of the original target and within your reach. If the 
original attack roll w ould hit the second creature, it 
takes damage equal to the number you roll on your 
superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by 
the original attack.
Trip Attack.  W hen you hit a creature with a weapon 
attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt 
to knock the target down. You add the superiority die 
to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or 
smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a 
failed save, you knock the target prone.
El d r i t c h  K n i g h t
The archetypal Eldritch Knight com bines the martial 
mastery com m on to all fighters with a careful study of 
magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar 
to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study

on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and 
evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight 
additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal 
damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s 
reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively 
small number of spells, com m itting them to m em ory 
instead of keeping them in a spellbook.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g
W hen you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial 
prow ess with the ability to cast spells. S ee chapter 10 
for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for 
the w izard spell list.
Cantrips.  You learn two cantrips of your choice from 
the w izard spell list. You learn an additional w izard 
cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
Spell Slots.  The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table 
show s how  many spell slots you have to cast your 
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these 
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or 
higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield  and 
have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you 
can cast shield  using either slot.
Spells Known o f 1st-Level and Higher.  You know 
three 1st-level w izard spells of your choice, tw o of which 
you must ch oose from  the abjuration and evocation 
spells on the w izard spell list.
The Spells K now n colum n of the Eldritch Knight 
Spellcasting table show s when you learn m ore w izard 
spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be 
an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must 
be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, 
when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one 
new  spell o f 1st or 2nd level.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can 
com e from  any school of magic.
W henever you gain a level in this class, you can 
replace one of the w izard spells you know with another 
spell o f your choice from  the wizard spell list. The 
new spell must be of a level for w hich you have spell 
slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, 
unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, 
or 20th level.
Spellcasting Ability.  Intelligence is your spellcasting 
ability for your w izard spells, since you learn your 
spells through study and memorization. You use your 
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting 
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier 
when setting the saving throw DC for a w izard spell you 
cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier
We a p o n  Bo n d
At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical 
bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform  
the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be doneduring a short rest. The w eapon must be within your 
reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which 
you touch the weapon and forge the bond.
O nce you have bonded a w eapon to yourself, you 
can’t be disarm ed of that w eapon unless you are 
incapacitated. If it is on the sam e plane of existence, 
you can sum m on that weapon as a bonus action on your 
turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
You can have up to two bonded w eapons, but can 
sum m on only one at a time with your bonus action.
If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must 
break the bond with one of the other two.
Wa r M a g i c
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to 
cast a cantrip, you can make one w eapon attack as a 
bonus action.
El d r i t c h  St r i k e
At 10th level, you learn how  to m ake your weapon 
strikes undercut a creature’s resistance to your spells. 
W hen you hit a creature with a w eapon attack, that 
creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw 
it m akes against a spell you cast before the end of 
your next turn.
Ar c a n e  Ch a r g e
At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 
feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use 
your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the 
additional action.

Her fists a blur as they deflect an incom ing hail of arrows, 
a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself 
into the m assed ranks o f hobgoblins on the other side. 
She whirls am ong them, knocking their blow s aside and 
sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.
Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos 
settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orc s 
reach him, he exhales and a blast o f fire roars from  his 
mouth, engulfing his foes.
M oving with the silence of the night, a black-clad 
halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and 
em erges from  another inky shadow  on a balcony a 
stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free o f its cloth- 
wrapped scabbard and peers through the open w indow  
at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip o f sleep.
W hatever their discipline, m onks are united in their 
ability to magically harness the energy that flows in 
their bodies. W hether channeled as a striking display 
of com bat prow ess or a subtler focus o f defensive ability 
and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.
Th e M a g i c  o f K i
M onks make careful study o f a magical energy that most 
monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element 
o f the m agic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, 
the element that flows through living bodies. M onks 
harness this pow er within themselves to create magical 
effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, 
and som e of their special attacks can hinder the flow o f 
ki in their opponents. Using this energy, m onks channel 
uncanny speed and strength into their unarm ed strikes. 
As they gain experience, their martial training and their 
mastery o f ki gives them m ore pow er over their bodies 
and the bodies of their foes.

there seek personal perfection through contemplation 
and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery 
as children, sent to live there when their parents died, 
when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in 
return for som e kindness that the m onks had perform ed 
for their families.
S om e m onks live entirely apart from  the surrounding 
population, secluded from  anything that might im pede 
their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation,

em erging only to serve as spies or assassins at the 
com m and of their leader, a noble patron, or som e other 
mortal or divine power.
The majority o f m onks don’t shun their neighbors, 
making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and 
exchanging their service for food and other goods. As 
versatile warriors, m onks often end up protecting their 
neighbors from  m onsters or tyrants.
For a monk, becom ing an adventurer m eans leaving 
a structured, com m unal lifestyle to becom e a wanderer. 
This can be a harsh transition, and m onks don’t 
undertake it lightly. T hose w ho leave their cloisters take 
their w ork seriously, approaching their adventures as 
personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth.
As a rule, m onks care little for material wealth and are 
driven by a desire to accom plish a greater m ission than 
merely slaying m onsters and plundering their treasure.
C REATING A M O N K
As you make your monk character, think about your 
connection to the monastery where you learned your 
skills and spent your formative years. W ere you an 
orphan or a child left on the m onastery’s threshold? Did 
your parents prom ise you to the m onastery in gratitude 
for a service perform ed by the m onks? Did you enter 
this secluded life to hide from a crim e you com m itted? 
Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?
Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery 
choose you for a particularly important mission beyond 
the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of 
som e violation of the com m unity’s rules. Did you dread 
leaving, or w ere you happy to go? Is there som ething 
you hope to accom plish outside the monastery? Are you 
eager to return to your  hom e?A s a result of the structured life o f a m onastic 
com m unity and the discipline required to harness ki, 
m onks are almost always lawful in alignment.

Un a r m o r e d  D e f e n s e
Beginning at 1st level, while you are w earing no armor 
and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your 
Dexterity m odifier + your W isdom  modifier.
Ma r t i a l  A r t s
At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you 
mastery of com bat styles that use unarm ed strikes and 
m onk w eapons, which are shortsw ords and any simple 
melee w eapons that don’t have the two-handed or 
heavy property.
You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed 
or wielding only m onk w eapons and you aren’t wearing 
arm or or wielding a shield:
•  You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the 
attack and damage rolls o f your unarm ed strikes and 
m onk weapons.
•  You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage 
o f your unarm ed strike or m onk weapon. This die 
changes as you gain m onk levels, as shown in the 
Martial Arts colum n of the M onk table.
•  W hen you use the Attack action with an unarmed 
strike or a m onk w eapon on your turn, you can make 
one unarm ed strike as a bonus action. For example, if 
you take the Attack action and attack with a quarter- 
staff, you can also make an unarm ed strike as a bonus 
action, assum ing you haven't already taken a bonus 
action this turn.
Certain m onasteries use specialized form s of the 
m onk weapons. For example, you might use a club 
that is two lengths of w ood  connected by a short chain 
(called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter 
blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a 
m onk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided 
for the weapon in chapter 5.
K i 
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to 
harness the mystic energy o f ki. Your access to this 
energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your 
m onk level determines the number of points you have, 
as show n in the Ki Points colum n of the M onk table.
You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. 
You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, 
Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn m ore 
ki features as you gain levels in this class.
W hen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until 
you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you 
draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You 
must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to 
regain your ki points.
S om e of your ki features require your target to make 
a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving 
throw DC is calculated as follows:
Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifierFl u r r y  o f Bl o w s
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your 
turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make tw o unarm ed 
strikes as a bonus action.
Pa t i e n t  De f e n s e
You can spend 1 ki point to take the D odge action as a 
bonus action on your turn.
St e p  o f t h e  W i n d
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash 
action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump 
distance is doubled for the turn.
Un a r m o r e d  M o v e m e n t
Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet 
while you are not w earing arm or or wielding a shield. 
This bonus increases when you reach certain monk 
levels, as show n in the M onk table.
At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical 
surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling 
during the move.
Mo n a s t i c  T r a d i t i o n
W hen you reach 3rd level, you com m it yourself to a 
m onastic tradition: the Way o f the Open Hand, the Way 
o f Shadow, or the W ay o f the Four Elements, all detailed 
at the end of the class description. Your tradition 
grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, 
and 17th level.
De f l e c t  M i s s i l e s  
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to 
deflect or catch the missile w hen you are hit by a ranged 
weapon attack. W hen you do so, the damage you take 
from  the attack is reduced by 1d 10 + your Dexterity 
modifier + your m onk level.
If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the 
missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand 
and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a 
missile in this way, you can spend 1  ki point to make a 
ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition 
you just caught, as part of the sam e reaction. You make 
this attack with proficiency, regardless o f your w eapon 
proficiencies, and the missile counts as a m onk weapon 
for the attack.
Ab i l i t y  Sc o r e  Im p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
Sl o w  Fa l l
Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when 
you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an 
amount equal to five tim es your m onk level.

Ex t r a  At t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
St u n n i n g  St r i k e
Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of 
ki in an opponent’s body. W hen you hit another creature 
with a m elee w eapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to 
attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a 
Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of 
your next turn.
Ki- E m p o w e r e d  St r i k e s
Starting at 6th level, your unarm ed strikes count as 
magical for the purpose of overcom ing resistance and 
immunity to nonm agical attacks and damage.
Ev a s i o n
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge 
out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue 
dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball  spell. W hen you 
are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a 
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you 
instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving 
throw, and only half damage if you fail.
St i l l n e s s  o f M i n d
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one 
effect on yourself that is causing you to be charm ed 
or frightened.
P u r i t y  o f  B o d y
At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you 
m akes you im mune to disease and poison.
To n g u e  o f t h e  Su n  a n d  M o o n
Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other 
m inds so that you understand all spoken languages. 
Moreover, any creature that can understand a language 
can understand what you say.
Di a m o n d  So u l
Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you 
proficiency in all saving throws.
Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and 
fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the 
second result.During that time, you also have resistance to all damage 
but force damage.
Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the 
astral projection  spell, without needing material 
com ponents. W hen you do so, you can’t take any other 
creatures with you.
Pe r f e c t  Se l f
At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki 
points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.
Monastic  Traditions
Three traditions of m onastic pursuit are com m on in 
the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most 
m onasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a 
few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk 
according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three 
traditions rely on the sam e basic techniques, diverging 
as the student grow s m ore adept. Thus, a m onk need 
choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.
Wa y o f t h e  O p e n  H a n d  
M onks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate 
masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or 
unarm ed. They learn techniques to push and trip their 
opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their 
bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can 
protect them from  harm.
Op e n  H a n d  Te c h n i q u e
Starting w hen you choose this tradition at 3rd level, 
you can manipulate your enem y’s ki w hen you harness 
your own. W henever you hit a creature with one of the 
attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can im pose 
one of the following effects on that target:
•  It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be 
knocked prone.
•  It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you 
can push it up to 15 feet away from  you.
•  It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.
Wh o l e n e s s  o f Bo d y
At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an 
action, you can regain hit points equal to three times
Ti m e l e s s  B o d y  
At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer 
none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged 
magically. You can still die of old age, however. In 
addition, you no longer need food or water.
Em p t y  B o d y
Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to 
spend 4 ki points to becom e invisible for 1 minute.

your m onk level. You must finish a long rest before you 
can use this feature again.
Tr a n q u i l i t y
Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special 
meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At 
the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary  
spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the 
spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC 
for the spell equals 8 + your W isdom  modifier + your 
proficiency bonus.
Qu i v e r i n g  Pa l m
At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal 
vibrations in som eone’s body. W hen you hit a creature 
with an unarm ed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to 
start these im perceptible vibrations, which last for a 
number of days equal to your m onk level. The vibrations 
are harm less unless you use your action to end them.
To do so, you and the target must be on the sam e plane 
of existence. W hen you use this action, the creature 
must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is 
reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d 10 
necrotic damage.
You can have only one creature under the effect of this 
feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations 
harm lessly without using an action.
Wa y o f Sh a d o w  
M onks of the Way of Shadow  follow  a tradition that 
values stealth and subterfuge. These m onks might 
be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as 
spies and assassins. Som etim es the m em bers of a 
ninja monastery are family m em bers, form ing a clan 
sw orn to secrecy about their arts and m issions. Other 
m onasteries are m ore like thieves’ guilds, hiring out 
their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else 
w ho can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the 
heads of these m onasteries expect the unquestioning 
obedience of their students.
Sh a d o w  Ar t s
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you 
can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. 
As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast darkness,  
darkvision, pass without trace,  or silence,  without 
providing material com ponents. Additionally, you gain 
the minor illusion  cantrip if you don’t already know  it.
Sh a d o w  St e p
At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from  one shadow 
into another. W hen you are in dim light or darkness, 
as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an 
unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light 
or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee 
attack you make before the end of the turn.
Cl o a k  o f Sh a d o w s
By 11th level, you have learned to becom e one with 
the shadows. W hen you are in an area of dim light or 
darkness, you can use your action to becom e invisible. 
You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a 
spell, or are in an area of bright light.Op p o r t u n i s t
At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary 
distraction w hen it is hit by an attack. W henever a 
creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by 
a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to 
make a melee attack against that creature.
Wa y o f t h e  Fo u r  El e m e n t s
You follow  a monastic tradition that teaches you to 
harness the elements. W hen you focus your ki, you can 
align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the 
four elements to your will, using them as an extension 
of your body. Som e m em bers of this tradition dedicate 
themselves to a single element, but others weave the 
elements together.
Many m onks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with 
representations of their ki powers, com m only imagined 
as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, 
mountains, and cresting waves.
Di s c i p l e  o f t h e  El e m e n t s  
W hen you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn 
m agical disciplines that harness the pow er of the four 
elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points 
each time you use it.
You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and 
one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are 
detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below. 
You learn one additional elemental discipline of your 
choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
W henever you learn a new elemental discipline, 
you can also replace one elemental discipline that you 
already know with a different discipline.
Casting Elemental Spells.  S om e elemental 
disciplines allow you to cast spells. S ee chapter 10 for 
the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one o f these 
spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you 
don’t need to provide material com ponents for it.
O nce you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend 
additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental 
discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has 
an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands  
does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional 
ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level 
m onk and use Sw eeping Cinder Strike to cast burning  
hands,  you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level 
spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).
The maximum num ber of ki points you can spend to 
cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost 
and any additional ki points you spend to increase its 
level) is determined by your m onk level, as show n in the 
Spells and Ki Points table.

Mo n a s t ic  O rders
The worlds of D&D contain a multitude of monasteries 
and monastic traditions. In  lands with an Asian cultural 
flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten 
Realms, these monasteries are associated with philosophical 
traditions and martial arts practice. The Iron Hand School, 
the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and 
the Southern Star School of Shou Lung teach different 
approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines 
of the monk. Some of these monasteries have spread to the 
western lands of Faerun, particularly in places with large 
Shou immigrant communities, such as Thesk and Westgate.
Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who 
teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline.
In the Forgotten Realms, the order of the Dark Moon is 
made up of monks dedicated to Shar (goddess of loss), who 
maintain secret communities in remote hills, back allies, 
and subterranean hideaways. Monasteries of Ilmater (god 
of endurance) are named after flowers, and their orders 
carry the names of great heroes of the faith; the Disciples of 
Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of 
the Yellow Rose near Damara. The monasteries of Eberron 
combine the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship. 
Most are devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Host.
In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to 
Majere, god of meditation and thought. In  Greyhawk, many 
monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight 
and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of 
mental and physical mastery.
The evil monks of the Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of 
Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god 
but from dedication to the principles of their nation and their 
race— the belief that the Suel strand of humanity are meant 
to rule the world.

Pa l a d in  
Clad in plate arm or that gleam s in the sunlight despite 
the dust and grim e of long travel, a human lays down 
her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally 
w ounded man. Divine radiance shines from  her hands, 
the man’s w ounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide 
with amazement.
A dw arf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak 
making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches 
an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, 
he stalks into their midst and w hispers an oath, and two 
ores are dead before they even realize he is there.
Silver hair shining in a shaft o f light that seem s to 
illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His 
spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again 
at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcom es its 
hideous darkness.
Whatever their origin and their m ission, paladins are 
united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. 
W hether sw orn before a god’s altar and the w itness of 
a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey 
beings, or in a mom ent of desperation and grief with the 
dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful 
bond. It is a source of pow er that turns a devout warrior 
into a blessed champion.
Th e C a u s e  o f R i g h t e o u s n e s s
A paladin sw ears to uphold justice and righteousness, 
to stand with the good things of the world against the 
encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil 
wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various 
aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are 
bound by the oaths that grant them pow er to do their 
sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to 
gods of good, a paladin’s pow er com es as much from  a 
com m itm ent to justice itself as it does from  a god.
Paladins train for years to learn the skills o f combat, 
mastering a variety o f w eapons and armor. Even so, 
their martial skills are secondary to the m agical pow er 
they wield: pow er to heal the sick and injured, to smite 
the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent 
and those w ho join them in the fight for justice.

Alm ost by definition, the life of a paladin is an

evil. Fighters are rare enough am ong the ranks of the 
militias and arm ies of the world, but even fewer people 
can claim the true calling of a paladin. W hen they do 
receive the call, these w arriors turn from  their former 
occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Som etim es 
their oaths lead them into the service of the crow n as 
leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their 
loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to 
crow n and country.
Adventuring paladins take their w ork seriously. A  
delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest 
driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of 
treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, 
and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the 
cosm ic balance away from  oblivion.
Cr e a t i n g  a Pa l a d i n
The m ost important aspect of a paladin character is 
the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class 
features related to your oath don't appear until you 
reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading 
the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a 
devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and 
honor, a holy knight in shining arm or venturing forth 
to smite evil? Are you a glorious cham pion of the light, 
cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the 
shadow, a knight w hose oath descends from  traditions 
older than many o f the gods? Or are you an embittered 
loner sw orn to take vengeance on those w ho have done 
great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven 
by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities 
worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, suchas Torm, Tyr, Heironeous,
Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol 
Arrah, the Silver Flame,
Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, 
and Heimdall.
H ow  did you experience your call to 
serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper 
from  an unseen god or angel while you w ere at 
prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within 
you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did som e 
terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps— 
drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into 
a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found 
yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness 
and beauty. Or you might have known from  your earliest 
m em ories that the paladin’s life w as your calling, almost 
as if you had been sent into the w orld with that purpose 
stam ped on your soul.
As guardians against the forces of w ickedness, 
paladins are rarely o f any evil alignment. M ost of them 
walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how  your 
alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest 
and the manner in which you conduct yourself before 
gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be 
in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of 
behavior that you have not yet attained.

weapons
•  (a) five javelins or ( b) any simple melee weapon
•  (a) a priest’s pack or ( b) an explorer’s pack
•  Chain mail and a holy symbol
Di v i n e  Se n s e  
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like 
a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly 
m usic in your ears. As an action, you can open your 
awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know  the location of any celestial, fiend, 
or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total 
cover. You know  the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of 
any being w hose presence you sense, but not its identity 
(the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). 
Within the sam e radius, you also detect the presence 
o f any place or object that has been consecrated or 
desecrated, as with the hallow  spell.
You can use this feature a num ber of times equal to
1 + your Charisma modifier. W hen you finish a long rest, 
you regain all expended uses.
La y o n  H a n d s
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool 
o f healing pow er that replenishes when you take a long 
rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of 
hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.
As an action, you can touch a creature and draw 
pow er from the pool to restore a num ber of hit points 
to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining 
in your pool.
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from  your 
pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or 
neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple 
diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single 
use o f Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately 
for each one.
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your 
specialty. C hoose one of the follow ing options. You can’t 
take a Fighting Style option m ore than once, even if you 
later get to choose again.
De f e n s e
W hile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. 
Du e l i n g
W hen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and 
no other w eapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls 
with that weapon.
Gr e a t  We a p o n  Fi g h t i n g
W hen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you 
make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with 
two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new 
roll. The w eapon must have the two-handed or versatile 
property for you to gain this benefit.
Pr o t e c t i o n
W hen a creature you can see attacks a target other 
than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your 
reaction to im pose disadvantage on the attack roll.
You must be wielding a shield.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine 
m agic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as 
a cleric does. S ee chapter 10 for the general rules of 
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.
Pr e p a r i n g  a n d  Ca s t i n g  Sp e l l s
The Paladin table show s how  many spell slots you have 
to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 
1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s 
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when 
you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available 
for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. 
W hen you do so, ch oose a num ber of paladin spells 
equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin 
level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have 
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a 
Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include 
four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you 
prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds,  you can cast 
it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell 
doesn’t remove it from  your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you 
finish a long rest. Preparing a new  list o f paladin spells 
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1  
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Ab i l i t y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin 
spells, since their pow er derives from  the strength of

your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you 
use your Charisma m odifier when setting the saving 
throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making 
an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Fo c u s
You can use a holy sym bol (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.
Di v i n e  Sm i t e
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a 
m elee w eapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell 
slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to 
the w eapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 
1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher 
than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases 
by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.
Di v i n e  H e a l t h
By 3rd level, the divine m agic flowing through you 
m akes you im mune to disease.
Sa c r e d  O a t h
W hen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds 
you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been 
in a preparatory stage, com m itted to the path but not 
yet sw orn to it. N ow you ch oose the Oath of Devotion, 
the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all 
detailed at the end of the class description.
Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again 
at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. T hose features include oath 
spells and the Channel Divinity feature.
Oa t h  Sp e l l s
Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain 
access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath 
description. O nce you gain access to an oath spell, you 
always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against 
the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the 
paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin 
spell for you.
Ch a n n e l  Di v i n i t y
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel 
m agical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided 
by your oath explains how  to use it.
W hen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose 
which option to use. You must then finish a short or long 
rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
S om e Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. 
W hen you use such an effect from  this class, the DC 
equals your paladin spell save DC.Ab i l i t y  Sc o r e  Im p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
Ex t r a  At t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
Au r a  o f P r o t e c t i o n
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature 
within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the 
creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your 
Charisma m odifier (with a minim um  bonus of +1). You 
must be conscious to grant this bonus.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
Au r a  o f C o u r a g e
Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures 
within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you 
are conscious.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
Im p r o v e d  D i v i n e  Sm i t e
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous 
might that all your m elee w eapon strikes carry divine 
pow er with them. W henever you hit a creature with a 
melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant 
damage. If you also use your Divine Sm ite with an 
attack, you add this damage to the extra damage o f your 
Divine Smite.
Cl e a n s i n g  To u c h
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to 
end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature 
that you touch.
You can use this feature a number of tim es equal 
to your Charisma m odifier (a minim um o f once). You 
regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Sacred  Oath s
B ecom ing a paladin involves taking vows that com m it 
the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active 
path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken 
when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination 
of all the paladin’s training. S om e characters with this 
class don’t consider themselves true paladins until 
they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For 
others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, 
an official stamp on what has always been true in the 
paladin’s heart.
Oa t h  o f D e v o t i o n
The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest 
ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Som etim es called 
cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these 
paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor,

acting with honor in pursuit o f justice and the greater 
good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of 
conduct, and som e, for better or w orse, hold the rest of 
the world to the sam e standards. Many who swear this 
oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their 
gods’ tenets as the m easure o f their devotion. They hold 
angels—the perfect servants o f good—as their ideals, 
and incorporate im ages of angelic w ings into their 
helmets or coats of arms.
Te n e t s  o f De v o t i o n
Though the exact w ords and strictures of the Oath of 
Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.
Honesty.  D on’t lie or cheat. Let your w ord be 
your promise.
Courage.  Never fear to act, though caution is w ise. 
Compassion.  Aid others, protect the weak, and 
punish those w ho threaten them. Show  m ercy to your 
foes, but tem per it with wisdom .
Honor.  Treat others with fairness, and let your 
honorable deeds be an example to them. D o as 
much good as possible while causing the least 
amount of harm.
Duty.  Be responsible for your actions and their 
consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, 
and obey those w ho have just authority over you.
Oa t h  Sp e l l s
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.Br e a k in g  Yo u r  O a t h
A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, 
but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes 
the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation 
calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of 
emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.
A paladin who has broken a  vow typically seeks absolution 
from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another 
paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- 
night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a 
fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and 
forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.
If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no 
sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious.
At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be 
forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps 
to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the 
Dungeon Master's Guide.

or try to escape from  an effect that prevents it from

the D odge action.

10 feet o f you can’t be charm ed w hile you are conscious. 
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects 
of a protection from evil and good  spell.

At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of 
sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from  you in a 
30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.
W henever an enemy creature starts its turn in the 
bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.
In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on 
saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.
O nce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest.
Oa t h  o f t h e  A n c i e n t s
The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves 
and the rituals of the druids. Som etim es called fey 
knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins w ho 
swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light 
in the cosm ic struggle against darkness because they 
love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, 
not necessarily because they believe in principles of 
honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their arm or and 
clothing with im ages of grow ing things—leaves, antlers, 
or flow ers—to reflect their com m itm ent to preserving 
life and light in the world.
Te n e t s  o f t h e  An c i e n t s
The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been 
preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath 
emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns 
of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.Oa t h  o f De v o t i o n  Sp e l l s

W hen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the

Sacred Weapon.  As an action, you can imbue one 
weapon that you are holding with positive energy, 
using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add 
your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that 
weapon (with a minim um bonus of +1). The w eapon also 
emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 
feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it 
becom es magical for the duration.
You can end this effect on your turn as part of any 
other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying 
this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
Turn the Unholy.  As an action, you present your 
holy sym bol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and 
undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or 
undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you 
must make a W isdom  saving throw. If the creature 
fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1  minute or until 
it takes damage.
A  turned creature must spend its turns trying to move

Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks o f old

Using your action, you undergo a transformation.
For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

instead.

The Oath of Vengeance is a solem n com m itm ent to

evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire 
people turns against the w ill of the gods, when a thieves’ 
guild grow s too violent and powerful, when a dragon 
rampages through the countryside—at times like these, 
paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set

Te n e t s  o f Ve n g e a n c e
The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but 
all the tenets revolve around punishing w rongdoers by 
any m eans necessary. Paladins w ho uphold these tenets 
are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to 
mete out justice upon those w ho do evil, so the paladins 
are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The 
core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.
Fight the Greater Evil.  Faced with a choice of fighting 
my sw orn foes or com bating a lesser evil. I choose the 
greater evil.
No Mercy for the Wicked.  Ordinary foes might win 
my mercy, but my sworn enem ies do not.

A bju re Enem y.  As an action, you present your holy 
symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your 
Channel Divinity. C hoose one creature within 60 feet 
of you that you can see. That creature must make a 
W isdom  saving throw, unless it is immune to being

this saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1

On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved

of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet 
of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage 
on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until 
it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.
Re l e n t l e s s  Av e n g e r
By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close 
off a foe’s retreat. W hen you hit a creature with an 
opportunity attack, you can move up to half your 
speed immediately after the attack and as part of 
the sam e reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke 
opportunity attacks.
So u l  o f Ve n g e a n c e
Starting at 15th level, the authority with w hich you 
speak your Vow  of Enmity gives you greater pow er over 
your foe. W hen a creature under the effect o f your Vow 
o f Enmity m akes an attack, you can use your reaction to 
m ake a m elee weapon attack against that creature if it is 
within range.
Av e n g i n g  An g e l
At 20th level, you can assum e the form of an 
angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a 
transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following 
benefits:
•  W ings sprout from  your back and grant you a flying 
speed of 60 feet.
•  You emanate an aura of m enace in a 30-foot radius. 
The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or 
starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must 
succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or becom e fright­
ened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. 
Attack rolls against the frightened creature have 
advantage.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest.Oa t h  o f Ve n g e a n c e  Sp e l l s

Rough and wild looking, 
a human stalks alone 
through the shadows of 
trees, hunting the ores he 
know s are planning a raid 
on a nearby farm. Clutching 
a shortsw ord in each hand, 
he becom es a whirlwind of 
steel, cutting dow n one enemy 
after another.
After tumbling away from  a cone of 
freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws 
back her b ow  to loose an arrow at the white 
dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates 
from  the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends 
one arrow after another to find the gaps between the 
dragon’s thick scales.
Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk 
that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his 
side. W hispering instructions in Elvish, he points to 
the ow lbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to 
distract the creature while he readies his bow.
Far from  the bustle of cities and towns, past the 
hedges that shelter the m ost distant farms from  the 
terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of 
trackless forests and across w ide and empty plains, 
rangers keep their unending watch.
De a d l y  H u n t e r s  
W arriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in 
hunting the m onsters that threaten the edges of 
civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and 
monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They 
learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving 
stealthily through the w ilds and hiding themselves in 
brush and rubble. Rangers focus their com bat training 
on techniques that are particularly useful against their 
specific favored foes.
Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers 
acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s 
power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their 
com bat abilities, em phasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. 
A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly 
focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.
In d e p e n d e n t  A d v e n t u r e r s
Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a 
guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend 
the outskirts of civilization from  the ravages of monsters 
and humanoid hordes that press in from  the wild. In 
som e places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join 
forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are 
independent alm ost to a fault, knowing that, when a 
dragon or a band of orc s attacks, a ranger might be the 
first—and possibly the last—line o f defense.
This fierce independence m akes rangers w ell suited 
to adventuring, since they are accustom ed to life far 
from  the com forts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced 
with city-bred adventurers w ho grouse and whine about 
the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with som e

But they quickly learn that other adventurers w ho can 
carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s 
foes are w orth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might 
not know  how  to feed themselves or find fresh water in 
the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.
Cr e a t in g  a Ra n g e r
As you create your ranger character, consider the nature 
o f the training that gave you your particular capabilities. 
Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds 
together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you 
leave your apprenticeship, or w as your mentor slain— 
perhaps by the sam e kind of monster that becam e your 
favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as 
part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, 
trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You 
might be self-taught, a recluse w ho learned combat 
skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature 
through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.
W hat’s the source of your particular hatred of a 
certain kind of enemy? Did a m onster kill som eone 
you loved or destroy your hom e village? Or did you see 
too much of the destruction these monsters cause and 
com m it yourself to reining in their depredations? Is 
your adventuring career a continuation of your work 
in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change?W hat made you join up with a band of adventurers?
D o you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways 
of the wild, or do you w elcom e the relief from  solitude 
that they offer?
Qu i c k  Bu i l d
You can make a ranger quickly by follow ing these 
suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability 
score, followed by W isdom . (Som e rangers w ho focus 
on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to 
use the m agical essence of nature to cast spells, much 
as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of 
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.
Sp e l l  Sl o t s
The Ranger table show s how  many spell slots you have 
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of 
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level 
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal  
friendship  and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot 
available, you can cast animal friendship  using either slot.
Sp e l l s  K n o w n  o f 1s t Le v e l  a n d  H i g h e r

type of enemy.
C hoose a type o f favored enemy: aberrations, 
beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, 
fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.

You have advantage on W isdom  (Survival) checks to 
track your favored enem ies, as w ell as on Intelligence 
checks to recall information about them.
W hen you gain this feature, you also learn one 
language of your choice that is spoken by your favored 
enemies, if they speak one at all.
You ch oose one additional favored enemy, as well as 
an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you 
gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of 
monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
Na t u r a l  Ex p l o r e r

spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this 
class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, 
you can ch oose one of the ranger spells you know 
and replace it with another spell from the ranger 
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Ab i l i t y
W isdom  is your spellcasting ability for your ranger 
spells, since your m agic draws on your attunement to 
nature. You use your W isdom  whenever a spell refers 
to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your 
W isdom  modifier w hen setting the saving throw DC for 
a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll 
with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
Ra n g e r  A r c h e t y p e
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive 
to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at 
the end of the class description. Your choice grants 
you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, 
and 15th level.
Pr i m e v a l  A w a r e n e s s
Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and 
expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on 
the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell 
slot you expend, you can sense whether the following 
types of creatures are present within 1  mile of you (or 
within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): 
aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, 
and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ 
location or number.Ab i l i t y  Sc o r e  Im p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
Ex t r a  A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
La n d ’s St r i d e
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonm agical 
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can 
also pass through nonm agical plants without being 
slowed by them and without taking damage from  them if 
they have thorns, spines, or a sim ilar hazard.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws 
against plants that are magically created or manipulated 
to im pede movement, such those created by the 
entangle  spell.
Hid e  i n P l a i n  Si g h t  
Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating 
cam ouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh 
mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring 
materials with which to create your camouflage.
Once you are cam ouflaged in this way, you can try 
to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, 
such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and w ide 
as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) 
checks as long as you remain there without moving or 
taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a 
reaction, you must cam ouflage yourself again to gain 
this benefit.
Va n i s h
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a 
bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by 
nonm agical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
Fe r a l  Se n s e s
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help 
you fight creatures you can’t see. W hen you attack a 
creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t 
im pose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.
You are also aware of the location of any invisible 
creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the 
creature isn’t hidden from  you and you aren’t 
blinded or deafened.
Fo e Sl a y e r
At 20th level, you becom e an unparalleled hunter of your 
enemies. O nce on each of your turns, you can add your 
W isdom  modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of 
an attack you make against one o f your favored enemies. 
You can choose to use this feature before or after the 
roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

Ra n g e r  Archetypes
The ideal o f the ranger has two classic expressions: the 
Hunter and the Beast Master.
Hu n t e r
Emulating the Hunter archetype m eans accepting your 
place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors 
of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you 
learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats 
you face, from  rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to 
towering giants and terrifying dragons.
Hu n t e r ’s Pr e y
At 3rd level, you gain one of the follow ing features 
of your choice.
Colossus Slayer.  Your tenacity can w ear down 
the m ost potent foes. W hen you hit a creature with a 
weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage 
if it’s below  its hit point maximum. You can deal this 
extra damage only once per turn.
Giant Killer.  W hen a Large or larger creature within
5 feet of you hits or m isses you with an attack, you can 
use your reaction to attack that creature immediately 
after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
Horde Breaker.  O nce on each o f your turns w hen you 
make a w eapon attack, you can make another attack 
with the sam e weapon against a different creature that 
is within 5 feet of the original target and within range 
of your weapon.
De f e n s i v e  Ta c t i c s
At 7th level, you gain one of the following features 
o f your choice.
Escape the Horde.  Opportunity attacks against you 
are made with disadvantage.
Multiattack Defense.  W hen a creature hits you 
with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against 
all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the 
rest of the turn.
Steel Will.  You have advantage on saving throws 
against being frightened.
Mu l t i a t t a c k
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features 
o f your choice.
Volley.  You can use your action to make a ranged 
attack against any num ber of creatures within 10 feet 
o f a point you can see within your w eapon’s range. You 
must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and 
you make a separate attack roll for each target.
Whirlwind Attack.  You can use your action to make a 
m elee attack against any number o f creatures within 5 
feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.
Su p e r i o r  Hu n t e r ’s De f e n s e
At 15th level, you gain one of the following features 
o f your choice.
Evasion.  You can nimbly dodge out of the way of 
certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath 
or a lightning bolt  spell. W hen you are subjected to an 
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw 
to take only half damage, you instead take no damageif you succeed on the saving throw, and only half 
damage if you fail.
Stand Against the Tide.  W hen a hostile creature 
m isses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction 
to force that creature to repeat the sam e attack against 
another creature (other than itself) of your choice.
Uncanny Dodge.  W hen an attacker that you can see 
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to 
halve the attack’s damage against you.
Be a s t  M a s t e r
The Beast Master archetype em bodies a friendship 
between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. 
United in focus, beast and ranger w ork as one to fight 
the m onstrous foes that threaten civilization and the 
w ilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype 
m eans com m itting yourself to this ideal, w orking in 
partnership with an animal as its com panion and friend.
Ra n g e r ’s Co m p a n i o n
At 3rd level, you gain a beast com panion that 
accom panies you on your adventures and is trained to 
fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than 
Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower 
(appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff, 
and panther as examples). Add your proficiency bonus 
to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well 
as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its 
hit point maximum equals its norm al maximum or four 
tim es your ranger level, whichever is higher.
The beast obeys your com m ands as best as it can. It 
takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an 
action unless you com m and it to. On your turn, you can 
verbally com m and the beast w here to m ove (no action 
required by you). You can use your action to verbally 
com m and it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, 
or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, 
you can make one w eapon attack yourself when you 
com m and the beast to take the Attack action.
W hile traveling through your favored terrain with only 
the beast, you can m ove stealthily at a norm al pace.
If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by 
spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast 
that isn’t hostile to you, either the sam e type of beast as 
before or a different one.
Ex c e p t i o n a l  Tr a i n i n g
Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when 
your beast com panion doesn’t attack, you can use a 
bonus action to com m and the beast to take the Dash, 
Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on its turn.
Be s t i a l  Fu r y
Starting at 11th level, your beast com panion can 
make two attacks when you com m and it to use the 
Attack action.
Sh a r e  Sp e l l s
Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting 
yourself, you can also affect your beast com panion with 
the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.

R ogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of 
a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their com bat 
abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other 
characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and 
deception, while others refine the skills that help them 
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and 
disarm ing traps, and opening locks.
W hen it com es to combat, rogues prioritize cunning 
over brute strength. A  rogue w ould rather make one 
precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will 
hurt the target most, than w ear an opponent down 
with a barrage of attacks. R ogues have an almost 
supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn 
magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.
A  S h a d y  Li v i n g
Every town and city has its share of rogues. M ost of 
them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, 
m aking a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and 
con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized 
into thieves’ guilds or crim e families. Plenty of rogues 
operate independently, but even they som etim es 
recruit apprentices to help them in their scam s 
and heists. A few rogues make an honest living asRog ue

lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into 
the shadows as her fighter friend m oves forward to kick 
the door open.
A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his 
accom plice prepares for her part in the ambush. W hen

In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is

their escape.
R ogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ 
vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. 
They have a knack for finding the solution to just about 
any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and 
versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful

Cr e a t i n g  a R o g u e  
As you create your rogue character, consider the 
character’s relationship to the law. D o you have a 
criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from  the 
law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you 
leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger

You can make a rogue quickly by following 
these suggestions. First. Dexterity should 
be your highest ability score. Make 
Intelligence your next-highest if you want to 
excel at Investigation or plan to take up the 
Arcane Trickster archetype. C hoose Charisma 
instead if you plan to em phasize deception and social

You start with the following equipment, in addition to 
the equipment granted by your background:
•  (a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword
•  (a) a shortbow  and quiver of 20 arrows or ( b) a 
shortsword
•  (a) a burglar’s pack, ( b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) an 
explorer’s pack
•  Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools
Ex p e r t i s e  
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or 
one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with 
thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any 
ability check you m ake that uses either of the chosen 
proficiencies.
At 6th level, you can choose two m ore of your 
proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain 
this benefit.
Sn e a k  At t a c k
Beginning at 1st level, you know  how  to strike subtly 
and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can 
deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with 
an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The 
attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another 
enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy 
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on 
the attack roll.
The amount of the extra damage increases as you 
gain levels in this class, as show n in the Sneak Attack 
colum n of the Rogue table.
Th i e v e s ’ C a n t
During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a 
secret m ix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to 
hide m essages in seem ingly norm al conversation. Only 
another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands 
such m essages. It takes four tim es longer to convey such 
a m essage than it does to speak the sam e idea plainly.
In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and 
sym bols used to convey short, simple m essages, such 
as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a 
thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether thepeople in an area are easy m arks or will provide a safe 
house for thieves on the run.
Cu n n i n g  A c t i o n
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility 
allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a 
bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This 
action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, 
or Hide action.
Ro g u i s h  A r c h e t y p e
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate 
in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, 
or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class 
description. Your archetype choice grants you features 
at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
Ab i l i t y  Sc o r e  Im p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score 
of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability 
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase 
an ability score above 20 using this feature.
Un c a n n y  D o d g e
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see 
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to 
halve the attack’s damage against you.
Ev a s i o n
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out o f the 
way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery 
breath or an ice storm  spell. W hen you are subjected 
to an effect that allows you to m ake a Dexterity saving 
throw to take only half damage, you instead take no 
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only 
half damage if you fail.
Re l i a b l e  T a l e n t
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until 
they approach perfection. W henever you make an ability 
check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can 
treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
Bl i n d s e n s e  
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are 
aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature 
within 10 feet of you.
Sl i p p e r y  M i n d
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental 
strength. You gain proficiency in W isdom  saving throws.
El u s i v e
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that 
attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No 
attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t 
incapacitated.

St r o k e  o f L u c k
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding 
w hen you need to. If your attack m isses a target within 
range, you can turn the m iss into a hit. Alternatively, if 
you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
O nce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
Ro g u ish  Archetypes
R ogues have many features in com m on, including their 
emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and 
deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick 
reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in 
varying directions, em bodied by the rogue archetypes. 
Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus— 
not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, 
but a description of your preferred techniques.
Th i e f
You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, 
bandits, cutpurses, and other crim inals typically follow  
this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of 
themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, 
delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your 
agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into 
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using 
m agic items you normally couldn’t employ.
Fa s t  Ha n d s
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action 
granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to 
disarm  a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an 
Object action.
Se c o n d - St o r y  Wo r k
W hen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain 
the ability to climb faster than normal; clim bing no 
longer costs you extra movement.
In addition, when you make a running jump, the 
distance you cover increases by a num ber of feet equal 
to your Dexterity modifier.
Su p r e m e  Sn e a k
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity 
(Stealth) check if you move no m ore than half your 
speed on the same turn.
Use M a g i c  De v i c e
By 13th level, you have learned enough about the 
workings of m agic that you can im provise the use of 
items even when they are not intended for you. You 
ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use 
of m agic items.
Th i e f ’s Re f l e x e s
W hen you reach 17th level, you have becom e adept at 
laying am bushes and quickly escaping danger. You can 
take two turns during the first round of any combat. You 
take your first turn at your norm al initiative and yoursecond turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use 
this feature when you are surprised.
As s a s s i n
You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those 
w ho adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, 
spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed 
priests trained to exterminate the enem ies of their deity. 
Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your 
foes with deadly efficiency.
Bo n u s  Pr o f i c i e n c i e s
W hen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain 
proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner’s kit.
As s a s s i n a t e
Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest w hen you 
get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on 
attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn 
in the com bat yet. In addition, any hit you score against 
a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
In f i l t r a t i o n  Ex p e r t i s e
Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false 
identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 
25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations 
for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that 
belongs to som eone else. For example, you might acquire 
appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official- 
looking certification to establish yourself as a mem ber of 
a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate 
yourself into the com pany of other wealthy merchants.
Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, 
other creatures believe you to be that person until given 
an obvious reason not to.
Im p o s t o r
At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly m im ic 
another person’s speech, writing, and behavior.
You must spend at least three hours studying 
these three com ponents of the person’s behavior, 
listening to speech, exam ining handwriting, and 
observing mannerisms.
Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a 
wary creature suspects som ething is am iss, you have 
advantage on any Charisma (D eception) check you make 
to avoid detection.
De a t h  St r i k e
Starting at 17th level, you becom e a master of instant 
death. W hen you attack and hit a creature that is 
surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw 
(DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency 
bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your 
attack against the creature.
Ar c a n e  T r i c k s t e r  
S om e rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth 
and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment 
and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and 
burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-m akers, and a 
significant number of adventurers.

Sp e l l c a s t in g
W hen you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to 
cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of 
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the w izard spell list.
Cantrips.  You learn three cantrips: mage hand  and 
two other cantrips of your choice from  the wizard spell 
list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice 
at 10th level.
Spell Slots.  The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting 
table show s how many spell slots you have to cast 
your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these 
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or 
higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm  
person  and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot 
available, you can cast charm person  using either slot.
Spells Known o f 1st-Level and Higher.  You know 
three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which 
you must choose from the enchantment and illusion 
spells on the w izard spell list.
The Spells Known colum n of the Arcane Trickster 
Spellcasting table show s w hen you learn m ore wizard 
spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must 
be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For 
instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can 
learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can 
com e from  any school of magic.
W henever you gain a level in this class, you can 
replace one o f the w izard spells you know  with another 
spell of your choice from  the w izard spell list. The 
new  spell must be of a level for which you have spell 
slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, 
unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, 
or 20th level.
Spellcasting Ability.  Intelligence is your spellcasting 
ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your 
spells through dedicated study and memorization.
You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to 
your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your 
Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw 
DC for a w izard spell you cast and when making an 
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8  + your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier
Ma g e  H a n d  L e g e r d e m a in
Starting at 3rd level, when you cast mage hand,  you can 
make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform  
the follow ing additional tasks with it:
•  You can stow one object the hand is holding in a 
container w orn or carried by another creature.
•  You can retrieve an object in a container w orn or 
carried by another creature.
•  You can use thieves’ tools to pick locks and disarm 
traps at range.Ar c a n e  Tr i c k s t e r  Sp e l l c a s t i n g

You can perform  one of these tasks without being

(Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature’s 
W isdom  (Perception) check.
In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by 
your Cunning Action to control the hand.
Ma g i c a l  Am b u s h
Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from  a 
creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has 
disadvantage on any saving throw it m akes against the 
spell this turn.
Ve r s a t il e  Tr ic k s t e r
At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with 
your mage hand.  As a bonus action on your turn, you can 
designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand 
created by the spell. D oing so gives you advantage on 
attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.
Sp e l l  Th ie f
At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically 
steal the knowledge of how  to cast a spell from 
another spellcaster.
Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets 
you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your 
reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw 
with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals 
your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the 
spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge 
of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can 
cast (it doesn’t need to be a w izard spell). For the next 
8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your 
spell slots. The creature can’t cast that spell until the 
8 hours have passed.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest.

Sorcerer
Golden eyes flashing, a human 
stretches out her hand and unleashes 
the dragonfire that burns in her veins.
As an inferno rages around her foes, 
leathery w ings spread from her back and 
she takes to the air.
Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, 
a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws 
his head back. Lifting him momentarily off 
the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, 
through him, and out from  him in a mighty blast 
o f lightning.
Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a 
finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs 
from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back 
behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her 
wild m agic has turned her skin bright blue.
Sorcerers carry a m agical birthright conferred 
upon them by an exotic bloodline, som e otherworldly 
influence, or exposure to unknow n cosm ic forces.
One can ’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any 
m ore than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one 
ch ooses sorcery; the pow er ch ooses the sorcerer.
Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, 
and spirit with a latent pow er that waits to be tapped. 
S om e sorcerers wield m agic that springs from  an 
ancient bloodline infused with the m agic of dragons. 
Others carry a raw, uncontrolled m agic within them, 
a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.
The appearance of sorcerous pow ers is wildly 
unpredictable. S om e draconic bloodlines produce 
exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other 
lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most 
o f the time, the talents o f sorcery appear as apparent 
flukes. S om e sorcerers can’t name the origin of their 
power, while others trace it to strange events in their 
ow n lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a 
dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from 
a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery.
S o too might the gift of a deity of m agic, exposure 
to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the 
maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glim pse into the 
inner workings of reality.
Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient 
tom es of m agic lore that w izards rely on, nor do they 
rely on a patron to grant their spells as w arlocks do.
By learning to harness and channel their own inborn 
magic, they can discover new and staggering ways 
to unleash that power.
Un e x p l a i n e d  P o w e r s  
Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find 
a sorcerer w ho is not involved in the adventuring life 
in som e way. People with magical pow er seething in 
their veins soon discover that the pow er doesn’t like to 
stay quiet. A sorcerer’s m agic wants to be wielded, and 
it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if 
it isn’t called on.Ra w  M a g i c

Sorcerers often 
have obscure or quixotic 
motivations driving them 
to adventure. Som e seek a greater 
understanding of the m agical force that infuses 
them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others 
hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full 
potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit 
as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making 
up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical 
knowledge with enorm ous flexibility in using the 
spells they know.
Cr e a t i n g  a So r c e r e r  
The most important question to consider when creating 
your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting 
character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic 
bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact 
source of your pow er is up to you to decide. Is it a family 
curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or 
did som e extraordinary event leave you blessed with 
inherent m agic but perhaps scarred as well?
H ow  do you feel about the magical pow er coursing 
through you? D o you em brace it, try to master it, or 
revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or 
a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did 
you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you 
had? W hat do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you 
feel like you’ve been given this pow er for som e lofty 
purpose. Or you might decide that the pow er gives you 
the right to do what you want, to take what you want 
from those w ho lack such power. Perhaps your pow erlinks you to a pow erful individual in the w orld—the fey 
creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon w ho put 
a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created 
you as an experiment, or the deity w ho chose you to 
carry this power.
Qu i c k  Bu i l d
You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest 
ability score, follow ed by Constitution. Second, 
choose the hermit background. Third, choose the 
light, prestidigitation, ray o f frost,  and shocking grasp  
cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells shield  and 
magic missile.

As a sorcerer, you gain the following class features.
Hi t Po i n t s

•  (a) a light crossbow  and 20 bolts or ( b) any simple 
w eapon
•  (a) a com ponent pouch or (b) an arcane focus

•  Two daggers
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  
An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or 
ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with 
arcane m agic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, 
fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of 
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.
Ca n t r ip s
At 1st level, you know  four cantrips of your choice from 
the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer 
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as show n in the 
Cantrips Known colum n of the Sorcerer table.
Sp e l l  Sl o t s
The Sorcerer table show s how  many spell slots you 
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast 
one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of 
the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell 
slots w hen you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know  the 1st-level spell burning  
hands  and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot 
available, you can cast burning hands  using either slot.
Spells  K n o w n  o f 1st Le v e l  a n d  H ig h e r
You know two 1st-level spells o f your choice from the 
sorcerer spell list.
The Spells K now n colum n of the Sorcerer table 
show s when you learn more sorcerer spells of your 
choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which 
you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd 
level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st 
or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, 
you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know 
and replace it with another spell from  the sorcerer 
spell list, which also must be of a level for w hich you 
have spell slots.
Sp e l l c a s t in g  Ab il it y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer 
spells, since the pow er of your m agic relies on your 
ability to project your w ill into the world. You use your 
Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting 
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier 
when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell 
you cast and w hen making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8  + your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifierSp e l l c a s t in g  Fo c u s
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.
So r c e r o u s  O r i g i n  
Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the 
source of your innate magical power: D raconic 
Bloodline or W ild Magic, both detailed at the end of the 
class description.
Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 
1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.
Fo n t  o f M a g i c
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic 
within yourself. This wellspring is represented by 
sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of 
magical effects.
So r c e r y  Po in t s
You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain m ore as you 
reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points 
colum n of the Sorcerer table. You can never have 
m ore sorcery points than shown on the table for your 
level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you 
finish a long rest.
Fl e x ib l e  Ca s t i n g
You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell 
slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery

Sorcerous  Origins
Different sorcerers claim  different origins for their 
innate magic. Although many variations exist, most 
of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic 
bloodline and wild magic.
Dr a c o n i c  B l o o d l i n e  
Your innate m agic com es from  draconic m agic that was 
mingled with your blood or that o f your ancestors. M ost 
often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent 
back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times w ho made a 
bargain with a dragon or who might even have claim ed 
a dragon parent. S om e of these bloodlines are well 
established in the world, but m ost are obscure. Any 
given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a 
result of a pact or som e other exceptional circum stance.
Dr a g o n  An c e s t o r
At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your 
ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon 
is used by features you gain later.

Dragon Damage Type

You can speak, read, and write D raconic. Additionally, 
whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting 
with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it 
applies to the check.
Dr a c o n ic  Re sil ie n c e
As m agic flows through your body, it causes physical 
traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, 
your hit point maximum increases by 1  and increases by 
1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin 
sheen of dragon-like scales. W hen you aren’t wearing 
armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
El e m e n t a l  Af f i n i t y
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals 
damage of the type associated with your draconic 
ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to that damage.
At the sam e time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain 
resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

Dr a g o n  W i n g s
At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of 
dragon wings from  your back, gaining a flying speed 
equal to your current speed. You can create these w ings 
as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you 
dism iss them as a bonus action on your turn.
You can’t manifest your w ings while w earing armor 
unless the arm or is made to accom m odate them, and 
clothing not made to accom m odate your w ings might 
be destroyed when you manifest them.
Dr a c o n i c  Pr e s e n c e
Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread 
presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around 
you to becom e awestruck or frightened. As an action, 
you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power 
and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a 
distance of 60 feet. For 1  minute or until you lose your 
concentration (as if you w ere casting a concentration 
spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this 
aura must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or be 
charm ed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose 
fear) until the aura ends. A  creature that succeeds on 
this saving throw is im mune to your aura for 24 hours.
Wi l d  M a g i c
Your innate m agic com es from  the wild forces of chaos 
that underlie the order of creation. You might have 
endured exposure to som e form o f raw magic, perhaps 
through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental 
Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you 
were blessed by a pow erful fey creature or marked by a 
demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with 
no apparent cause or reason. However it cam e to be, this 
chaotic m agic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
Wi l d M a g i c  Su r g e
Starting w hen you choose this origin at 1st level, your 
spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. 
Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level 
or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 
1, roll on the W ild Magic Surge table to create a random 
magical effect.
Tid e s  o f Ch a o s
Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of 
chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, 
ability check, or saving throw. O nce you do so, you must 
finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the 
DM can have you roll on the W ild Magic Surge table 
immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or 
higher. You then regain the use of this feature.
Be n d  Lu c k
Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate 
using your w ild magic. W hen another creature you can 
see m akes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving 
throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery 
points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a 
bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. Youcan do so after the creature rolls but before any effects 
of the roll occur.
Co n t r o l l e d  Ch a o s
At 14th level, you gain a m odicum  of control over the 
surges of your wild magic. W henever you roll on the 
W ild M agic Surge table, you can roll twice and use 
either number.
Sp e l l  Bo m b a r d m e n t
Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your 
spells intensifies. W hen you roll damage for a spell and 
roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, 
choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to 
the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

Wa r l o c k
With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young 
elf in golden robes sm iles warmly, weaving a magical 
charm  into his honeyed w ords and bending the palace 
sentinel to his will.
As flames spring to life in her hands, a w izened 
human w hispers the secret name of her dem onic patron, 
infusing her spell with fiendish magic.
Shifting his gaze betw een a battered tome and the 
odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling 
chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a 
distant world.
W arlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies 
hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts 
made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, 
w arlocks unlock m agical effects both subtle and 
spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of 
beings such as fey nobles, dem ons, devils, hags, and 
alien entities o f the Far Realm, w arlocks piece together 
arcane secrets to bolster their own power.
Sw o r n  a n d  B e h o l d e n
A w arlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly 
being. Som etim es the relationship between w arlock 
and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though 
the beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are not 
gods. A w arlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon 
prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings 
not typically served by clerics. M ore often, though, the 
arrangement is similar to that between a master and 
an apprentice. The w arlock learns and grow s in power, 
at the cost o f occasional services perform ed on the 
patron’s behalf.
The m agic bestow ed on a w arlock ranges from  minor 
but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as 
the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) 
to access to pow erful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, 
w arlocks supplement their m agic with som e facility 
at hand-to-hand combat. They are com fortable in light 
arm or and know  how  to use simple weapons.
De l v e r s  i n t o  Se c r e t s
W arlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge 
and power, which com pels them into their pacts and 
shapes their lives. This thirst drives w arlocks into their 
pacts and shapes their later careers as well.
Stories of w arlocks binding themselves to fiends are 
widely known. But many w arlocks serve patrons that 
are not fiendish. Som etim es a traveler in the wilds 
com es to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord 
or lady, and stum bles into a pact without being fully 
aware of it. And som etim es, while poring over tom es of

forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is 
opened to realities beyond the material world and to the 
alien beings that dwell in the outer void.
Once a pact is made, a w arlock’s thirst for knowledge 
and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. 
No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or 
she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, 
the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active 
pursuit of their goals, which typically means som e kind 
of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their 
patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.
Cr e a t i n g  a W a r l o c k
As you make your w arlock character, spend som e time 
thinking about your patron and the obligations that 
your pact im poses upon you. W hat led you to make the 
pact, and how  did you make contact with your patron? 
W ere you seduced into sum m oning a devil, or did you 
seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact 
with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, 
or did your patron find and choose you? D o you chafe 
under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in 
anticipation o f the rewards prom ised to you?
W ork with your DM to determine how  big a part your 
pact will play in your character’s adventuring career.Your patron’s dem ands might drive you into adventures, 
or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do 
between adventures.
W hat kind of relationship do you have with your 
patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? 
H ow  important does your patron consider you to be? 
W hat part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you 
know  other servants of your patron?
How does your patron com m unicate with you? If 
you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with 
your patron’s voice. Som e warlocks find m essages 
from  their patrons etched on trees, mingled am ong tea 
leaves, or adrift in the clouds—m essages that only the 
w arlock can see. Other w arlocks converse with their 
patrons in dream s or waking visions, or deal only with 
intermediaries.
Qu i c k  Bu i l d
You can make a w arlock quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest 
ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose 
the charlatan background. Third, choose the eldritch  
blast  and chill touch  cantrips, along with the 1st-level 
spells ray o f sickness  and witch bolt.

As a warlock, you gain the following class features.
Hi t Po i n t s

You start with the following equipment, in addition to 
the equipment granted by your background:
•  (a) a light crossbow  and 20 bolts or (b) any simple 
w eapon
•  (a) a com ponent pouch or ( b) an arcane focus
•  (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack
•  Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers
Ot h e r w o r l d l y  Pa t r o n
At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an 
otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the 
Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed 
at the end of the class description. Your choice 
grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, 
and 14th level.
Pa c t  M a g i c
Your arcane research and the m agic bestow ed on you 
by your patron have given you facility with spells. See 
chapter 10 for the general rules o f spellcasting and 
chapter 11 for the w arlock spell list.
Ca n t r i p s
You know  two cantrips of your choice from  the w arlock 
spell list. You learn additional w arlock cantrips of your 
choice at higher levels, as show n in the Cantrips Known 
colum n of the W arlock table.
Sp e l l  Sl o t s
The W arlock table shows how many spell slots you have. 
The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all 
o f your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your 
w arlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a 
spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a short or long rest.
For example, when you are 5th level, you have 
tw o 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell 
thunderwave,  you must spend one of those slots, and 
you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
Sp e l l s  K n o w n  o f 1s t Le v e l  a n d  H i g h e r  
At 1st level, you know  two 1st-level spells of your choice 
from  the w arlock spell list.
The Spells Known colum n of the W arlock table shows 
when you learn m ore w arlock spells of your choice of 1st 
level and higher. A  spell you choose must be of a level 
no higher than what’s show n in the table's Slot Level 
colum n for your level. W hen you reach 6th level, for 
example, you learn a new w arlock spell, which can be 
1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, 
you can choose one of the w arlock spells you know 
and replace it with another spell from the warlock 
spell list, which also must be of a level for w hich you 
have spell slots.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Ab i l i t y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your w arlock 
spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers 
to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your 
Charisma modifier w hen setting the saving throw DC 
for a w arlock spell you cast and w hen making an attack 
roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Fo c u s
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your w arlock spells.
El d r i t c h  In v o c a t i o n s  
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch 
invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that 
imbue you with an abiding magical ability.
At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your 
choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end 
of the class description. W hen you gain certain w arlock 
levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, 
as show n in the Invocations Known colum n of the 
W arlock table.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, 
you can choose one of the invocations you know  and 
replace it with another invocation that you could learn 
at that level.
Pa c t  B o o n
At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestow s a gift 
upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the 
following features of your choice.
Pa c t  o f t h e  Ch a i n
You learn the find familiar  spell and can cast it as a 
ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of 
spells known.
W hen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the 
norm al form s for your familiar or one of the following 
special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can 
forgo one of your own attacks to allow  your familiar to 
make one attack o f its own.
Pa c t  o f t h e  Bl a d e
You can use your action to create a pact w eapon in your 
empty hand. You can choose the form  that this melee 
w eapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for 
w eapon options). You are proficient with it while you 
w ield it. This w eapon counts as m agical for the purpose 
o f overcom ing resistance and immunity to nonm agical 
attacks and damage.

Your pact w eapon disappears if it is m ore than 5 feet 
away from  you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears 
if you use this feature again, if you dism iss the w eapon 
(no action required), or if you die.
You can transform one m agic w eapon into your pact 
weapon by perform ing a special ritual while you hold 
the weapon. You perform  the ritual over the course 
of 1  hour, which can be done during a short rest.
You can then dism iss the weapon, shunting it into an 
extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you 
create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an 
artifact or a sentient w eapon in this way. The weapon 
ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform  
the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use 
a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon 
appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space 
when the bond breaks.
Pa c t  o f t h e  To m e
Your patron gives you a grim oire called a B ook of 
Shadows. W hen you gain this feature, choose three 
cantrips from any class’s spell list. W hile the book  is on 
your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They 
don’t count against your number of cantrips known.
If you lose your B ook o f Shadows, you can perform  
a 1-hour cerem ony to receive a replacement from  your 
patron. This cerem ony can be perform ed during a short 
or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book 
turns to ash when you die.
Ab i l i t y  Sc o r e  Im p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
My s t i c  A r c a n u m
At 11th level, your patron bestow s upon you a magical 
secret called an arcanum. C hoose one 6th-level spell 
from  the w arlock spell list as this arcanum.
You can cast your arcanum spell once without 
expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before 
you can do so again.
At higher levels, you gain m ore w arlock spells of your 
choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell 
at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 
9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your 
Mystic Arcanum  when you finish a long rest.
El d r i t c h  M a s t e r
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of 
mystical pow er while entreating your patron to regain 
expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating 
your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots 
from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots 
with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you 
can do so again.Yo u r  Pa c t Bo o n
Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an 
object that reflects your patron’s nature.
Pact o f the Chain.  Your familiar is more cunning than a  
typical familiar. Its default form can be a  reflection of your 
patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey 
and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old 
One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.
Pact o f the Blade.  If your patron is the Archfey, your 
weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines.
If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made 
of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your 
patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an 
ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its 
head, carved to look like a  terrible unblinking eye.
Pact o f the Tome.  Your Book of Shadows might be a  fine, 
gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, 
gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome 
bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of 
conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister 
regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the 
tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the 
Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own 
burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast. 
O t h e r w o r ld ly  P a tro n s
The beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are 
mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not 
gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons 
give their w arlocks access to different pow ers and 
invocations, and expect significant favors in return.
Som e patrons collect w arlocks, doling out mystic 
knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability 
to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow  their 
pow er only grudgingly, and might make a pact with 
only one warlock. W arlocks w ho serve the same patron 
might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.
Th e A r c h f e y
Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of 
legend w ho holds secrets that w ere forgotten before 
the mortal races w ere born. This being’s motivations 
are often inscrutable, and som etim es whimsical, and 
might involve a striving for greater magical pow er or the 
settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include 
the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, 
ruler of the Gloam ing Court; Titania of the Sum m er 
Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, 
the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.
Ex p a n d e d  Sp e l l  Li s t
The Archfey lets you choose from  an expanded list of 
spells w hen you learn a w arlock spell. The following 
spells are added to the w arlock spell list for you.

Spell Level Spells
1st faerie fire, sleep
2nd calm emotions, phantasm al force
3rd blink, plant growth
4th dominate beast, greater invisibility
5th dominate person, seeming

Fe y Pr e s e n c e
Starting at 1st level, your patron bestow s upon you the 
ability to project the beguiling and fearsom e presence 
of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in 
a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a W isdom  
saving throw against your w arlock spell save DC. The 
creatures that fail their saving throws are all charm ed 
or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of 
your next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
Mi s t y  Es c a p e
Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in 
response to harm. W hen you take damage, you can use 
your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet 
to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible 
until the start of your next turn or until you attack or 
cast a spell.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
Be g u i l i n g  De f e n s e s
Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how  to 
turn the mind-affecting m agic of your enem ies against 
them. You are immune to being charm ed, and when 
another creature attempts to charm  you, you can use 
your reaction to attempt to turn the charm  back on 
that creature. The creature must succeed on a W isdom  
saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or 
be charm ed by you for 1 minute or until the creature 
takes any damage.
Da r k  De l i r i u m
Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into 
an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature 
that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a 
W isdom  saving throw against your w arlock spell save 
DC. On a failed save, it is charm ed or frightened by you 
(your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration 
is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This 
effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.
Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost 
in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. 
The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and 
the illusion.
You must finish a short or long rest before you can 
use this feature again.
Th e F i e n d  
You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower 
planes o f existence, a being w hose aims are evil, 
even if you strive against those aims. Such beings 
desire the corruption or destruction of all things, 
ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to 
forge a pact include dem on lords such as D em ogorgon, 
Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such 
as Asm odeus, Dispater, M ephistopheles, and Belial; 
pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and 
ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.Ex p a n d e d  Sp e l l  Li s t
The Fiend lets you choose from  an expanded list of 
spells when you learn a w arlock spell. The following 
spells are added to the w arlock spell list for you.
Fie n d  Ex p a n d e d  Sp el l s
Spell Level Spells
1st burning hands, com m and
2nd blindness/deafness, scorching ray
3rd fireball, stinking cloud
4th fire shield, wall o f fire
5th flam e strike, hallow
Da r k  On e’s Bl e s s i n g
Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature 
to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your 
Charisma m odifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).
Da r k  On e’s O w n Lu c k
Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter 
fate in your favor. W hen you make an ability check or a 
saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d 10 to 
your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but 
before any o f the roll’s effects occur.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
Fi e n d i s h  Re s i l i e n c e
Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type 
when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance 
to that damage type until you choose a different one 
with this feature. Dam age from  m agical w eapons or 
silver w eapons ignores this resistance.
Hu r l  Th r o u g h  H e l l
Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an 
attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport 
the target through the lower planes. The creature 
disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.
At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the 
space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied 
space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d 10 psychic 
damage as it reels from  its horrific experience.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest.
Th e G r e a t  O l d O n e
Your patron is a mysterious entity w hose nature is 
utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might com e from 
the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be 
one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives 
are incom prehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so 
im m ense and ancient that even the greatest libraries 
pale in com parison to the vast secrets it holds. The 
Great Old One might be unaware of your existence 
or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have 
learned allow you to draw your m agic from  it.
Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, called That 
W hich Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the 
Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu; 
and other unfathomable beings.

Ex p a n d e d  Sp e l l  List
The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list 
of spells when you learn a w arlock spell. The following 
spells are added to the w arlock spell list for you.

3rd clairvoyance, sending
4th dominate beast, Evard’ s black tentacles
5th dominate person, telekinesis
Aw a k e n e d  M in d
Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you 
the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You 
can com m unicate telepathically with any creature you 
can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share 
a language with the creature for it to understand your 
telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to 
understand at least one language.
En t r o p ic  Wa r d
At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against 
attack and to turn an enem y’s failed strike into good 
luck for yourself. W hen a creature m akes an attack 
roll against you, you can use your reaction to im pose 
disadvantage on that roll. If the attack m isses you, your 
next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you 
make it before the end of your next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
Th o u g h t  Sh ie l d
Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can’t be read by 
telepathy or other m eans unless you allow it. You also 
have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a 
creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature 
takes the sam e amount of damage that you do.
Cr e a t e  Th r a l l
At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a hum anoid’s 
mind with the alien m agic of your patron. You can use 
your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That 
creature is then charm ed by you until a remove curse  
spell is cast on it, the charm ed condition is removed 
from  it, or you use this feature again.
You can com m unicate telepathically with the charm ed 
creature as long as the two of you are on the sam e plane 
of existence.

Wizar d
Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an 
elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the 
battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving 
in front of her, she com pletes her spell and launches a 
tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts 
into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.
Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes 
an intricate m agic circle in chalk on the bare stone 
floor, then sprinkles pow dered iron along every line and 
graceful curve. W hen the circle is complete, he drones a 
long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, 
bringing a w hiff of brim stone from  the otherworldly 
plane beyond.
Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a 
gnom e tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with 
mystic symbols, muttering a few w ords of pow er over 
them. Closing his eyes to see the visions m ore clearly, 
he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points dow n the 
passage to his left.
W izards are supreme magic-users, defined and united 
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle 
weave of m agic that permeates the cosm os, wizards cast 
spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, 
and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures 
monsters from  other planes of existence, glim pses the 
future, or turns slain foes into zom bies. Their mightiest 
spells change one substance into another, call meteors 
down from  the sky, or open portals to other worlds.
Sc h o l a r s  o f t h e  A r c a n e
W ild and enigmatic, varied in form  and function, the 
pow er of m agic draws students w ho seek to master 
its mysteries. Som e aspire to becom e like the gods, 
shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical 
spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange 
words, fleeting gestures, and som etim es a pinch or 
clump o f exotic materials, these surface com ponents 
barely hint at the expertise attained after years of 
apprenticeship and countless hours of study.
W izards live and die by their spells. Everything else 
is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment 
and grow in experience. They can also learn them from 
other wizards, from  ancient tom es or inscriptions, 
and from  ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are 
steeped in magic.

Th e L u r e  o f K n o w l e d g e
W izards’ lives are seldom  mundane. The closest a 
w izard is likely to com e to an ordinary life is working 
as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching 
others the secrets of the multiverse. Other w izards sell 
their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or 
pursue lives of crim e or domination.
But the lure o f knowledge and pow er calls even the 
m ost unadventurous w izards out of the safety of their 
libraries and laboratories and into crum bling ruins and 
lost cities. M ost w izards believe that their counterparts 
in ancient civilizations knew secrets of m agic that have 
been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets 
could unlock the path to a pow er greater than any magic 
available in the present age.
Cr e a t i n g  a W i z a r d  __________
Creating a w izard character demands a backstory 
dominated by at least one extraordinary event. H ow 
did your character first com e into contact with m agic? 
H ow did you discover you had an aptitude for it? D o 
you have a natural talent, or did you simply study 
hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a 
magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the 
basics of m agic?
W hat drew you forth from  your life of study? Did your 
first taste of m agical knowledge leave you hungry for 
m ore? Have you received w ord of a secret repository 
of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? 
Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound 
m agical skills to the test in the face o f danger.Qu i c k  Bu il d
You can make a w izard quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest 
ability score, follow ed by Constitution or Dexterity.
If you plan to join the Sch ool of Enchantment, make 
Charisma your next-best score. Second, choose the sage 
background. Third, choose the mage hand, light,  and 
ray o f frost  cantrips, along with the following 1st-level 
spells for your spellbook: burning hands, charm person,  
feather fall, mage armor, magic missile,  and sleep.

Eq u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to 
the equipment granted by your background:
•  (a) a quarterstaff or ( b) a dagger
•  (a) a com ponent pouch or ( b) an arcane focus
•  (a) a scholar’s pack or ( b) an explorer’s pack
•  A  spellbook
Sp e l l c a s t i n g
A s a student o f arcane magic, you have a spellbook 
containing spells that show  the first glimm erings of 
your true power. S ee chapter 10 for the general rules of 
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.
Ca n t r i p s
At 1st level, you know  three cantrips of your choice 
from  the w izard spell list. You learn additional wizard 
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as show n in the 
Cantrips K now n colum n of the W izard table.
Yo u r  Sp e l l b o o k
The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels 
reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well 
as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature 
of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your 
adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in  
an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a  dusty tome in an 
ancient library.
Copying a Spell into the Book.  When you find a wizard spell 
of 1 st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is 
of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare 
the time to decipher and copy it.
Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing 
the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique 
system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You 
must practice the spell until you understand the sounds 
or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook 
using your own notation.
For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and 
costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you 
expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well 
as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent 
this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your 
other spells.
Replacing the Book.  You can copy a  spell from your own 
spellbook into another book— for example, if you want 
to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like 
copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, 
since you understand your own notation and already know 
how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1  hour and 10 gp 
for each level of the copied spell.
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure 
to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new 
spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook 
requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this 
reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
The Book’s Appearance.  Your spellbook is a  unique 
compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and 
margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume 
that you received as a gift from your master, a  finely bound 
gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a  
loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost 
your previous spellbook in a mishap.Sp e l l b o o k
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level 
wizard spells of your choice.
Pr e p a r i n g  a n d  Ca s t i n g  Sp e l l s
The W izard table show s how  many spell slots you have 
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of 
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level 
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots w hen you 
finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available 
for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of wizard 
spells from  your spellbook equal to your Intelligence 
modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The 
spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have 
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an 
Intelligence o f 16, your list of prepared spells can 
include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, 
chosen from  your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level 
spell magic missile,  you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 
2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from  
your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when 
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard 
spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and 
m em orizing the incantations and gestures you must 
make to cast the spell: at least 1  minute per spell level 
for each spell on your list.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Ab i l i t y
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard 
spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated 
study and mem orization. You use your Intelligence 
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Intelligence m odifier when 
setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast 
and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your intelligence modifier
Ri t u a l  Ca s t i n g
You can cast a w izard spell as a ritual if that spell has 
the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. 
You don't need to have the spell prepared.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Fo c u s
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your w izard spells.
Le a r n i n g  Sp e l l s  o f 1s t Le v e l  a n d  H i g h e r
Each time you gain a w izard level, you can add two 
w izard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each 
of these spells must be of a level for which you have 
spell slots, as shown on the W izard table. On your 
adventures, you might find other spells that you can add 
to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).

Ar c a n e  R e c o v e r y
You have learned to regain som e of your magical energy 
by studying your spellbook. O nce per day when you 
finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots 
to recover. The spell slots can have a com bined level that 
is equal to or less than half your w izard level (rounded 
up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover 
up to two levels worth o f spell slots. You can recover either 
a 2nd-level spell slot or tw o 1st-level spell slots.
Ar c a n e  T r a d i t i o n
W hen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane 
tradition, shaping your practice o f m agic through one 
of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, 
Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, 
or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the 
class description.
Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again 
at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
Ab i l i t y  Sc o r e  Im p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
Sp e l l  M a s t e r y
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over 
certain spells that you can cast them at will. C hoose a 
1st-level w izard spell and a 2nd-level w izard spell that 
are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their 
lowest level without expending a spell slot w hen you 
have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a 
higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one 
or both o f the spells you chose for different spells of 
the sam e levels.
Si g n a t u r e  Sp e l l s
W hen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two 
powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. 
Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook 
as your signature spells. You always have these spells 
prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells 
you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 
3rd level without expending a spell slot. W hen you do so, 
you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you 
must expend a spell slot as normal.
Ar can e  Tr a d itio n s
The study of w izardry is ancient, stretching back to 
the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly 
established in the worlds of D&D, with various 
traditions dedicated to its com plex study.
The m ost com m on arcane traditions in the multiverse 
revolve around the schools of m agic. W izards throughthe ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping 
them into eight categories called schools, as described 
in chapter 10. In som e places, these traditions are 
literally schools; a w izard might study at the Sch ool of 
Illusion while another studies across town at the School 
o f Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are 
m ore like academ ic departments, with rival faculties 
com peting for students and funding. Even w izards who 
train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use 
the division of magic into schools as a learning device, 
since the spells of each school require mastery of 
different techniques.
Sc h o o l  o f A b j u r a t i o n
The Sch ool of Abjuration em phasizes m agic that blocks, 
banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say 
that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than 
positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending 
harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil 
influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a 
proud and respected vocation.
Called abjurers, m em bers of this school are sought 
when baleful spirits require exorcism , when important 
locations must be guarded against magical spying, and 
when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.
Ab j u r a t i o n  Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration 
spell into your spellbook is halved.
Ar c a n e  Wa r d
Starting at 2nd level, you can weave m agic around 
yourself for protection. W hen you cast an abjuration 
spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a 
strand of the spell’s m agic to create a magical ward on 
yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward 
has hit points equal to tw ice your wizard level + your 
Intelligence modifier. W henever you take damage, the 
ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces 
the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.
W hile the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb 
damage, but its m agic remains. W henever you cast an 
abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a 
number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.
O nce you create the ward, you can't create it again 
until you finish a long rest.
Pr o j e c t e d  Wa r d
Starting at 6th level, w hen a creature that you can see 
within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your 
reaction to cause your Arcane W ard to absorb that 
damage. If this damage reduces the w ard to 0 hit points, 
the warded creature takes any remaining damage.
Im p r o v e d  Ab j u r a t i o n
Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration 
spell that requires you to make an ability check as 
a part of casting that spell (as in counterspell  and 
dispel magic),  you add your proficiency bonus to that 
ability check.

Sp e l l  Re s i s t a n c e
Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving 
throws against spells.
Furthermore, you have resistance against the 
damage of spells.
Sc h o o l  o f C o n j u r a t i o n
As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects 
and creatures out o f thin air. You can conjure billowing 
clouds of killing fog or sum m on creatures from 
elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery 
grows, you learn spells of transportation and can 
teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other 
planes of existence, in an instant.
Co n j u r a t i o n  Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell 
into your spellbook is halved.
Mi n o r  Co n j u r a t i o n
Starting at 2nd level w hen you select this school, you 
can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object 
in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space 
that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be 
no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no m ore than 
10 pounds, and its form  must be that of a nonm agicalobject that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, 
radiating dim light out to 5 feet.
The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this 
feature again, or if it takes any damage.
Be n i g n  Tr a n s p o s i t i o n
Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport 
up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. 
Alternatively, you can choose a space within range 
that is occupied by a Sm all or M edium creature. If that 
creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 
1st level or higher.
Fo c u s e d  Co n j u r a t i o n
Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on 
a conjuration spell, your concentration can’t be broken 
as a result of taking damage.
Du r a b l e  Su m m o n s
Starting at 14th level, any creature that you 
sum m on or create with a conjuration spell has 30 
temporary hit points.
Sc h o o l  o f D i v i n a t i o n  
The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and 
com m oners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding 
of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive 
to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so 
that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of 
discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, 
and foresight.
Di v i n a t i o n  Sa v a n t
Beginning w hen you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell 
into your spellbook is halved.
Po r t e n t
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, 
glim pses of the future begin to press in on your 
awareness. W hen you finish a long rest, roll two d20s 
and record the num bers rolled. You can replace any 
attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or 
a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling 
rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you 
can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.
Each foretelling roll can be used only once. W hen you 
finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
Ex p e r t  Di v i n a t i o n
Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells com es 
so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your 
spellcasting efforts. W hen you cast a divination spell 
of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one 
expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a 
level lower than the spell you cast and can’t be higher 
than 5th level.
Th e Th i r d  Ey e
Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to 
increase your pow ers o f perception. W hen you do so,

choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until 
you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. 
You can’t use the feature again until you finish a rest.
Darkvision.  You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 
feet, as described in chapter 8.
Ethereal Sight.  You can see into the Ethereal Plane 
within 60 feet of you.
Greater Comprehension.  You can read any language. 
See Invisibility.  You can see invisible creatures and 
objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.
Gr e a t e r  Po r t e n t
Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dream s 
intensify and paint a m ore accurate picture in your mind 
of what is to com e. You roll three d20s for your Portent 
feature, rather than two.
Sc h o o l  o f E n c h a n t m e n t
As a m em ber of the Sch ool of Enchantment, you have 
honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile 
other people and monsters. S om e enchanters are 
peacem akers w ho bewitch the violent to lay dow n their 
arms and charm the cruel into show ing mercy. Others 
are tyrants w ho magically bind the unwilling into their 
service. M ost enchanters fall som ewhere in between.
En c h a n t m e n t  Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment 
spell into your spellbook is halved.
Hy p n o t i c  Ga z e
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your 
soft w ords and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall 
another creature. A s an action, choose one creature that 
you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or 
hear you, it must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw 
against your wizard spell save DC or be charm ed by you 
until the end of your next turn. The charm ed creature’s 
speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and 
visibly dazed.
On subsequent turns, you can use your action to 
maintain this effect, extending its duration until the 
end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you 
move m ore than 5 feet away from  the creature, if the 
creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature 
takes damage.
Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its 
initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this 
feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.
In s t i n c t i v e  Ch a r m
Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see 
within 30 feet of you m akes an attack roll against 
you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, 
provided that another creature is within the attack’s 
range. The attacker must make a W isdom  saving throw 
against your w izard spell save DC. On a failed save, 
the attacker must target the creature that is closest 
to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures 
are closest, the attacker chooses w hich one to target.On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the 
attacker again until you finish a long rest.
You must choose to use this feature before knowing 
whether the attack hits or m isses. Creatures that can’t 
be charm ed are im mune to this effect.
Sp l i t  En c h a n t m e n t
Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment 
spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, 
you can have it target a second creature.
Al t e r  M e m o r i e s
At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature 
unaware of your m agical influence on it. W hen you cast 
an enchantment spell to charm  one or m ore creatures, 
you can alter one creature’s understanding so that it 
remains unaware of being charmed.
Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can 
use your action to try to make the chosen creature 
forget som e of the time it spent charm ed. The creature 
must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against 
your w izard spell save DC or lose a number of hours 
of its m em ories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier 
(minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less 
time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration 
of your enchantment spell.
Sc h o o l  o f Ev o c a t i o n  
You focus your study on m agic that creates powerful 
elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, 
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. 
Som e evokers find employment in military forces, 
serving as artillery to blast enemy arm ies from  afar. 
Others use their spectacular pow er to protect the weak, 
while som e seek their ow n gain as bandits, adventurers, 
or aspiring tyrants.
Ev o c a t i o n  Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell 
into your spellbook is halved.
Sc u l p t  Sp e l l s
Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of 
relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. 
W hen you cast an evocation spell that affects other 
creatures that you can see, you can choose a number 
of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen 
creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws 
against the spell, and they take no damage if they would 
normally take half damage on a successful save.
Po t e n t  Ca n t r i p
Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect 
even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. W hen 
a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your 
cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if 
any) but suffers no additional effect from  the cantrip.
Em p o w e r e d  Ev o c a t i o n
Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence 
m odifier to the damage roll of any wizard evocation 
spell you cast.

Ov e r c h a n n e l
Starting at 14th level, you can increase the pow er of 
your simpler spells. W hen you cast a w izard spell of 
5th level or lower that deals damage, you can deal 
maximum damage with that spell.
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. 
If you use this feature again before you finish a long 
rest, you take 2d 12 necrotic dam age for each level of 
the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you 
use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the 
necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d 12. This 
damage ignores resistance and immunity.
Sc h o o l  o f Il l u s i o n
You focus your studies on m agic that dazzles the 
senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the w isest 
folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by 
your keen mind make the im possible seem  real. Som e 
illusionists—including many gnom e w izards—are 
benign tricksters w ho use their spells to entertain. 
Others are m ore sinister masters of deception, using 
their illusions to frighten and fool others for their 
personal gain.
Il l u s i o n  Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell 
into your spellbook is halved.
Im p r o v e d  M i n o r  Il l u s i o n
W hen you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn 
the minor illusion  cantrip. If you already know  this 
cantrip, you learn a different w izard cantrip of yourchoice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number 
of cantrips known.
W hen you cast minor illusion,  you can create both a 
sound and an im age with a single casting o f the spell.
Ma l l e a b l e  Il l u s i o n s
Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that 
has a duration of 1  minute or longer, you can use your 
action to change the nature of that illusion (using the 
spell’s norm al parameters for the illusion), provided that 
you can see the illusion.
Il l u s o r y  Se l f
Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory 
duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual 
reaction to danger. W hen a creature m akes an attack 
roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose 
the illusory duplicate between the attacker and 
yourself. The attack automatically m isses you, then the 
illusion dissipates.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
Il l u s o r y  Re a l i t y
By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving 
shadow m agic into your illusions to give them a sem i- 
reality. W hen you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or 
higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonm agical 
object that is part of the illusion and make that object 
real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action 
while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 
1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a 
bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough 
for your allies to cross.
The object can’t deal damage or otherwise 
directly harm anyone.
Sc h o o l  o f N e c r o m a n c y
The School of N ecrom ancy explores the cosm ic forces 
of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in 
this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that 
animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to 
sap the life force from  a creature as your m agic destroys 
its body, transforming that vital energy into magical 
pow er you can manipulate.
Most people see necrom ancers as m enacing, or even 
villainous, due to the close association with death.
Not all necrom ancers are evil, but the forces they 
manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.
Ne c r o m a n c y  Sa v a n t
Beginning w hen you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy a necrom ancy 
spell into your spellbook is halved.
Gr i m  H a r v e s t
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from 
creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when 
you kill one or m ore creatures with a spell of 1st level 
or higher, you regain hit points equal to tw ice the spell’s 
level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the 
School of Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for 
killing constructs or undead.

Un d e a d  Th r a l l s
At 6th level, you add the animate dead  spell to your 
spellbook if it is not there already. W hen you cast 
animate dead,  you can target one additional corpse 
or pile of bones, creating another zom bie or skeleton, 
as appropriate.
W henever you create an undead using a necrom ancy 
spell, it has additional benefits:
•  The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an 
amount equal to your w izard level.
•  The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its 
weapon damage rolls.
In u r e d  t o Un d e a t h
Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic 
damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. 
You have spent so much time dealing with undead and 
the forces that animate them that you have becom e 
inured to som e of their worst effects.
Co m m a n d  Un d e a d
Starting at 14th level, you can use m agic to bring 
undead under your control, even those created by other 
wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that 
you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must 
make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard 
spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature 
on it again. If it fails, it becom es friendly to you and 
obeys your com m ands until you use this feature again.
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way.
If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has 
advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving 
throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can 
repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it 
succeeds and breaks free.
Sc h o o l  o f T r a n s m u t a t i o n
You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. 
To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently 
mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change.
You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both 
physical forms and mental qualities. Your m agic gives 
you the tools to becom e a smith on reality’s forge.
Som e transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, 
turning people into toads and transforming copper into 
silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their 
magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the 
pow er o f the gods to m ake and destroy worlds.
Tr a n s m u t a t i o n  Sa v a n t
Beginning w hen you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation 
spell into your spellbook is halved.
Mi n o r  Al c h e m y
Starting at 2nd level w hen you select this school, you 
can temporarily alter the physical properties of one 
nonm agical object, changing it from one substance into 
another. You perform  a special alchem ical procedure 
on one object com posed entirely of w ood, stone (but not 
a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into 
a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutesyou spend perform ing the procedure, you can transform 
up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you 
lose your concentration (as if you w ere concentrating on 
a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.
Tr a n s m u t e r ’s St o n e
Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a 
transmuter’s stone that stores transmutation magic. You 
can benefit from  the stone yourself or give it to another 
creature. A  creature gains a benefit of your choice 
as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession. 
W hen you create the stone, choose the benefit from  the 
following options:
•  Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in 
chapter 8
•  An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is 
unencum bered
•  Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
•  Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder 
damage (your choice whenever you choose this

Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level 
or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the 
stone is on your person.
If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous 
one ceases to function.
Sh a p e c h a n g e r
At 10th level, you add the polymorph  spell to your 
spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast 
polymorph  without expending a spell slot. W hen you 
do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a 
beast w hose challenge rating is 1 or lower.
O nce you cast polymorph  in this way, you can’t do so 
again until you finish a short or long rest, though you 
can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.
Ma s t e r  Tr a n s m u t e r  
Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to 
consum e the reserve of transmutation m agic stored 
within your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. W hen 
you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your 
transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade 
until you finish a long rest.
Major Transformation.  You can transmute one 
nonm agical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into 
another nonm agical object of similar size and m ass and 
of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes 
handling the object to transform it.
Panacea.  You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons 
affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s 
stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.
Restore Life.  You cast the raise dead  spell on a 
creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without 
expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in 
your spellbook.
Restore Youth.  You touch the transmuter’s stone to 
a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is 
reduced by 3 d 10 years, to a minim um of 13 years. This 
effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.

Chapter  4: P er so n ality  a n d  Backg rou n d
CH ARACTERS ARE DEFINED BY MUCH MORE THAN
their race and class. They’re individuals with 
their own stories, interests, connections, and 
capabilities beyond those that class and race 
define. This chapter expounds on the details 
that distinguish characters from  one another, 
including the basics of name and physical description, 
the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer 
points of personality and alignment.
Ch a r a c t e r  Details
Your character’s name and physical description might 
be the first things that the other players at the table 
learn about you. It’s worth thinking about how  these 
characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.
Na m e
Your character’s race description includes sample 
nam es for m em bers o f that race. Put som e thought into 
your name even if you’re just picking one from  a list.
Se x
You can play a male or female character without gaining 
any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how 
your character does or does not conform  to the broader 
culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual 
behavior. For example, a male drow  cleric defies the 
traditional gender divisions of drow  society, which could 
be a reason for your character to leave that society and 
com e to the surface.
Tik a a n d  Ar t e m is :  C o n t r a s t in g  Ch a r a c t e r s
The details in this chapter make a  big difference in setting 
your character apart from every other character. Consider the 
following two human fighters.
Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a  
brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of 
a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father’s 
trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the 
proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and 
took her under his wing, giving her a job as a  barmaid. But 
when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace 
and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure 
alongside the friends she’d known from her childhood. Her 
skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite 
weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her 
skills invaluable in her adventuring career.
Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the 
Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility 
to carve out his own territory in one of the city's hundreds 
of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the 
notice of one of the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the city, 
and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his 
youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one of the 
city’s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover 
some stolen gems. He’s a  professional killer, constantly 
challenging himself to improve his skills.
Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with 
some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high 
Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of 
sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often 
seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example, 
and som e elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s 
image. You could also play a female character w ho 
presents herself as a man, a man w ho feels trapped in a 
female body, or a bearded female dw arf w ho hates being 
mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s sexual 
orientation is for you to decide.
He i g h t  a n d  W e i g h t
You can decide your character’s height and weight, 
using the information provided in your race description 
or on the Random  Height and W eight table. Think about 
what your character’s ability scores might say about his 
or her height and weight. A w eak but agile character 
might be thin. A strong and tough character might be 
tall or just heavy.
If you want to, you can roll randomly for your 
character’s height and weight using the Random  Height 
and W eight table. The dice roll given in the Height 
M odifier colum n determines the character’s extra 
height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same 
num ber multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in 
the Weight M odifier colum n determines the character’s 
extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.
Ra n d o m  H e i g h t  a n d  W e i g h t

Human 4'8" +2d10 110 lb. x (2d4) lb.
Dwarf, hill 3'8” +2d4 115 lb. x (2d6) lb.
Dwarf, mountain 4' +2d4 130 lb. x (2d6) lb.
E lf, high 4’6" +2d10 90 lb. x (1d4) lb.
E lf, wood 4'6" +2d10 100 lb. x (1d4) lb.
E lf, drow 4'5" +2d6 75 lb. x (1d6) lb.
Halfling 2'7" +2d4 35 lb. x 1  lb.
Dragonborn 5'6" +2d8 175 lb. x (2d6) lb.
Gnome 2' 11" +2d4 35 lb. x 1  lb.
Half-elf 4'9" +2d8 110 lb. x (2d4) lb.
Half-orc 4'10" +2d10 140 lb. x (2d6) lb.
Tiefling 4'9" +2d8 110 lb. x (2d4) lb.
For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 
inches plus 2d 10 inches. Her player rolls 2 d 10 and gets 
a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then 
the player uses that sam e roll of 12 and multiplies it by 
2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 
36 pounds (12 x  3)  on top of her base 110 pounds, for a 
total of 146 pounds.
Ot h e r  Ph y s i c a l  C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s
You choose your character’s age and the color of 
his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of 
distinctiveness, you might want to give your character 
an unusual or mem orable physical characteristic, such 
as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.

Tik a a n d  Ar t e m is :  C h a r a c t e r  D e t a il s
Consider how the names T ik a W aylan and Artemis E n tre ri 
set these characters apart from each other and reflect their 
personalities. T ik a is  a  young woman determined to prove 
that she's not just a  k id  any more, and her name makes her 
sound young and ordinary. Artemis E n tre ri comes from a n  
exotic land and carries a  more mysterious name.
T ik a is nineteen years old a t the start of her adventuring 
career and has auburn h a ir, green eyes, fair sk in  w ith freckles, 
and a  mole on her right hip. Artemis is  a  sm all man, compact 
and a ll w iry muscle. He has angular features and high 
cheekbones, and he alw ays seems in  need of a  shave. H is 
raven-black h air is  thick and fu ll, but his eyes are gray and 
lifeless— betraying the emptiness of his life  and soul.
Al i g n m e n t
A  typical creature in the worlds of Du n g e o n s  & 
Dr a g o n s  has an alignment, which broadly describes 
its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a 
combination of two factors: one identifies morality 
(good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes 
attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, 
or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the 
possible combinations.
These brief sum m aries of the nine alignments 
describe the typical behavior of a creature with that 
alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from 
that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and 
consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.
Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do 
the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, 
paladins, and m ost dwarves are lawful good.
Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help 
others according to their needs. Many celestials, som e 
cloud giants, and m ost gnom es are neutral good.
Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience 
directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper 
dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.
Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance 
with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many m onks and 
som e w izards are lawful neutral.
Neutral (N) is the alignment of those w ho prefer to 
steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides,
Dw a r v i s h  Sc r i p t : Sa m p l e  Al p h a b e tdoing what seem s best at the time. Lizardfolk, most 
druids, and many humans are neutral.
Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow  their whims, 
holding their personal freedom  above all else.
Many barbarians and rogues, and som e bards, are 
chaotic neutral.
Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they 
want, within the limits o f a code of tradition, loyalty, or 
order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.
Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do 
whatever they can get away with, without com passion or 
qualms. Many drow, som e cloud giants, and yugoloths 
are neutral evil.
Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary 
violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. 
Dem ons, red dragons, and orc s are chaotic evil.
Al i g n m e n t  in t h e  M u l t iv e r s e  
For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral 
choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid 
races can choose whether to follow  the paths of good or 
evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned 
gods w ho created these races gave them free will to 
choose their moral paths, knowing that good without 
free will is slavery.
The evil deities w ho created other races, though, made 
those races to serve them. T hose races have strong 
inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. 
M ost orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc 
god, Gruumsh, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if 
an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its 
innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel 
the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)
Alignment is an essential part of the nature of 
celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be 
lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but 
rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it som ehow  
ceased to be lawful evil, it w ould cease to be a devil.
M ost creatures that lack the capacity for rational 
thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned.  
Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or 
ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. 
Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are 
not evil; they have no alignment.

La n g u a g e s  
Your race indicates the languages your character can 
speak by default, and your background might give you 
access to one or m ore additional languages o f your 
choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.
C hoose your languages from  the Standard Languages 
table, or choose one that is com m on in your campaign. 
W ith your DM ’s perm ission, you can instead choose a 
language from  the Exotic Languages table or a secret 
language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.
Som e of these languages are actually families 
of languages with many dialects. For example, the 
Prim ordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, 
and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental 
planes. Creatures that speak different dialects o f the 
sam e language can com m unicate with one another.

Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted 
and striving to help others where she can. Artemis is lawful 
evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least 
professional in his approach to murder.
As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He 
began his career as a  villain, and only cooperates with heroes 
when he must— and when it’s in his own best interests. In  
most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups 
alongside others who don’t share their interests and objectives. 
Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.
Pe r s o n a l  C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s
Fleshing out your character’s personality—the array of 
traits, mannerism s, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give 
a person a unique identity—will help you bring him 
or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of 
characteristics are presented here: personality traits, 
ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, 
think about your character’s favorite w ords or phrases, 
tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and 
whatever else you can imagine.
Each background presented later in this chapter 
includes suggested characteristics that you can use 
to spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those 
options, but they’re a good starting point.
Pe r s o n a l i t y  Tr a i t s
Give your character two personality traits. Personality 
traits are small, simple ways to help you set your 
character apart from  every other character. Your 
personality traits should tell you som ething interesting 
and fun about your character. They should be self- 
descriptions that are specific about what m akes your 
character stand out. “I’m sm art” is not a good trait, 
because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every 
book in Candlekeep” tells you som ething specific about 
your character’s interests and disposition.
Personality traits might describe the things your 
character likes, his or her past accom plishm ents, things 
your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self- 
attitude or mannerism s, or the influence o f his or her 
ability scores.
El v is h  Sc r i p t :  Sa m p l e  Al p h a b e t

Tika a n d  Ar tem is :  P e r so n a l  Ch a r a c te r istic s
Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Waylan 
dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting 
from a bad fall during her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri 
is always prepared for the worst and moves with a quick, 
precise confidence.
Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost 
childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance of 
appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves 
to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never allows 
his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges 
himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment gives 
him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power.
Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. The 
inn’s proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her 
friendship with her adventuring companions was forged 
during her time working there. Its destruction by the 
marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to 
hate them with a  fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased 
as “ I  will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for 
the destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.”
Artemis Entreri’s bond is a strange, almost paradoxical 
relationship with Drizzt Do’Urden, his equal in swordplay 
and grim determination. In  his first battle with Drizzt,
Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent, 
some indication that if his life had gone differently, he 
might have led a life more like the heroic drow’s. From that 
moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin— he is an 
antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be 
phrased as “ I  will not rest until I  have proved myself better 
than Drizzt Do’Urden.”
Each of these characters also has an important flaw.
Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger 
than her companions and annoyed that they still think 
of her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be 
tempted to act against her principles if she's convinced that 
a particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity. 
Artemis Entreri is completely walled off from any personal 
relationship and just wants to be left alone.
A useful place to start thinking about personality 
traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores 
and define one trait related to each. Either one could be 
positive or negative: you might work hard to overcom e a 
low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.
Dr a c o n i c  Sc r ip t :  Sa m p l e  Al p h a b e tId e a l s
D escribe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals 
are the things that you believe in m ost strongly, the 
fundamental moral and ethical principles that com pel you 
to act as you do. Ideals encom pass everything from  your 
life goals to your core belief system.
Ideals might answer any o f these questions: W hat are 
the principles that you will never betray? What would 
prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act 
and guides your goals and ambitions? W hat is the single 
m ost important thing you strive for?
You can choose any ideals you like, but your 
character’s alignment is a good place to start defining 
them. Each background in this chapter includes six 
suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of 
alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last 
one has m ore to do with the particular background than 
with moral or ethical perspectives.
Bo n d s
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a 
character’s connections to people, places, and events in 
the world. They tie you to things from your background. 
They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead 
you to act against your ow n best interests if they are 
threatened. They can w ork very much like ideals, 
driving a character’s motivations and goals.
Bonds might answer any of these questions: W hom  do 
you care m ost about? To what place do you feel a special 
connection? What is your most treasured possession?
Your bonds might be tied to your class, your 
background, your race, or som e other aspect of your 
character’s history or personality. You might also gain 
new bonds over the course of your adventures.
Fl a w s
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your 
character’s flaw represents som e vice, com pulsion, fear, 
or w eakness—in particular, anything that som eone 
else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to 
act against your best interests. M ore significant than 
negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any 
of these questions: W hat enrages you? W hat’s the one 
person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What 
are your vices?

In spir atio n
Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to 
reward you for playing your character in a way that’s 
true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. 
By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality 
trait of com passion for the downtrodden to give you 
an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or 
inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense 
of your hom e village to push past the effect of a spell 
that has been laid on you.
Ga i n i n g  In s p i r a t i o n
Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety 
of reasons. Typically, DM s award it w hen you play 
out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks 
presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your 
character in a com pelling way. Your DM will tell you 
how  you can earn inspiration in the game.
You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t 
stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.
Us i n g  In s p i r a t i o n
If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make 
an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending 
your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.
Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward 
another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, 
or simply doing som ething exciting in the game.
W hen another player character does som ething that 
really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting 
way, you can give up your inspiration to give that 
character inspiration.
Ba c k g r o u n d s
Every story has a beginning. Your character’s 
background reveals w here you cam e from, how  you 
becam e an adventurer, and your place in the world.
Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a 
grizzled soldier. Your w izard could have been a sage or 
an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild 
thief or com m anded audiences as a jester.
Choosing a background provides you with important 
story cues about your character’s identity. The most 
important question to ask about your background is 
what changed?  W hy did you stop doing whatever your 
background describes and start adventuring? W here 
did you get the m oney to purchase your starting gear, or, 
if you com e from  a wealthy background, why don't you 
have more  money? H ow  did you learn the skills of your 
class? W hat sets you apart from  ordinary people who 
share your background?
Tik a a n d  Ar t e m is :  B a c k g r o u n d s
T ika W aylan and Artemis E n treri both lived their earliest years 
as street urchins. Tika’s later career as a  barmaid didn’t rea lly  
change h e r, so she might choose the urchin background, 
gaining proficiency in  the Sleight of Hand and Stealth sk ills, 
and learning the tools of the thieving trade. Artemis is  more 
defined by his crim inal background, giving him  sk ills in  
Deception and Stealth, as w ell as proficiency w ith the tools of 
thievery and poison.The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide 
both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and 
languages) and roleplaying suggestions.
Pr o f ic ie n c ie s
Each background gives a character proficiency in two 
skills. Skills are described in chapter 7.
In addition, most backgrounds give a character 
proficiency with one or m ore tools. Tools and tool 
proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5.
If a character would gain the sam e proficiency from 
two different sources, he or she can choose a different 
proficiency o f the sam e kind (skill or tool) instead.
La n g u a g e s
Som e backgrounds also allow characters to learn 
additional languages beyond those given by race.
See “Languages” earlier in this chapter.
Eq u ip m e n t
Each background provides a package of starting 
equipment. If you use the optional rule from  chapter 5 
to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting 
equipment from  your background.
Su g g e s t e d  Ch a r a c t e r is t ic s
A background contains suggested personal 
characteristics based on your background. You can 
pick characteristics, roll dice to determine 
them randomly, or use the suggestions 
as inspiration for characteristics of 
your ow n creation.
Cu s t o m i z i n g  a 
Ba c k g r o u n d  
You might want to tweak 
som e of the features of a 
background so it better 
fits your character 
or the campaign 
setting. To custom ize 
a background, you can 
replace one feature 
with any other one, 
choose any two 
skills, and choose 
a total of two tool 
proficiencies or 
languages from  the 
sample backgrounds. 
You can either use 
the equipment 
package from  your 
background or spend 
coin on gear as 
described in chapter 
5. (If you spend 
coin, you can’t also 
take the equipment 
package suggested 
for your class.)
Finally, choose 
two personality

traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find 
a feature that matches your desired background, work 
with your DM to create one.
Ac o l y t e
You have spent your life in the service of a temple 
to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an 
intermediary between the realm  of the holy and the 
mortal world, perform ing sacred rites and offering 
sacrifices in order to conduct w orshipers into the 
presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a 
cleric-p erform in g  sacred rites is not the sam e thing as 
channeling divine power.
C hoose a god, a pantheon of gods, or som e other 
quasi-divine being from am ong those listed in appendix 
B or those specified by your DM, and work with your 
DM to detail the nature of your religious service.
W ere you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from 
childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or 
were you a high priest w ho suddenly experienced a call 
to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were 
the leader of a small cult outside of any established 
temple structure, or even an occult group that served a 
fiendish master that you now deny.
Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion 
Languages: Two o f your choice 
Equipment: A  holy sym bol (a gift to you w hen you 
entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer 
wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of com m on 
clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp
Fe a t u r e :  Sh e l t e r  o f t h e  Fa i t h f u l
As an acolyte, you com m and the respect of those who 
share your faith, and you can perform  the religious 
cerem onies of your deity. You and your adventuring 
com panions can expect to receive free healing and 
care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence 
of your faith, though you must provide any material 
com ponents needed for spells. T hose w ho share 
your religion will support you (but only you) at a 
m odest lifestyle.
You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated 
to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a 
residence there. This could be the temple where you 
used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a 
temple where you have found a new hom e. W hile near 
your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, 
provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and 
you remain in good standing with your temple.
Su g g e s t e d  Ch a r a c t e r is t ic s
Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples 
or other religious com m unities. Their study of the 
history and tenets of their faith and their relationships 
to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their 
m annerism s and ideals. Their flaws might be som e 
hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond 
taken to an extreme.d8 Personality Trait

You have always had a way with people. You know 
what m akes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' 
desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a 
few leading questions you can read them like they were 
children's books. It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re 
perfectly willing to use for your advantage.
You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, 
you prom ise to deliver. Com m on sense should steer 
people away from  things that sound too good to be true, 
but com m on sense seem s to be in short supply when 
you’re around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will 
surely cure that unseem ly rash, this ointment—nothing 
m ore than a bit o f fat with a sprinkle of silver dust—can 
restore youth and vigor, and there’s a bridge in the city 
that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound 
implausible, but you make them sound like the real deal.

even in a noble’s court. At such a place, you receive free 
lodging and food of a m odest or com fortable standard

As a m em ber of your guild, you know  the skills needed 
to create finished items from  raw materials (reflected in 
your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan’s tools), 
as well as the principles o f trade and good business 
practices. The question now  is whether you abandon 
your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to 
weave adventuring and trade together.
Fe a t u r e : G u i l d  M e m b e r s h i p  
As an established and respected m em ber of a guild, you 
can rely on certain benefits that m em bership provides. 
Your fellow guild m em bers will provide you with 
lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral 
if needed. In som e cities and towns, a guildhall offers a 
central place to meet other m em bers of your profession, 
which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, 
allies, or hirelings.
Guilds often wield trem endous political power. If 
you are accused of a crim e, your guild will support you 
if a good case can be made for your innocence or the 
crim e is justifiable. You can also gain access to pow erful 
political figures through the guild, if you are a mem ber 
in good standing. Such connections might require the 
donation of money or m agic items to the guild’s coffers.
You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If 
you m iss payments, you must make up back dues to 
remain in the guild’s good graces.
Su g g e s t e d  Ch a r a c t e r i s t i c s
Guild artisans are am ong the most ordinary people in 
the w orld—until they set dow n their tools and take up 
an adventuring career. They understand the value of  
hard work and the im portance of community, but they’re 
vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.
Va r i a n t  Gu i l d  Ar t i s a n : G u i l d  M e r c h a n t  
Instead of an artisans’ guild, you might belong to a 
guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You 
don’t craft items yourself but earn a living by buying 
and selling the works of others (or the raw materials 
artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might 
be a large merchant consortium  (or family) with 
interests across the region. Perhaps you transported 
goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or 
caravan, or bought them from  traveling traders and sold 
them in your own little shop. In som e ways, the traveling 
merchant’s life lends itself to adventure far m ore than 
the life of an artisan.
Rather than proficiency with artisan’s tools, you might 
be proficient with navigator’s tools or an additional 
language. And instead of artisan’s tools, you can start 
with a mule and a cart.d8 Personality Trait

You lived in seclusion—either in a sheltered community 
such as a monastery, or entirely alone—for a formative

W hat w as the reason for your isolation, and what 
changed to allow you to end your solitude? You can work 
with your DM to determine the exact nature of your 
seclusion, or you can choose or roll on the table below  to 
determine the reason behind your seclusion.Fe a t u r e :  D is c o v e r y
The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you 
access to a unique and pow erful discovery. The exact 
nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your 
seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosm os, 
the deities, the pow erful beings of the outer planes, or 
the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else 
has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has 
long been forgotten, or unearthed som e relic of the past 
that could rewrite history. It might be information that 
would be damaging to the people w ho or consigned you 
to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.
W ork with your DM to determine the details of your 
discovery and its impact on the campaign.

S om e hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, 
w hereas others chafe against it and long for company. 
W hether they em brace solitude or long to escape it, the 
solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are 
driven slightly mad by their years apart from  society.d8 Life of Seclusion

Ot h e r  He r m it s
This hermit background assum es a contemplative sort 
of seclusion that allows room  for study and prayer. If you 
want to play a rugged w ilderness recluse who lives off 
the land while shunning the com pany of other people, 
look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if 
you want to go in a m ore religious direction, the acolyte 
might be what you’re looking for. Or you could even be a 
charlatan, posing as a w ise and holy person and letting 
pious fools support you.

You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You 
carry a noble title, and your family ow ns land, collects 
taxes, and w ields significant political influence. You 
might be a pam pered aristocrat unfamiliar with 
w ork or discom fort, a form er merchant just elevated 
to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a 
disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be 
an honest, hard-working landowner w ho cares deeply 
about the people w ho live and w ork on your land, keenly 
aware of your responsibility to them.
W ork with your DM to com e up with an appropriate 
title and determine how  m uch authority that title 
carries. A  noble title doesn’t stand on its ow n—it’s 
connected to an entire family, and whatever title you 
hold, you will pass it down to your ow n children. Not 
only do you need to determine your noble title, but you 
should also work with the DM to describe your family 
and their influence on you.
Is your family old and established, or w as your title 
only recently bestow ed? H ow  much influence do they 
wield, and over what area? W hat kind of reputationdoes your family have am ong the other aristocrats of the 
region? H ow  do the com m on people regard them?
W hat’s your position in the family? Are you the heir 
to the head of the family? Have you already inherited 
the title? H ow  do you feel about that responsibility? Or 
are you so far dow n the line of inheritance that no one 
cares what you do, as long as you don’t em barrass the 
family? H ow  does the head of your family feel about 
your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good 
graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?
D oes your family have a coat o f arms? An insignia you 
might w ear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear 
all the time? An animal you regard as a sym bol of your 
line or even a spiritual m em ber of the family?
These details help establish your family and your title 
as features of the w orld of the campaign.

Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle 
than most people ever experience, and their personalities 
reflect that upbringing. A noble title com es with a 
plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other 
nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted 
to the fam ily’s care, or even to the title itself. But this 
responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.d6 Bond

Su g g e s t e d  Ch a r a c t e r is t ic s
The horrors of war com bined with the rigid discipline of 
military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping 
their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving 
them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.

You grew  up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. 
You had no one to watch over you or to provide for 
you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought 
fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other 
desperate souls w ho might steal from  you. You slept on 
rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and 
endured sickness without the advantage of m edicine or 
a place to recuperate. You’ve survived despite all odds, 
and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or som e 
com bination of each.
You begin your adventuring career with enough 
money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days. 
H ow did you com e by that money? W hat allowed you to 
break free of your desperate circum stances and embark 
on a better life?

M embers of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such 
as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold 
bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the 
coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering 
professional services for hire com m only deal in coins.
Co i n a g e  
Com m on coins com e in several different denominations 
based on the relative worth of the metal from  w hich they 
are made. The three most com m on coins are the gold 
piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt 
pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but 
not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. 
The gold piece is the standard unit of m easure for 
wealth, even if the coin itself is not com m only used. 
W hen merchants discuss deals that involve goods or 
services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, 
the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of 
individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard 
m easure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold 
bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
One gold piece is w orth ten silver pieces, the most 
prevalent coin am ong com m oners. A silver piece buys a 
laborer’s w ork for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s 
rest in a poor inn.
One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are 
com m on am ong laborers and beggars. A single copper 
piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
In addition, unusual coins made of other precious 
metals som etim es appear in treasure hoards. The 
electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate 
from  fallen em pires and lost kingdom s, and they 
som etim es arouse suspicion and skepticism w hen used 
in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver 
pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
A  standard coin w eighs about a third of an ounce, 
so fifty coins w eigh a pound.

with buyers and sellers of many sorts: 
dw arf smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling 
farmers and gnom e jewelers, not to mention 
humans of every shape, size, and color 
drawn from  a spectrum  of nations and 
cultures. In the largest cities, almost 
anything imaginable is offered for sale, from  exotic 
spices and luxurious clothing to w icker baskets and 
practical swords.
For an adventurer, the availability o f armor, weapons, 
backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount 
im portance, since proper equipment can mean the 
difference between life and death in a dungeon or the 
untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and 
exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful 
in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.
St a r t in g  Eq u ip m e n t
W hen you create your character, you receive equipment 
based on a com bination of your class and background. 
Alternatively, you can start with a num ber of gold pieces 
based on your class and spend them on items from  the 
lists in this chapter. S ee the Starting W ealth by Class 
table to determine how  much gold you have to spend.
You decide how  your character cam e by this starting 
equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods 
that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. 
You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and 
a backpack as part o f military service. You might even have 
stolen your gear. A w eapon could be a family heirloom, 
passed dow n from  generation to generation until your 
character finally took up the mantle and followed in an 
ancestor’s adventurous footsteps.

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, 
weapons, armor, and m ore in the dungeons you explore. 
Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when 
you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you 
can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.
Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.  As a general 
rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment 
fetch half their cost w hen sold in a market. W eapons 
and arm or used by m onsters are rarely in good enough 
condition to sell.
Magic Items.  Selling m agic items is problematic. 
Finding som eone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too 
hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the 
wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from  a few  com m on 
m agic items, you w on’t norm ally com e across magic 
items or spells to purchase. The value of m agic is far 
beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.
Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.  These items retain 
their full value in the marketplace, and you can either 
trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other 
transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the 
DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or 
larger com m unity first.
Trade Goods.  On the borderlands, many people 
conduct transactions through barter. Like gem s and art 
objects, trade good s—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, 
and so on—retain their full value in the market and can 
be used as currency.
Arm or  a n d  Shields
D&D w orlds are a vast tapestry made up of many 
different cultures, each with its own technology level.
For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety 
of arm or types, ranging from  leather armor to chain 
mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of 
arm or in between. The Arm or table collects the most 
com m only available types of arm or found in the game 
and separates them into three categories: light armor, 
medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors 
supplement their arm or with a shield.
Va r ia n t :  Eq u i p m e n t  Siz e s
I n  most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that 
you find on your adventures, w ithin the bounds of common 
sense. F or example, a  burly half-orc won't fit in  a  halfling’s  
leather arm or, and a  gnome would be swallowed up in  a  
cloud giant’s  elegant robe.
The DM  can impose more realism . F or example, a  suit of 
plate armor made for one human might not fit another one 
without significant alterations, and a  guard’s  uniform might 
be visibly ill-fittin g when an adventurer tries to wear it  as a  
disguise.
Using this variant, when adventurers find arm or, clothing, 
and sim ilar item s that are made to be worn, they might need 
to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherw orker, or sim ilar expert 
to m ake the item  wearable. The cost for such work varies 
from 10 to 40 percent of the m arket price of the item . The 
DM  can either ro ll 1 d4 x 10 or determine the increase in  cost 
based on the extent of the alterations required.The A rm or table show s the cost, weight, and other 
properties of the com m on types of arm or w orn in the 
worlds of D&D.
Armor Proficiency.  Anyone can put on a suit o f armor 
or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the 
arm or’s use know  how  to w ear it effectively, however. 
Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of 
armor. If you w ear arm or that you lack proficiency with, 
you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving 
throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, 
and you can’t cast spells.
Armor Class (AC).  A rm or protects its w earer from  
attacks. The arm or (and shield) you w ear determines 
your base Arm or Class.
Heavy Armor.  Heavier arm or interferes with the 
w earer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely.
If the A rm or table show s “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the 
Strength colum n for an arm or type, the arm or reduces 
the w earer’s speed by 10 feet unless the w earer has a 
Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.
Stealth.  If the Arm or table show s “Disadvantage” in 
the Stealth colum n, the w earer has disadvantage on 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Shields.  A shield is made from  w ood  or metal and 
is carried in one hand. W ielding a shield increases 
your A rm or Class by 2. You can benefit from  only one 
shield at a time.
Li g h t  A r m o r
Made from  supple and thin materials, light arm or favors 
agile adventurers since it offers som e protection without 
sacrificing mobility. If you w ear light armor, you add 
your Dexterity m odifier to the base number from  your 
arm or type to determine your A rm or Class.
Padded.  Padded arm or consists of quilted layers of 
cloth and batting.
Leather.  The breastplate and shoulder protectors of 
this arm or are made of leather that has been stiffened 
by being boiled in oil. The rest of the arm or is made of 
softer and m ore flexible materials.
Studded Leather.  Made from  tough but flexible 
leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set 
rivets or spikes.
Me d i u m  A r m o r
M edium arm or offers m ore protection than light armor, 
but it also impairs movement more. If you w ear m edium 
armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum 
of +2, to the base number from  your arm or type to 
determine your Arm or Class.
Hide.  This crude arm or consists o f thick furs and 
pelts. It is com m only w orn by barbarian tribes, evil 
humanoids, and other folk w ho lack access to the tools 
and materials needed to create better armor.
Chain Shirt.  M ade of interlocking metal rings, a chain 
shirt is w orn betw een layers o f clothing or leather. This 
arm or offers m odest protection to the w earer’s upper 
body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against 
one another to be muffled by outer layers.
Scale Mail.  This arm or consists of a coat and leggings 
(and perhaps a separate skirt) o f leather covered with

fish. The suit includes gauntlets.
B reastplate.  This arm or consists of a fitted metal 
chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves 
the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor 
provides good protection for the w earer’s vital organs 
while leaving the w earer relatively unencumbered.
H a lf P late.  H alf plate consists of shaped metal plates 
that cover m ost of the w earer’s body. It does not include 
leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached 
with leather straps.
He a v y  A r m o r
O f all the arm or categories, heavy arm or offers the best 
protection. These suits o f arm or cover the entire body 
and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only 
proficient w arriors can m anage their weight and bulk.
Heavy arm or doesn’t let you add your Dexterity 
modifier to your Arm or Class, but it also doesn’t 
penalize you if your Dexterity m odifier is negative.
R ing Mail.  This armor is leather arm or with heavy 
rings sew n into it. The rings help reinforce the armor 
against blows from  sw ords and axes. Ring mail is 
inferior to chain mail, and it's usually w orn only by those 
w ho can’t afford better armor.
Chain Mail.  Made of interlocking metal rings, chain 
mail includes a layer of quilted fabric w orn underneath 
the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of 
blows. The suit includes gauntlets.
Splint.  This arm or is made of narrow vertical strips 
of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over 
cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.
P late.  Plate consists o f shaped, interlocking metal 
plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes 
gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and 
thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles 
and straps distribute the weight over the body.

Weapons
We a p o n  P r o f i c i e n c y
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency 
with certain w eapons or categories of w eapons. The two 
categories are simple and martial. M ost people can 
use simple w eapons with proficiency. These w eapons 
include clubs, m aces, and other w eapons often found in 
the hands of com m oners. Martial w eapons, including 
swords, axes, and polearm s, require m ore specialized 
training to use effectively. M ost w arriors use martial 
w eapons because these w eapons put their fighting style 
and training to best use.
Proficiency with a w eapon allows you to add your 
proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you 
make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using 
a w eapon with w hich you lack proficiency, you do not 
add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.
We a p o n  P r o p e r t i e s
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, 
as shown in the W eapons table.
Am m unition.  You can use a w eapon that has the 
ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if 
you have ammunition to fire from  the weapon. Each 
time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece 
of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from  a quiver, 
case, or other container is part of the attack. At the 
end of the battle, you can recover half your expended 
ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.Your class grants proficiency in certain w eapons, 
reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are 
most likely to use. W hether you favor a longsw ord or 
a longbow, your w eapon and your ability to wield it 
effectively can m ean the difference between life and 
death while adventuring.
The W eapons table show s the m ost com m on weapons 
used in the worlds of D&D, their price and weight, 
the damage they deal when they hit, and any special 
properties they possess. Every weapon is classified 
as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to 
attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged  
weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property 
to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an 
improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in 
the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage 
when used in this way.
Finesse.  W hen making an attack with a finesse 
weapon, you use your choice o f your Strength or 
Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You 
must use the sam e m odifier for both rolls.
Heavy.  Sm all creatures have disadvantage on attack 
rolls with heavy w eapons. A  heavy w eapon’s size and 
bulk make it too large for a Sm all creature to use 
effectively.
Light.  A light w eapon is small and easy to handle, 
making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. 
See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.
Loading.  Because of the time required to load this 
weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition 
from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction 
to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can 
normally make.
Range.  A w eapon that can be used to make a ranged 
attack has a range show n in parentheses after the 
ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two 
numbers. The first is the w eapon’s norm al range in feet, 
and the second indicates the w eapon’s maximum range. 
W hen attacking a target beyond norm al range, you have 
disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target 
beyond the w eapon’s long range.
Reach.  This w eapon adds 5 feet to your reach when 
you attack with it.
Special.  A w eapon with the special property has 
unusual rules governing its use, explained in the 
w eapon’s description (see "Special W eapons" later in 
this section).
Thrown.  If a weapon has the thrown property, you 
can throw the w eapon to make a ranged attack. If the 
weapon is a melee weapon, you use the sam e ability 
m odifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you 
would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For 
example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, 
but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your 
Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the 
finesse property.
Two-Handed.  This w eapon requires two hands to use.
Versatile.  This weapon can be used with one or two 
hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the 
property—the damage when the w eapon is used with 
two hands to make a melee attack.
Im p r o v is e d  W e a p o n s
Som etim es characters don’t have their w eapons and 
have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An 
im provised weapon includes any object you can wield 
in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a 
frying pan, a w agon wheel, or a dead goblin.
In many cases, an im provised w eapon is similar 
to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For 
example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM ’s option, 
a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar 
object as if it w ere that weapon and use his or her 
proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resem blance to a weapon 
deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type 
appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged 
weapon to make a m elee attack, or throws a melee 
weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also 
deals 1d4 damage. An im provised thrown w eapon has a 
normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
Sil v e r e d  W e a p o n s
Som e m onsters that have immunity or resistance 
to nonm agical w eapons are susceptible to silver 
weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to 
plate their w eapons with silver. You can silver a single 
weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This 
cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the 
time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon 
without making it less effective.
Sp e c ia l  We a p o n s
W eapons with special rules are described here.
Lance.  You have disadvantage when you use a lance 
to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance 
requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.
Net.  A Large or sm aller creature hit by a net is 
restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect oncreatures that are form less, or creatures that are Huge 
or larger. A  creature can use its action to make a DC 10 
Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within 
its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the 
net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, 
ending the effect and destroying the net.
W hen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction 
to attack with a net, you can make only one attack 
regardless of the number of attacks you can 
normally make.
Ad v e n t u r in g  Gear
This section describes items that have special rules or 
require further explanation.
Acid.  As an action, you can splash the contents of 
this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw

the alchemist's fire as an im provised weapon. On a 
hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of 
each of its turns. A  creature can end this dam age by 
using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to 
extinguish the flames.
Antitoxin.  A creature that drinks this vial of liquid 
gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 
hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.
Arcane Focus.  An arcane focus is a special item— 
an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, 
a wand-like length of w ood, or som e similar item— 
designed to channel the pow er of arcane spells. A 
sorcerer, warlock, or w izard can use such an item as a 
spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10.
Ball Bearings.  A s an action, you can spill these tiny 
metal balls from  their pouch to cover a level area 10 
feet square. A creature moving across the covered area 
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall 
prone. A  creature moving through the area at half speed 
doesn’t need to make the saving throw.
Block and Tackle.  A  set of pulleys with a cable 
threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a 
block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four tim es the 
weight you can normally lift.
Book.  A book  might contain poetry, historical 
accounts, inform ation pertaining to a particular field 
of lore, diagram s and notes on gnom ish contraptions, 
or just about anything else that can be represented 
using text or pictures. A b ook  o f spells is a spellbook 
(described later in this section).
Caltrops.  As an action, you can spread a single bag 
o f caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature 
that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing 
damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, 
its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A  creature 
moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to 
make the saving throw.
Candle.  For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 
5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
Case, Crossbow Bolt.  This w ooden case can hold up 
to twenty crossbow  bolts.
Case, Map or Scroll.  This cylindrical leather case can 
hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up 
sheets of parchment.
Chain.  A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a 
successful DC 20 Strength check.
Climber’s Kit.  A clim ber’s kit includes special pitons, 
boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the 
clim ber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you 
do, you can’t fall m ore than 25 feet from  the point where 
you anchored yourself, and you can't climb m ore than 25 
feet away from  that point without undoing the anchor.
Component Pouch.  A  com ponent pouch is a small, 
watertight leather belt pouch that has compartm ents 
to hold all the material com ponents and other special 
items you need to cast your spells, except for those 
com ponents that have a specific cost (as indicated in a 
spell's description).
Crowbar.  Using a crowbar grants advantage 
to Strength checks where the crow bar’s leverage 
can be applied.Druidic Focus. A druidic focus might be a sprig of 
mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew  or 
another special w ood, a staff drawn whole out of a living 
tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, 
and teeth from  sacred animals. A druid can use such an 
object as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10.
Fishing Tackle.  This kit includes a w ooden rod, silken 
line, corkw ood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet 
lures, and narrow netting.
Healer’s Kit.  This kit is a leather pouch containing 
bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As 
an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize 
a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make 
a W isdom  (M edicine) check.
Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of 
a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a 
sym bol representing a deity, the sam e sym bol carefully 
engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny 
box holding a fragment o f a sacred relic. Appendix B 
lists the sym bols com m only associated with many gods 
in the multiverse. A  cleric or paladin can use a holy 
sym bol as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter
10. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it 
in hand, w ear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.
Holy Water.  As an action, you can splash the contents 
of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw 
it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, 
make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating 
the holy water as an im provised weapon. If the target is 
a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.
Eq u ip m e n t  Pa c k s
The starting equipment you get from your class includes a  
collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in  a  pack. 
The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are buying 
your starting equipment, you can purchase a  pack for the 
price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the item s 
individually.
Burglar’s Pack (16 gp).  Includes a  backpack, a  bag of 1,000 
b a ll bearings, 10 feet of string, a  bell, 5  candles, a  crowbar, a

candles, a  tinderbox, an alms box, 2  blocks of incense, a  
censer, vestments, 2  days of rations, and a  w aterskin.

a  bottle of in k , an in k  pen, 10 sheets of parchment, a  little  
bag of sand, and a  sm all k n ife.

A cleric or paladin may create holy water by 
perform ing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour 
to perform , uses 25 gp worth of pow dered silver, and 
requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.
Hunting Trap.  W hen you use your action to set it, 
this trap form s a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut 
when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. 
The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an im m obile 
object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. 
A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 
13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage 
and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks 
free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length 
o f the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use 
its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing 
itself or another creature within its reach on a success. 
Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the 
trapped creature.
Lamp.  A  lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius 
and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns 
for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.
Lantern, Bullseye.  A  bullseye lantern casts bright 
light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 
feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.
Lantern, Hooded.  A hooded lantern casts bright light 
in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 
feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of 
oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the 
light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.
Lock.  A key is provided with the lock. Without the 
key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick 
this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.
Your DM may decide that better locks are available 
for higher prices.Magnifying Glass.  This lens allows a closer look at 
small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint 
and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a 
magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to 
focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire 
to ignite. A  m agnifying glass grants advantage on any 
ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is 
small or highly detailed.
Manacles.  T hese metal restraints can bind a Sm all 
or M edium creature. Escaping the m anacles requires 
a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them 
requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each 
set of m anacles com es with one key. Without the key, 
a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the 
m anacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity 
check. M anacles have 15 hit points.
Mess Kit.  This tin box contains a cup and simple 
cutlery. The box clam ps together, and one side can 
be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or 
shallow bowl.
Oil. Oil usually com es in a clay flask that holds 1 
pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask 
onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 
20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack 
against a target creature or object, treating the oil as 
an im provised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered 
in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil 
dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 
fire damage from  the burning oil. You can also pour a 
flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, 
provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 
2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that 
enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature 
can take this damage only once per turn.

Spyglass.  Objects viewed through a spyglass are 
magnified to tw ice their size.
Tent.  A simple and portable canvas shelter, a 
tent sleeps two.
Tinderbox.  This small container holds flint, fire steel, 
and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to 
kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else 
with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting 
any other fire takes 1 minute.
Torch. A torch burns for 1  hour, providing bright light 
in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 
feet. If you make a m elee attack with a burning torch 
and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.Poison, Basic.  You can use the poison in this vial 
to coat one slashing or piercing w eapon or up to three 
pieces o f ammunition. Applying the poison takes 
an action. A  creature hit by the poisoned w eapon or 
ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving 
throw or take 1d4 poison damage. O nce applied, the 
poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.
Potion o f Healing. A character w ho drinks the magical 
red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking 
or administering a potion takes an action.
Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 
sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, am ong other 
things. A  com partm entalized pouch for holding spell 
com ponents is called a com ponent pouch (described 
earlier in this section).
Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.
Ram, Portable.  You can use a portable ram to break 
dow n doors. W hen doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the 
Strength check. One other character can help you use 
the ram, giving you advantage on this check.
Rations.  Rations consist of dry foods suitable 
for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, 
hardtack, and nuts.
Rope.  Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit 
points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.
Scale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small balance, 
pans, and a suitable assortm ent of weights up to 2 
pounds. W ith it, you can m easure the exact weight of 
small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade 
goods, to help determine their worth.
Spellbook.  Essential for wizards, a spellbook is 
a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages 
suitable for recording spells.Co n t a i n e r  Ca p a c i t y

To o l s
A  tool helps you to do som ething you couldn't otherwise 
do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a docum ent, or 
pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give 
you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool 
allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability 
check you m ake using that tool. Tool use is not tied to 
a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents 
broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM 
might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine 
detail with your w oodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check 
to make som ething out of particularly hard w ood.

a set of lock picks, a small m irror m ounted on a metal 
handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of 
pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your 
proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to 
disarm traps or open locks.

Mo u n t s  a n d  Vehicles
A  good mount can help you move m ore quickly through 
the w ilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the 
gear that w ould otherwise slow  you down. The Mounts 
and Other Anim als table show s each anim al’s speed and 
base carrying capacity.
An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, 
or w agon can move weight up to five times its base 
carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle.
If multiple animals pull the sam e vehicle, they can add 
their carrying capacity together.
Mounts other than those listed here are available in 
the worlds of D&D, but they are rare and not normally 
available for purchase. T hese include flying mounts 
(pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and 
even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). 
Acquiring such a mount often m eans securing an egg 
and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with 
a pow erful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.
Barding.  Barding is arm or designed to protect an 
anim al’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of 
arm or show n on the Arm or table in this chapter can 
be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the 
equivalent arm or made for humanoids, and it weighs 
tw ice as much.
Saddles.  A military saddle braces the rider, helping 
you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It 
gives you advantage on any check you make to remain 
mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any 
aquatic or flying mount.
V ehicle P roficiency.  If you have proficiency with a 
certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your 
proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that 
kind of vehicle in difficult circum stances.
R ow ed  V essels.  Keelboats and rowboats are used on 
lakes and rivers. If going downstream , add the speed of 
the current (typically 3 m iles per hour) to the speed of

the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any 
significant current, but they can be pulled upstream 
by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat w eighs 100 
pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.

Trade  Goods
M ost wealth is not in coins. It is m easured in livestock, 
grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources 
(such as a mine or a forest).
Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered 
com panies are granted rights to conduct trade along 
certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, 
or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for 
the goods or services that they control, and determine 
w ho may or may not offer those goods and services. 
Merchants com m only exchange trade goods without 
using currency. The Trade G oods table show s the value 
of com m only exchanged goods.Tr a d e  Go o d s

Expenses
W hen not descending into the depths of the earth, 
exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging w ar against 
the encroaching darkness, adventurers face m ore 
mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people 
require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, 
and clothing. These things cost money, although som e 
lifestyles cost m ore than others.
Li f e s t y l e  E x p e n s e s
Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to 
account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They 
cover your accom m odations, food and drink, and all 
your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the 
cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready 
when adventure next calls.
At the start of each w eek or month (your choice), 
choose a lifestyle from  the Expenses table and pay the 
price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per 
day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen 
lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price 
by 30. Your lifestyle might change from  one period to 
the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, 
or you might maintain the sam e lifestyle throughout 
your character’s career.
Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. 
Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make 
contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the 
risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might 
help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make 
pow erful connections.

W retched.  You live in inhumane conditions. With 
no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, 
sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying 
on the good graces of people better off than you. A 
wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, 
disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other 
wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and 
adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their 
standards. You are beneath the notice of m ost people.
Squalid.  You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut 
just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house 
in the worst part of town. You have shelter from  the 
elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent 
environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and 
misfortune. You are beneath the notice of m ost people, 
and you have few legal protections. M ost people at 
this lifestyle level have suffered som e terrible setback. 
They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer 
from  disease.
P oor.  A poor lifestyle m eans going without the 
com forts available in a stable community. Sim ple food 
and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable 
conditions result in a sufficient, though probably 
unpleasant, experience. Your accom m odations might 
be a room  in a flophouse or in the com m on room  above 
a tavern. You benefit from  som e legal protections, 
but you still have to contend with violence, crime, 
and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be 
unskilled laborers, costerm ongers, peddlers, thieves, 
m ercenaries, and other disreputable types.
M odest. A  m odest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums 
and ensures that you can maintain your equipment.
You live in an older part of town, renting a room  in a 
boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or 
thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. 
Ordinary people living m odest lifestyles include soldiers 
with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, 
and the like.C om fortable.  Choosing a com fortable lifestyle 
means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily 
maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage 
in a m iddle-class neighborhood or in a private room  
at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled 
tradespeople, and military officers.
Wealthy.  Choosing a wealthy lifestyle m eans living a 
life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the 
social status associated with the old money of nobility 
or royalty. You live a lifestyle com parable to that of a 
highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the 
royalty, or the owner of a few  small businesses. You 
have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious hom e in 
a good part of town or a com fortable suite at a fine inn. 
You likely have a small staff of servants.
A ristocra tic.  You live a life of plenty and com fort. You 
move in circles populated by the m ost powerful people 
in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps 
a townhouse in the nicest part of town or room s in the 
finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the 
most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants 
attending to your every need. You receive invitations 
to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and 
spend evenings in the com pany of politicians, guild 
leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also 
contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. 
The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will 
be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

Self-Su f f ic ie n c y
The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter assume 
that you are spending your time between adventures in town, 
availing yourself of whatever services you can afford— paying 
for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your 
sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, 
though, might prefer to spend their time away from 
civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, 
foraging, and repairing their own gear.
Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to 
spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend 
your time between adventures practicing a profession, as 
described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a  
poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at 
the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.
Se r v i c e s
Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them 
or act on their behalf in a variety o f circum stances. M ost 
such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others 
are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with 
specialized adventuring skills.
S om e of the m ost basic types of hirelings appear on 
the Services table. Other com m on hirelings include 
any o f the w ide variety o f people w ho inhabit a typical 
town or city, when the adventurers pay them to 
perform  a specific task. For example, a wizard might 
pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and 
its miniature replica) for use in the Leomund’s secret  
chest  spell. A  fighter might com m ission a blacksmith to 
forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make 
exquisite clothing for an upcom ing perform ance in 
front of the duke.
Other hirelings provide m ore expert or dangerous 
services. M ercenary soldiers paid to help the 
adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as 
are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a 
high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of som e 
kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and 
agents to run the place, from  a castellan or steward 
to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These 
hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes 
a place to live within the stronghold as part of the 
offered compensation.

Road or gate toll 1  cp
Ship’s passage 1  sp per mileSkilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform  a 
service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, 
tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. 
The pay show n is a minimum; som e expert hirelings 
require m ore pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for 
menial work that requires no particular skill and can 
include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Se r v i c e s  
People w ho are able to cast spells don’t fall into the 
category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to 
find som eone w illing to cast a spell in exchange for coin 
or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay 
rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired 
spell, the harder it is to find som eone w ho can cast it 
and the m ore it costs.
Hiring som eone to cast a relatively com m on spell 
of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds  or identify , is 
easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 
gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material 
components). Finding som eone able and w illing to 
cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a 
large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent 
temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a 
service instead of payment—the kind of service that 
only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare 
item from  a dangerous locale or traversing a monster- 
infested w ilderness to deliver som ething important to 
a distant settlement.

W hen you make your character, you can roll once on 
the Trinkets table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly 
touched by mystery. The DM might also use this table.
It can help stock a room  in a dungeon or fill a creature’s

Ch a p t e r  6: C u s t o m iz a t io n  Op t io n s
T HE COMBINATION OF ABILITY SCORES, RACE,
class, and background defines your 
character’s capabilities in the game, and 
the personal details you create set your 
character apart from every other character. 
Even within your class and race, you have 
options to fine-tune what your character 
can do. But this chapter is for players w ho—with the 
DM ’s perm ission—want to go a step further.
This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for 
custom izing your character: multiclassing and feats. 
Multiclassing lets you com bine classes together, 
and feats are special options you can choose instead 
of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels.
Your DM decides whether these options are available 
in a campaign.
Mu lt ic l a ssin g
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple 
classes. D oing so lets you m ix the abilities of those 
classes to realize a character concept that might not be 
reflected in one of the standard class options.
W ith this rule, you have the option of gaining a level 
in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead 
of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in 
all your classes are added together to determine your 
character level. For example, if you have three levels in 
wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.
As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain 
a m em ber of your original class with just a few levels 
in another class, or you might change course entirely, 
never looking back at the class you left behind. You 
might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. 
Com pared to a single-class character of the sam e level, 
you’ll sacrifice som e focus in exchange for versatility.
Mu lticl a s s i n g  Example
G ary is playing a  4th-level figh ter. When his character earns 
enough experience points to reach 5 th  level, G ary decides 
that his character w ill m ulticlass instead of continuing to 
progress as a  figh ter. Gary’s  fighter has been spending a  lot 
of time w ith Dave’s  rogue, and has even been doing some 
jobs on the side for the local thieves’  guild as a  bruiser. G ary 
decides that h is character w ill m ulticlass into the rogue class, 
and thus h is character becomes a  4th-level fighter and 1st- 
level rogue (w ritten as fighter 4/rogue 1 ).
When Gary’s  character earns enough experience to 
reach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another 
fighter level (becoming a  fighter 5/rogue 1), another rogue 
level (becoming a  fighter 4/rogue 2), or a  level in  a  third 
class, perhaps dabbling in  wizardry thanks to the tome of 
mysterious lore he acquired (becoming a  fighter 4/rogue 1/ 
wizard 1 ).Pr e r e q u i s i t e s  
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score 
prerequisites for both your current class and your new 
one, as show n in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. 
For example, a barbarian w ho decides to multiclass into 
the druid class must have both Strength and W isdom  
scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that 
a beginning character receives, you must be a quick 
study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that 
is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.
Multiclassing Prerequisites
Class Ability Score Minimum
B arbarian Strength 1 3
B ard Charisma 1 3
Cleric Wisdom 1 3
D ruid Wisdom 1 3
F ighter Strength 1 3  or Dexterity 1 3
Monk Dexterity 1 3  and Wisdom 1 3
P aladin Strength 1 3  and Charisma 1 3
Ranger Dexterity 1 3  and Wisdom 1 3
Rogue Dexterity 1 3
Sorcerer Charisma 1 3
Warlock Charisma 1 3
W izard Intelligence 1 3
Ex p e r i e n c e  P o i n t s
The experience point cost to gain a level is always 
based on your total character level, as shown in the 
Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level 
in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, 
you must gain enough X P  to reach 8th level before you 
can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh 
level as a cleric.
Hi t Po i n t s  a n d  H i t D ic e
You gain the hit points from  your new class as described 
for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a 
class only when you are a 1st-level character.
You add together the Hit D ice granted by all your 
classes to form  your p ool of Hit Dice. If the Hit D ice are 
the same die type, you can simply pool them together. 
For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a 
d 10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d 10 
Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit D ice o f different 
types, keep track o f them separately. If you are a paladin 
5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d 10 Hit D ice and 
five d8 Hit Dice.
Pr o f i c i e n c y  B o n u s
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total 
character level, as show n in the Character Advancement 
table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class.
For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the 
proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

Pr o f i c i e n c i e s
W hen you gain a level in a class other than your first, 
you gain only som e of that class’s starting proficiencies, 
as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.
Cl a s s  F e a t u r e s
W hen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features 
for that level. A few features, however, have additional 
rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra 
Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.
Ch a n n e l  Di v i n i t y
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain 
a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the 
Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting 
the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of 
it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class 
level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if 
you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity 
twice between rests because you are high enough level 
in the cleric class to have more uses. W henever you use 
the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity 
effects available to you from your two classes.
Ex t r a  At t a c k
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from  more 
than one class, the features don’t add together. You 
can’t make m ore than two attacks with this feature 
unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra 
Attack does). Similarly, the w arlock’s eldritch invocation 
Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you 
also have Extra Attack.Un a r m o r e d  De fen se
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you 
can’t gain it again from  another class.
Sp e l l c a s t in g
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your 
com bined levels in all your spellcasting classes and 
partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once 
you have the Spellcasting feature from  m ore than one 
class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the 
Spellcasting feature from  only one class, you follow  the 
rules as described in that class.
Spells Known and Prepared.  You determine 
what spells you know  and can prepare for each class 
individually, as if you were a single-classed m em ber of 
that class. If you are a ranger 4/w izard 3, for example, 
you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your 
levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know 
three w izard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten 
wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when 
you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level 
spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six 
wizard spells from your spellbook.
Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one 
o f your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability o f that 
class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting 
focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the 
spells from the class associated with that focus.
Spell Slots.  You determine your available spell slots 
by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, 
druid, sorcerer, and w izard classes, half your levels 
(rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and 
a third o f your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) 
if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster 
feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by 
consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
If you have m ore than one spellcasting class, this table 
might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than 
the spells you know  or can prepare. You can use those 
slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower- 
level spell that you cast, like burning hands,  has an 
enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you 
can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have 
any spells of that higher level.
For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ 
wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when 
determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level 
slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. 
However, you don’t know  any 3rd-level spells, nor do you 
know  any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell 
slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and 
potentially enhance their effects.
Pact Magic.  If you have both the Spellcasting class 
feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock 
class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact 
Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared 
from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you 
can use the spell slots you gain from  the Spellcasting 
class feature to cast w arlock spells you know.Mu l t i c l a s s i n g  Pr o f i c i e n c i e s

A  feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives 
a character special capabilities. It em bodies training, 
experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.
At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score 
Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you 
can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice 
instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the 
feat’s description says otherwise.
You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat 
to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, 
you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. 
For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a 
Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced 
below  13 som ehow —perhaps by a withering curse— 
you can’t benefit from  the Grappler feat until your 
Strength is restored.

Ch apter  7: U sing  Ab ility  Scores
S IX ABILITIES PROVIDE A QUICK DESCRIPTION
of every creature’s physical and mental 
characteristics:
•  Strength, m easuring physical pow er
•  Dexterity, m easuring agility
•  Constitution, measuring endurance
•  Intelligence, measuring reasoning 
and m em ory
•  Wisdom, m easuring perception and insight
•  Charisma, measuring force of personality
Is a character m uscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant 
and charm ing? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores 
define these qualities—a creature’s assets as well 
as w eaknesses.
The three main rolls of the gam e—the ability check, 
the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six 
ability scores. The book ’s introduction describes the 
basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability 
m odifier derived from  one of the six ability scores, and 
com pare the total to a target number.
This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks 
and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities 
that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls 
appear in chapter 9.
Ab il it y  Scores  a n d  
Modifiers
Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that 
defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score 
is not just a m easure of innate capabilities, but also 
encom passes a creature’s training and com petence in 
activities related to that ability.
A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but 
adventurers and many m onsters are a cut above average 
in m ost abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a 
person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores 
as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have 
scores as high as 30.
Each ability also has a modifier, derived from  the 
score and ranging from 5 (for an ability score of 1) to 
+10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and M odifiers 
table notes the ability m odifiers for the range of possible 
ability scores, from  1 to 30.

Advantage  a n d  
Disad van tag e
Som etim es a special ability or spell tells you that you 
have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, 
a saving throw, or an attack roll. W hen that happens, 
you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the 
higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use 
the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if 
you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 
5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, 
you use the 17.
If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants 
advantage or im poses disadvantage on it, you don’t roll 
m ore than one additional d20. If two favorable situations 
grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one 
additional d20.
If circum stances cause a roll to have both advantage 
and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of 
them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple 
circum stances im pose disadvantage and only one grants 
advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have 
neither advantage nor disadvantage.
W hen you have advantage or disadvantage and 
som ething in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky 
trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one 
of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a 
halfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls 
a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to 
reroll the 1.
You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through 
the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration 
(see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on 
checks related to the character’s personality, ideals, 
or bonds. The DM can also decide that circum stances 
influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant 
advantage or im pose disadvantage as a result.
Pr o fic ie n c y  Bon u s
Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by 
level, as detailed in chapter 1. M onsters also have this 
bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The 
bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving 
throws, and attack rolls.
Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die 
roll or other number m ore than once. For example, if 
two different rules say you can add your proficiency 
bonus to a W isdom  saving throw, you nevertheless add 
the bonus only once w hen you make the save.
Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be 
multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example)

before you apply it. For example, the rogue's Expertise 
feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability 
checks. If a circum stance suggests that your proficiency 
bonus applies m ore than once to the sam e roll, you still 
add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.
By the sam e token, if a feature or effect allows you 
to multiply your proficiency bonus w hen making an 
ability check that w ouldn’t normally benefit from  your 
proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the 
check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given 
the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For 
instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, 
you gain no benefit from  a feature that lets you double 
your proficiency bonus w hen you make Intelligence 
(History) checks.
In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus 
for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect 
allows you to do so, these sam e rules apply.
Ability  Checks
An ability check tests a character’s or m onster’s innate 
talent and training in an effort to overcom e a challenge. 
The DM calls for an ability check when a character or 
monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that 
has a chance of failure. W hen the outcom e is uncertain, 
the dice determine the results.
For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six 
abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty 
of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more 
difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty 
Classes table show s the most com m on DCs.
Ty p i c a l  Di f f ic u l t y  Cl a s s e s
Task Difficulty DC
Very easy 5
E asy 10
Medium 1 5
H ard 20
Very hard 25
N early impossible 30
To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the 
relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply 
bonuses and penalties, and com pare the total to the DC. 
If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check 
is a su ccess—the creature overcom es the challenge 
at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which m eans the 
character or m onster m akes no progress toward the 
objective or m akes progress com bined with a setback 
determined by the DM.
Co n t e s t s _______________________________
Som etim es one character’s or m onster’s efforts are 
directly opposed to another’s. This can occu r when both 
of them are trying to do the sam e thing and only one 
can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a m agic 
ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also 
applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other 
one from  accom plishing a goal—for example, when a 
monster tries to force open a door that an adventureris holding closed. In situations like these, the outcom e 
is determined by a special form of ability check, 
called a contest.
Both participants in a contest make ability checks 
appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate 
bonuses and penalties, but instead o f com paring the 
total to a DC, they com pare the totals of their two 
checks. The participant with the higher check total wins 
the contest. That character or monster either succeeds 
at the action or prevents the other one from  succeeding.
If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the 
same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant 
might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in 
a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character 
grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open 
a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, 
a tie m eans that the door rem ains shut.
Sk il l s
Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, 
including skills that a character or a monster can be 
proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an 
ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill 
dem onstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s 
starting skill proficiencies are determined at character  
creation, and a m onster’s skill proficiencies appear in 
the m onster’s stat block.)
For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a 
character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm 
an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of 
Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of 
Hand, and Stealth, respectively. S o  a character w ho has 
proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at 
Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.
The skills related to each ability score are show n in 
the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) 
S ee an ability’s description in the later sections o f this 
chapter for exam ples of how  to use a skill associated 
with an ability.
Som etim es, the DM might ask for an ability check 
using a specific skill—for example, “Make a W isdom  
(Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask 
the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a 
check. In either case, proficiency in a skill m eans an 
individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability 
checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the 
skill, the individual m akes a norm al ability check.Strength

For example, if a character attempts to clim b up a

Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient 
in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added 
to the Strength check. If the character lacks that 
proficiency, he or she just m akes a Strength check.
Va r i a n t : Sk i l l s  w i t h  Di f f e r e n t  Ab i l i t i e s
Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a 
specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, 
for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In som e 
situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably 
apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM 
might ask for a check using an unusual com bination of 
ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can 
apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, 
if you have to swim  from  an offshore island to the 
mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check 
to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this 
case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency 
in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. 
S o  if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your 
proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you 
would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. 
Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display 
of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might 
ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though 
Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.
Pa ssiv e  Ch e c k s
A passive check is a special kind of ability check that 
doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent 
the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as 
searching for secret doors over and over again, or can 
be used when the DM wants to secretly determine 
whether the characters succeed at som ething without 
rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.
Here’s how  to determine a character’s total for a 
passive check:
10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check
If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For 
disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive 
check total as a score.
For example, if a 1st-level character has a W isdom  of 
15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive 
W isdom  (Perception) score of 14.
The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below  
rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules 
in chapter 8.
Wo r k in g  To g e t h e r
Som etim es two or m ore characters team up to attempt a 
task. The character w ho’s leading the effort—or the one 
with the highest ability m odifier—can make an ability 
check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by 
the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help 
action (see chapter 9).
A  character can only provide help if the task is one that 
he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to 
open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so acharacter w ho lacks that proficiency can’t help another 
character in that task. Moreover, a character can help 
only when two or m ore individuals working together 
would actually be productive. Som e tasks, such as 
threading a needle, are no easier with help.
Gr o u p  Ch e c k s
W hen a number of individuals are trying to accom plish 
som ething as a group, the DM might ask for a group 
ability check. In such a situation, the characters w ho are 
skilled at a particular task help cover those w ho aren't.
To make a group ability check, everyone in the group 
m akes the ability check. If at least half the group 
succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, 
the group fails.
Group checks don’t com e up very often, and they’re 
m ost useful w hen all the characters succeed or 
fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are 
navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group 
W isdom  (Survival) check to see if the characters can 
avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural 
hazards o f the environment. If at least half the group 
succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide 
their com panions out of danger. Otherwise, the group 
stum bles into one o f these hazards.
Using  Ea c h  Ab il it y
Every task that a character or monster might attempt 
in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This 
section explains in m ore detail what those abilities 
mean and the ways they are used in the game.
St r e n g t h
Strength m easures bodily power, athletic training, and 
the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.
St r e n g t h  Ch e c k s
A Strength check can m odel any attempt to lift, push, 
pull, or break something, to force your body through a 
space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. 
The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of 
Strength checks.
Athletics.  Your Strength (Athletics) check covers 
difficult situations you encounter while climbing, 
jumping, or swim ming. Exam ples include the 
following activities:
•  You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid 
hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface 
while som ething is trying to knock you off.
•  You try to jum p an unusually long distance or pull 
off a stunt midjump.
•  You struggle to sw im  or stay afloat in treacherous cur­
rents, storm -tossed waves, or areas o f thick seaweed. 
Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwa­
ter or otherwise interfere with your swimming.
Other Strength Checks.  The DM might also call for 
a Strength check when you try to accom plish tasks like 
the following:

•  Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
•  Break free of bonds
•  Push through a tunnel that is too small
•  Hang on to a w agon while being dragged behind it
•  Tip over a statue
•  Keep a boulder from  rolling
At t a c k  Ro l l s  a n d  Da m a g e
You add your Strength m odifier to your attack roll and 
your damage roll w hen attacking with a melee weapon 
such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use 
melee w eapons to make m elee attacks in hand-to-hand 
combat, and som e of them can be thrown to make a 
ranged attack.
Li f t i n g  a n d  Ca r r y i n g
Your Strength score determ ines the amount of weight 
you can bear. The following terms define what you can 
lift or carry.
Carrying Capacity.  Your carrying capacity is your 
Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in 
pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that 
most characters don’t usually have to w orry about it.
Push, Drag, or Lift.  You can push, drag, or lift a 
weight in pounds up to tw ice your carrying capacity 
(or 30 times your Strength score). W hile pushing or 
dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, 
your speed drops to 5 feet.
Size and Strength.  Larger creatures can bear m ore 
weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For 
each size category above Medium, double the creature’s 
carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or 
lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.Dexterity m easures agility, reflexes, and balance. 
De x t e r i t y  Ch e c k s
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move 
nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling 
on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, 
and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of 
Dexterity checks.
Acrobatics.  Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers 
your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, 
such as w hen you’re trying to run across a sheet o f ice, 
balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking 
ship’s deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform  acrobatic 
stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.Va r i a n t : E n c u m b r a n c e  
The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally 
simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for m ore 
detailed rules for determining how  a character is 
hindered by the weight of equipment. W hen you use this 
variant, ignore the Strength colum n of the A rm or table 
in chapter 5.
If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength 
score, you are encumbered, which m eans your speed 
drops by 10 feet.
If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your 
Strength score, up to your m axim um  carrying capacity, 
you are instead heavily encumbered, which m eans your 
speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on 
ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use 
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
De x t e r i t y

Sleight o f Hand.  W henever you attempt an act of 
legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting 
som ething on som eone else or concealing an object on 
your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight o f Hand) check. 
The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off 
another person or slip som ething out of another 
person’s pocket.
Stealth.  Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you 
attempt to conceal yourself from  enemies, slink past 
guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on 
som eone without being seen or heard.
Other Dexterity Checks.  The DM might call for a 
Dexterity check when you try to accom plish tasks like 
the following:
•  Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
•  Steer a chariot around a tight turn
•  Pick a lock
•  Disable a trap
•  Securely tie up a prisoner
•  W riggle free of bonds
•  Play a stringed instrument
•  Craft a small or detailed object
At t a c k  Ro l l s  a n d  Da m a g e
You add your Dexterity m odifier to your attack roll and 
your damage roll w hen attacking with a ranged weapon, 
such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your 
Dexterity m odifier to your attack roll and your damage 
roll w hen attacking with a melee w eapon that has the 
finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.
Hidin g
When you try to hide, make a  Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until 
you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is 
contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature 
that actively searches for signs of your presence.
You can’t hide from a creature that can see you, and if you 
make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a 
vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can’t 
be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage 
might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet.
In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger 
all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach 
a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain 
circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay 
hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing 
you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.
Passive Perception.  When you hide, there’s a chance 
someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To 
determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM 
compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s 
passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the 
creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses 
or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For 
disadvantage, subtract 5.
For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency 
bonus o f  +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and 
proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom 
(Perception) of 14.
What Can You See?  One of the main factors in determining 
whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well 
you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily  
obscured, as explained in chapter 8.Ar m o r  Gl a s s
Depending on the arm or you wear, you might add som e 
or all of your Dexterity m odifier to your Arm or Class, 
as described in chapter 5.
In i t i a t i v e
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative 
by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines 
the order of creatures’ turns in combat, as described 
in chapter 9.
Co n s t i t u t i o n
Constitution m easures health, stamina, and vital force.
Co n s t i t u t i o n  Ch e c k s
Constitution checks are uncom m on, and no skills apply 
to Constitution checks, because the endurance this 
ability represents is largely passive rather than involving 
a specific effort on the part of a character or monster.
A Constitution check can m odel your attempt to push 
beyond normal limits, however.
The DM might call for a Constitution check when you 
try to accom plish tasks like the following:
•  Hold your breath
•  M arch or labor for hours without rest
•  Go without sleep
•  Survive without food or water
•  Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go
Hi t Po i n t s
Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit 
points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to 
each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.
If your Constitution m odifier changes, your hit point 
maximum changes as well, as though you had the new 
modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your 
Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your 
Constitution m odifier increases from  +1 to +2, you 
adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier 
had always been +2. S o you add 3 hit points for your 
first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th 
level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and 
som e effect low ers your Constitution score so as to 
reduce your Constitution m odifier by 1, your hit point 
m aximum is reduced by 7.
In t e l l i g e n c e
Intelligence m easures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, 
and the ability to reason.
In t e l l i g e n c e  Ch e c k s
An Intelligence check com es into play when you need 
to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive 
reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, 
and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of 
Intelligence checks.
Arcana.  Your Intelligence (Arcana) check m easures 
your ability to recall lore about spells, m agic items, 
eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of 
existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.
History.  Your Intelligence (History) check m easures 
your ability to recall lore about historical events,

legendary people, ancient kingdom s, past disputes, 
recent wars, and lost civilizations.
Investigation.  W hen you look around for clues and 
make deductions based on those clues, you make an 
Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the 
location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance 
o f a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine 
the w eakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to 
collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of 
a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an 
Intelligence (Investigation) check.
Nature.  Your Intelligence (Nature) check m easures 
your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and 
animals, the weather, and natural cycles.
Religion.  Your Intelligence (Religion) check m easures 
your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, 
religious hierarchies, holy sym bols, and the practices 
of secret cults.
Other Intelligence Checks.  The DM might call for an 
Intelligence check when you try to accom plish tasks like 
the following:
•  Com municate with a creature without using w ords
•  Estimate the value of a precious item
•  Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
•  Forge a docum ent
•  Recall lore about a craft or trade
•  W in a game of skill
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Ab i l i t y
W izards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, 
which helps determine the saving throw D Cs of 
spells they cast.
Wis d o m
W isdom  reflects how attuned you are to the world 
around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.
Wi s d o m  Ch e c k s
A W isdom  check might reflect an effort to read body 
language, understand som eone’s feelings, notice things 
about the environment, or care for an injured person. 
The Anim al Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, 
and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of 
W isdom  checks.
Animal Handling.  W hen there is any question 
whether you can calm  down a dom esticated animal, 
keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s 
intentions, the DM might call for a W isdom  (Animal 
Handling) check. You also make a W isdom  (Animal 
Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt 
a risky maneuver.
Insight.  Your W isdom  (Insight) check decides whether 
you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such 
as w hen searching out a lie or predicting som eone’s 
next move. D oing so involves gleaning clues from  body 
language, speech habits, and changes in mannerism s.
Medicine.  A W isdom  (M edicine) check lets you try to 
stabilize a dying com panion or diagnose an illness.
Perception.  Your W isdom  (Perception) check lets 
you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of 
something. It m easures your general awareness of 
your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.Fin d in g  a H id d e n  O b je c t
When your character searches for a hidden object such as 
a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a  
Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find 
hidden details or other information and clues that you might 
otherwise overlook.
In  most cases, you need to describe where you are looking 
in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For 
example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in 
the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace 
around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, 
you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your 
Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify 
that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in 
order to have any chance of success.
For example, you might try to hear a conversation 
through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, 
or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you 
might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to 
miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, 
thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight 
under a closed secret door.
Survival.  The DM might ask you to make a W isdom  
(Survival) check to follow  tracks, hunt wild game, guide 
your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs 
that ow lbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid 
quicksand and other natural hazards.
Other Wisdom Checks.  The DM might call for a 
W isdom  check when you try to accom plish tasks like 
the following:
•  Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
•  D iscern whether a seem ingly dead or living creature 
is undead
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Ab i l i t y
Clerics, druids, and rangers use W isdom  as their 
spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving 
throw DCs of spells they cast.
Ch a r is m a
Charisma m easures your ability to interact effectively 
with others. It includes such factors as confidence 
and eloquence, and it can represent a charm ing or 
com m anding personality.
Ch a r i s m a  Ch e c k s
A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence 
or entertain others, when you try to make an im pression 
or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a 
tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, 
Perform ance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in 
certain kinds of Charisma checks.
Deception.  Your Charisma (D eception) check 
determines whether you can convincingly hide the 
truth, either verbally or through your actions. This 
deception can encom pass everything from  misleading 
others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical 
situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a 
merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself 
off in a disguise, dull som eone’s suspicions with false 
assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling 
a blatant lie.

Intimidation.  W hen you attempt to influence som eone 
through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical 
violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma 
(Intimidation) check. Exam ples include trying to pry 
information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs 
to back dow n from  a confrontation, or using the edge of 
a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to 
reconsider a decision.
Performance.  Your Charisma (Perform ance) check 
determines how  well you can delight an audience with 
music, dance, acting, storytelling, or som e other form  of 
entertainment.
Persuasion.  W hen you attempt to influence som eone 
or a group o f people with tact, social graces, or good 
nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma 
(Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when 
acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial 
requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Exam ples of 
persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to 
let your party see the king, negotiating peace between 
warring tribes, or inspiring a crow d of townsfolk.
Other Charisma Checks.  The DM might call for a 
Charisma check when you try to accom plish tasks like 
the following:
•  Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, 
and gossip
•  Blend into a crow d to get the sense o f key topics 
o f conversation
Sp e l l c a s t i n g  Ab i l i t y
Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and w arlocks use Charisma 
as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the 
saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
Sa v in g  Th row s
A  saving throw—also called a save—represents an 
attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or 
a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a 
saving throw; you are forced to make one because your 
character or monster is at risk o f harm.
To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the 
appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your 
Dexterity m odifier for a Dexterity saving throw.
A saving throw can be modified by a situational 
bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage 
and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.
Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving 
throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient 
in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, 
proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his 
or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using 
a particular ability score. Som e monsters have saving 
throw proficiencies as well.
The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined 
by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a 
saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the 
caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.
The result of a successful or failed saving throw is 
also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, 
a successful save m eans that a creature suffers no 
harm, or reduced harm, from  an effect.

Ch apter  8: A d ven tu r in g
D ELVING INTO THE ANCIENT TOMB OF HORRORS.
slipping through the back alleys of 
W aterdeep, hacking a fresh trail through 
the thick jungles on the Isle of D read—these 
are the things that Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  
adventures are made of. Your character in 
the game might explore forgotten ruins and 
uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister 
plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your 
character will survive to claim rich rewards before 
embarking on a new adventure.
This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, 
from  the m echanics of movement to the com plexities of 
social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this 
chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your 
character might pursue between adventures.
W hether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon 
or the com plex relationships of a royal court, the game 
follow s a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book ’s 
introduction:
1. The DM describes the environment.
2. The players describe what they want to do.
3. The DM narrates the results of their actions.
Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the 
adventure, tracking the characters’ progress as they 
explore dungeon corridors or w ilderness regions.
The D M ’s notes, including a key to the map, describe 
what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. 
Som etim es, the passage of time and the adventurers’ 
actions determine what happens, so the DM might 
use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress 
instead of a map.
Tim e
In situations w here keeping track of the passage of 
time is important, the DM determines the time a task 
requires. The DM might use a different time scale 
depending on the context of the situation at hand. In 
a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement 
happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a 
minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute 
to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and 
a good ten minutes to search the cham ber beyond for 
anything interesting or valuable.
In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more 
appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower 
at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles 
in just under four hours’ time.
For long journeys, a scale of days w orks best. 
Following the road from  Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the 
adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin 
am bush interrupts their journey.
In com bat and other fast-paced situations, the game 
relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described 
in chapter 9.Mo v e m e n t
Sw im m ing across a rushing river, sneaking dow n a 
dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain s lo p e - 
all sorts of movement play a key role in D&D adventures.
The DM can sum m arize the adventurers’ movement 
without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You 
travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance 
late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, 
particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the 
DM can sum m arize movement between encounters: 
“After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient 
dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads 
you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm 
bridged by a narrow stone arch.”
Som etim es it’s important, though, to know how  long 
it takes to get from  one spot to another, whether the 
answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for 
determining travel time depend on two factors: the 
speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the 
terrain they're moving over.
Speed
Every character and monster has a speed, which is 
the distance in feet that the character or monster 
can walk in 1  round. This number assum es short 
bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life- 
threatening situation.
The following rules determine how  far a character 
or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.
Tr a v e l  Pa c e
W hile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a 
normal, fast, or slow  pace, as shown on the Travel Pace 
table. The table states how  far the party can move in a 
period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A 
fast pace m akes characters less perceptive, w hile a slow  
pace m akes it possible to sneak around and to search an 
area m ore carefully (see the “Activity W hile Traveling” 
section later in this chapter for m ore information).
Forced March.  The Travel Pace table assum es that 
characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on 
beyond that limit, at the risk o f exhaustion.
For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, 
the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour 
colum n for their pace, and each character must make 
a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The 
DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed 
saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion 
(see appendix A).
Mounts and Vehicles.  For short spans of time (up 
to an hour), many animals move much faster than 
humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop 
for about an hour, covering tw ice the usual distance for 
a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 
miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, 
but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land 
vehicles ch oose a pace as normal. Characters in a 
waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel 
(see chapter 5), and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast 
pace or gain benefits from  a slow  pace. Depending on 
the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able 
to travel for up to 24 hours per day.
Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, 
or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying,  allow you 
to travel m ore swiftly. The Dungeon Master’ s Guide  
contains m ore information on special m ethods of travel.
Dif f ic u l t  Te r r a in
The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table 
assum e relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, 
or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face 
dense forests, deep swam ps, rubble-filled ruins, steep 
mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered 
difficult terrain.
You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 
1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you 
can cover only half the norm al distance in a minute, 
an hour, or a day.
Sp e c i a l  Ty p e s  o f M o v e m e n t
Movement through dangerous dungeons or w ilderness 
areas often involves m ore than simply walking. 
Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jum p 
to get where they need to go.
Cl i m b i n g ,  Sw i m m i n g ,  a n d  Cr a w l in g
W hile clim bing or swim ming, each foot of movement 
costs 1  extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless 
a creature has a clim bing or sw im m ing speed. At the 
DM ’s option, clim bing a slippery vertical surface or 
one with few handholds requires a successful Strength 
(Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in 
rough water might require a successful Strength 
(Athletics) check.
Ju m p in g
Your Strength determ ines how  far you can jump.
Long Jump.  W hen you m ake a long jump, you cover a 
number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at 
least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. W hen 
you m ake a standing long jump, you can leap only half 
that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the 
jum p costs a foot of movement.
This rule assum es that the height of your jum p 
doesn’t matter, such as a jum p across a stream or 
chasm. At your DM ’s option, you must succeed on aDC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle 
(no taller than a quarter of the jum p’s distance), such as 
a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.
W hen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed 
on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your 
feet. Otherwise, you land prone.
High Jump.  W hen you make a high jump, you leap 
into the air a num ber of feet equal to 3 + your Strength 
m odifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately 
before the jump. W hen you make a standing high jump, 
you can jum p only half that distance. Either way, each 
foot you clear on the jum p costs a foot o f movement. In 
som e circum stances, your DM might allow you to make 
a Strength (Athletics) check to jum p higher than you 
normally can.
You can extend your arms half your height above 
yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above 
you a distance equal to the height of the jum p plus 1  1 /2  
times your height.
Ac t i v i t y  W h i l e  T r a v e l i n g
As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the 
wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and 
som e characters might perform  other tasks to help 
the group’s journey.
Ma r c h i n g  O r d e r
The adventurers should establish a m arching order.
A m arching order m akes it easier to determine which 
characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot 
hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those 
enem ies when a fight breaks out.
A character might occupy the front rank, one or m ore 
m iddle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front 
and back ranks need enough room  to travel side by 
side with others in their rank. W hen space is too tight, 
the marching order must change, usually by m oving 
characters to a middle rank.
Fewer Than Three Ranks.  If an adventuring party 
arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they 
are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, 
it’s considered a front rank.
St e a l t h
W hile traveling at a slow  pace, the characters can move 
stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try 
to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. 
S ee the rules for hiding in chapter 7.
No t i c i n g  Th r e a t s
Use the passive W isdom  (Perception) scores of the 
characters to determine whether anyone in the group 
notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a 
threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular 
rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a 
maze o f tunnels, the DM might decide that only those 
characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or 
spot a stealthy creature follow ing the group, while 
characters in the front and middle ranks cannot.
W hile traveling at a fast pace, characters take a - 5  
penalty to their passive W isdom  (Perception) scores 
to notice hidden threats.Tr a v e l  Pa c e

Encountering Creatures.  If the DM determines 
that the adventurers encounter other creatures while 
they’re traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what 
happens next. Either group might decide to attack, 
initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the 
other group does.
Surprising Foes.  If the adventurers encounter a 
hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether 
the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when 
com bat erupts. S ee chapter 9 for m ore about surprise.
Ot h e r  Ac t i v i t i e s
Characters w ho turn their attention to other tasks as the 
group travels are not focused on watching for danger. 
T hese characters don’t contribute their passive W isdom  
(Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing 
hidden threats. However, a character not watching for 
danger can do one of the following activities instead, or 
som e other activity with the D M ’s perm ission.
Navigate.  The character can try to prevent the group 
from  becom ing lost, m aking a W isdom  (Survival) check 
when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide  
has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)
Draw a Map.  The character can draw a map 
that records the group’s progress and helps the 
characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability 
check is required.
Track.  A  character can follow  the tracks of another 
creature, m aking a W isdom  (Survival) check when the 
DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’ s Guide  has rules 
for tracking.)
Forage.  The character can keep an eye out for ready 
sources of food and water, making a W isdom  (Survival) 
check w hen the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’ s  
Guide  has rules for foraging.)
The En v ir o n m e n t
By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places 
that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be 
explored. The rules in this section cover som e of the 
m ost important ways in w hich adventurers interact with 
the environment in such places. The Dungeon Master’s  
Guide  has rules covering m ore unusual situations.
Fa l l i n g
A  fall from  a great height is one of the m ost com m on 
hazards facing an adventurer.
At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning 
damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. 
The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking 
damage from  the fall.
Su f f o c a t i n g
A  creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes 
equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 
of 30 seconds).
W hen a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for 
a number o f rounds equal to its Constitution modifier 
(minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops 
to 0 hit points and is dying.Sp l it t in g  U p t h e  Pa r t y
Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, 
especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead. 
You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. 
Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks.
The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split 
into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The 
advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving 
slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier 
characters would alert. A rogue and a  monk moving at a slow 
pace are much harder to detect when they leave their dwarf 
paladin friend behind.
For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can 
hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it 
has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.
Vi s i o n  a n d  L i g h t
The m ost fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing 
danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in 
combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few— 
rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness 
and other effects that obscure vision can prove a 
significant hindrance.
A  given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In 
a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, 
or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on 
W isdom  (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque 
fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A  creature 
in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from  the 
blinded condition (see appendix A).
The presence or absence of light in an environment 
creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim 
light, and darkness.
Bright light lets m ost creatures see normally. Even 
gloom y days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, 
fires, and other sources of illumination within a 
specific radius.
Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly 
obscured area. An area o f dim light is usually a 
boundary between a source of bright light, such as 
a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light 
of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A 
particularly brilliant full m oon might bathe the land 
in dim light.
Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters 
face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit 
nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a 
subterranean vault, or in an area of m agical darkness.
Bl i n d s i g h t
A  creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings 
without relying on sight, within a specific radius. 
Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures 
with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats 
and true dragons, have this sense.
Da r k v i s i o n
Many creatures in the w orlds o f D&D, especially those 
that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a 
specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in

darkness as if the darkness w ere dim light, so areas 
of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that 
creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t 
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Tr u e s i g h t
A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, 
see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible 
creatures and objects, automatically detect visual 
illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, 
and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or 
a creature that is transformed by m agic. Furthermore, 
the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.
Fo o d  a n d  W a t e r
Characters w ho don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of 
exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack 
of food or water can’t be removed until the character 
eats and drinks the full required amount.
Fo o d
A  character needs one pound of food per day and can 
m ake food last longer by subsisting on half rations. 
Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day 
without food.
A character can go without food for a number of days 
equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 
1). At the end o f each day beyond that limit, a character 
automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.
A  norm al day o f eating resets the count of days 
without food to zero.
Wa t e r
A  character needs one gallon of water per day, or two 
gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who 
drinks only half that much water must succeed on a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of 
exhaustion at the end of the day. A  character with access 
to even less water automatically suffers one level of 
exhaustion at the end o f the day.
If the character already has one or m ore levels of 
exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.
In t e r a c t i n g  w i t h  O b j e c t s
A character’s interaction with objects in an environment 
is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells 
the DM that his or her character is doing something, 
such a moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if 
anything happens.
For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, 
w hich might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room  to 
flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. 
If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character 
might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might 
call for a Strength check to see whether the character 
can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for 
any such check based on the difficulty of the task.
Characters can also damage objects with their 
w eapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and 
psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected 
by physical and magical attacks much like creaturescan. The DM determines an object’s A rm or Class and 
hit points, and might decide that certain objects have 
resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s 
hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects 
always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and 
they are immune to effects that require other saves. 
W hen an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.
A  character can also attempt a Strength check to 
break an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.
So c ia l  In t e r a c t io n
Exploring dungeons, overcom ing obstacles, and slaying 
m onsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less 
important, though, are the social interactions that 
adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.
Interaction takes on many forms. You might need 
to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to som e 
m alfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that 
it w ill spare your life. The DM assum es the roles of any 
characters w ho are participating in the interaction that 
don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such 
character is called a nonplayer character (NPC).
In general terms, an N P C ’s attitude toward you is 
described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly 
NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are 
inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you 
want from  a friendly NPC, o f course.
Social interactions have two primary aspects: 
roleplaying and ability checks.
Ro l e p l a y i n g
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role.
In this case, it’s you as a player determining how  your 
character thinks, acts, and talks.
Roleplaying is a part of every aspect o f the game, 
and it com es to the fore during social interactions.
Your character’s quirks, mannerism s, and personality 
influence how  interactions resolve.
There are two styles you can use w hen roleplaying 
your character: the descriptive approach and the active 
approach. Most players use a com bination of the two 
styles. Use whichever m ix of the two w orks best for you.
De s c r i p t i v e  Ap p r o a c h  t o Ro l e p l a y i n g  
W ith this approach, you describe your character’s w ords 
and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on 
your mental im age of your character, you tell everyone 
what your character does and how  he or she does it.
For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek 
has a quick tem per and blam es the elves of the 
Cloakw ood for his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an 
obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to 
strike up a conversation with the dwarf.
Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an 
insult at the bard, and stom ps over to the bar. He sits 
on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering 
another drink.”
In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s m ood 
and given the DM a clear idea of his character’s 
attitude and actions.

W hen using descriptive roleplaying, keep the 
following things in mind:
•  D escribe your character’s em otions and attitude.
•  Focus on your character’s intent and how  others 
might perceive it.
•  Provide as much embellishment as you feel 
com fortable with.
D on’t w orry about getting things exactly right. Just 
focus on thinking about what your character would do 
and describing what you see in your mind.
Ac t i v e  Ap p r o a c h  t o Ro l e p l a y i n g
If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow 
players what your character thinks and does, active 
roleplaying shows  them.
W hen you use active roleplaying, you speak with your 
character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might 
even echo your character’s movements and body language. 
This approach is m ore im mersive than descriptive 
roleplaying, though you still need to describe things 
that can’t be reasonably acted out.
Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek 
above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used 
active roleplaying:
Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, 
“I w as w ondering why it suddenly sm elled awful in here. 
If I wanted to hear anything out o f you, I'd snap your 
arm and enjoy your scream s.” In his norm al voice, Chris 
then adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”
Re s u l t s  o f Ro l e p l a y i n g  
The DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to 
determine how  an NPC reacts. A cowardly N PC buckles 
under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to 
let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.
W hen interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to 
the DM ’s portrayal o f the N P C ’s m ood, dialogue, and 
personality. You might be able to determine an N P C ’s 
personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on 
them to influence the N P C ’s attitude.
Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in 
real life. If you can offer N PCs som ething they want, 
threaten them with som ething they fear, or play on their 
sympathies and goals, you can use w ords to get almost 
anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a 
proud w arrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts 
to convince or deceive will fall short.
Ab i l i t y  C h e c k s
In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in 
determining the outcom e of an interaction.
Your roleplaying efforts can alter an N P C ’s attitude, 
but there might still be an element of chance in the 
situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma 
check at any point during an interaction if he or she 
wants the dice to play a role in determining an N P C ’s 
reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain 
situations, at your DM ’s discretion.
Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking 
of how  you want to interact with an NPC, and stack 
the deck in your favor by using an approach that relieson your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to 
trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue 
w ho is proficient in D eception is the best bet to lead the 
discussion. W hen negotiating for a hostage’s release, 
the cleric with Persuasion should do most of the talking.
Resting
H eroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend 
every hour o f the day in the thick of exploration, social 
interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to 
sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds 
and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for 
further adventure.
Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an 
adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.
Sh o r t  R e s t
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, 
during which a character does nothing m ore strenuous 
than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.
A  character can spend one or m ore Hit D ice at the end 
of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number 
of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For 
each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die 
and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The 
character regains hit points equal to the total. The player 
can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. 
A  character regains som e spent Hit D ice upon finishing 
a long rest, as explained below.
Lo n g  R e s t
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 
hours long, during w hich a character sleeps or perform s 
light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch 
for no m ore than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a 
period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, 
fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity— 
the characters must begin the rest again to gain any 
benefit from  it.
At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost 
hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up 
to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total 
number of them. For example, if a character has eight 
Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit D ice upon 
finishing a long rest.
A  character can’t benefit from  m ore than one long rest 
in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 
1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
Be tw e e n  Ad v e n tu r e s
Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient 
evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and 
prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also 
use this time to perform  other tasks, such as crafting 
arms and armor, perform ing research, or spending 
their hard-earned gold.
In som e cases, the passage o f time is som ething that 
occu rs with little fanfare or description. W hen starting 
a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a 
certain amount of time has passed and allow you to

describe in general terms what your character has 
been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep 
track of just how  much time is passing as events beyond 
your perception stay in motion.
Li f e s t y l e  E x p e n s e s
Between adventures, you choose a particular quality 
of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as 
described in chapter 5.
Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect 
on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way 
other individuals and groups react to you. For example, 
w hen you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier 
for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you 
live in poverty.
Do w n t i m e  A c t i v i t i e s
Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your 
character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods 
of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime 
activity requires a certain number of days to complete 
before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each 
day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day 
to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you 
have m ore than the minim um  amount of days to spend, 
you can keep doing the sam e thing for a longer period 
of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.
Downtim e activities other than the ones presented 
below  are possible. If you want your character to spend 
his or her downtime perform ing an activity not covered 
here, discuss it with your DM.
Cr a f t i n g
You can craft nonm agical objects, including adventuring 
equipment and w orks of art. You must be proficient 
with tools related to the object you are trying to create 
(typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to 
special materials or locations necessary to create it. For 
example, som eone proficient with smith’s tools needs a 
forge in order to craft a sw ord or suit of armor.
For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you 
can craft one or m ore items with a total market value 
not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials 
w orth half the total market value. If som ething you 
want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you 
make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you 
reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit 
of plate arm or (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days 
to craft by yourself.
Multiple characters can com bine their efforts toward 
the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters 
all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are 
w orking together in the sam e place. Each character 
contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent 
helping to craft the item. For example, three characters 
with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper 
facilities can craft a suit o f plate arm or in 100 days, 
at a total cost o f 750 gp.
W hile crafting, you can maintain a m odest lifestyle 
without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable 
lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more 
information on lifestyle expenses).Pr a c t i c i n g  a Pr o f e s s i o n
You can w ork between adventures, allowing you to 
maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp 
per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle 
expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to 
practice your profession.
If you are a m em ber of an organization that can 
provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a 
thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a com fortable 
lifestyle instead.
If you have proficiency in the Perform ance skill and 
put your perform ance skill to use during your downtime, 
you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.
Re c u p e r a t i n g
You can use downtime between adventures to recover 
from  a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.
After three days of downtime spent recuperating, 
you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.
On a successful save, you can choose one of the 
following results:
•  End one effect on you that prevents you from  regain­
ing hit points.
•  For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving 
throws against one disease or poison currently 
affecting you.
Re s e a r c h i n g
The time between adventures is a great chance to 
perform  research, gaining insight into mysteries 
that have unfurled over the course o f the campaign. 
Research can include poring over dusty tom es and 
crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the 
locals to pry rum ors and gossip from  their lips.
W hen you begin your research, the DM determines 
whether the information is available, how  many days of 
downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are 
any restrictions on your research (such as needing to 
seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The 
DM might also require you to m ake one or m ore ability 
checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check 
to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, 
or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure som eone’s 
aid. O nce those conditions are met, you learn the 
inform ation if it is available.
For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to 
cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your 
norm al lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).
Tr a i n i n g
You can spend time between adventures learning a new 
language or training with a set of tools. Your DM might 
allow additional training options.
First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. 
The DM determines how  long it takes, and whether one 
or m ore ability checks are required.
The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. 
After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, 
you learn the new language or gain proficiency with 
the new tool.

Ch apter  9: C om bat
T HE CLATTER OF A SWORD STRIKING AGAINST
a shield. The terrible rending sound as 
m onstrous claws tear through armor. A 
brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame 
blossom s from  a w izard’s spell. The sharp 
tang of blood in the air, cutting through 
the stench of vile monsters. Roars of fury, 
shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in D&D can be 
chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.
This chapter provides the rules you need for your 
characters and m onsters to engage in combat, whether 
it is a brief skirm ish or an extended conflict in a 
dungeon or on a field o f battle. Throughout this chapter, 
the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master. 
The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and 
nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other 
player controls an adventurer. “You” can also mean the 
character or monster that you control.
The Order  of Co m b a t
A typical com bat encounter is a clash between two 
sides, a flurry of w eapon swings, feints, parries, 
footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the 
chaos of com bat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A 
round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. 
During a round, each participant in a battle takes a 
turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning 
of a com bat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. 
O nce everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to 
the next round if neither side has defeated the other.
Su r p r i s e
A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, 
springing from  the trees to attack them. A  gelatinous 
cube glides dow n a dungeon passage, unnoticed by 
the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In 
these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise 
over the other.
The DM determ ines w ho might be surprised. If 
neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice 
each other. Otherwise, the DM com pares the Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive 
W isdom  (Perception) score of each creature on the
Co m b a t  St e p  by St e p
1. Determine surprise. The DM determines whether anyone 
involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
2. Establish positions. The DM decides where all the 
characters and monsters are located. Given the 
adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in  
the room or other location, the DM figures out where the 
adversaries are— how far away and in what direction.
3. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter 
rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.
4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in 
initiative order.
5. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the 
combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until 
the fighting stops.opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t 
notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.
If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action 
on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a 
reaction until that turn ends. A  m em ber of a group can 
be surprised even if the other m em bers aren’t.
In i t i a t i v e
Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. 
W hen com bat starts, every participant m akes a 
Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative 
order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of 
identical creatures, so each m em ber of the group acts at 
the sam e time.
The DM ranks the combatants in order from  the one 
with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with 
the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) 
in which they act during each round. The initiative order 
remains the sam e from  round to round.
If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order am ong 
tied DM -controlled creatures, and the players decide 
the order am ong their tied characters. The DM can 
decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a 
player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied 
characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine 
the order, highest roll going first.
Yo u r  Tu r n
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed 
and take one action. You decide whether to move first 
or take your action first. Your speed—som etim es called 
your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.
The most com m on actions you can take are described 
in the “Actions in Com bat” section later in this chapter. 
Many class features and other abilities provide 
additional options for your action.
The “Movement and Position” section later in this 
chapter gives the rules for your move.
You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing 
anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to 
do on your turn, consider taking the D odge or Ready 
action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”
Bo n u s  Ac t i o n s
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you 
take an additional action on your turn called a bonus 
action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows 
a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus 
action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature 
of the game states that you can do som ething as a bonus 
action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.
You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so 
you must choose which bonus action to use w hen you 
have m ore than one available.
You choose when to take a bonus action during your 
turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and 
anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions 
also prevents you from  taking a bonus action.

Ot h e r  Ac t i v i t y  o n Yo u r  Tu r n
Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require 
neither your action nor your move.
You can com m unicate however you are able, through 
brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.
You can also interact with one object or feature of the 
environment for free, during either your move or your 
action. For example, you could open a door during your 
move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your 
weapon as part of the sam e action you use to attack.
If you want to interact with a second object, you need 
to use your action. S om e m agic items and other special 
objects always require an action to use, as stated 
in their descriptions.
The DM might require you to use an action for any 
of these activities w hen it needs special care or when it 
presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM 
could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a 
stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
Re a c t i o n s
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow 
you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction 
is an instant response to a trigger of som e kind, which 
can occu r on your turn or on som eone else’s. The 
opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the 
m ost com m on type of reaction.
W hen you take a reaction, you can’t take another one 
until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts 
another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its 
turn right after the reaction.
Mo v e m e n t  a n d  Po sit io n
In combat, characters and m onsters are in constant 
motion, often using movement and position to gain 
the upper hand.
In t e r a c t in g  w it h  O b je c t s  Ar o u n d  Yo u
Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in 
tandem with your movement and action:
•  draw or sheathe a sword
•  open or close a door
•  withdraw a potion from your backpack
•  pick up a dropped axe
•  take a bauble from a  table
•  remove a ring from your finger
•  stuff some food into your mouth
•  plant a banner in the ground
•  fish a  few coins from your belt pouch
•  drink all the ale in a flagon
•  throw a  lever or a switch
•  pull a torch from a  sconce
•  take a book from a shelf you can reach
•  extinguish a small flame
•  don a mask
•  pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head
•  put your ear to a door
•  kick a small stone
•  turn a  key in a lock
•  tap the floor with a  10-foot pole
•  hand an item to another characterOn your turn, you can m ove a distance up to your 
speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as 
you like on your turn, following the rules here.
Your m ovement can include jumping, climbing, and 
swim ming. These different m odes of movement can 
be com bined with walking, or they can constitute your 
entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the 
distance of each part of your move from  your speed until 
it is used up or until you are done moving.
The “Special Types of M ovem ent’’ section in 
chapter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, 
and swim ming.
Br e a k i n g  U p Y o u r  M o v e
You can break up your movement on your turn, using 
som e of your speed before and after your action. For 
example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 
10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.
Mo v i n g  b e t w e e n  At t a c k s
If you take an action that includes m ore than one 
weapon attack, you can break up your movement even 
further by m oving between those attacks. For example, 
a fighter w ho can make two attacks with the Extra 
Attack feature and w ho has a speed of 25 feet could 
move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then 
attack again.
Us i n g  Di f f e r e n t  Sp e e d s
If you have m ore than one speed, such as your walking 
speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth 
between your speeds during your move. W henever you 
switch, subtract the distance you've already m oved from 
the new speed. The result determ ines how  much farther 
you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the 
new  speed during the current move.
For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying 
speed of 60 because a w izard cast the fly spell on you, 
you could fly 20 feet, then w alk 10 feet, and then leap 
into the air to fly 30 feet more.
Di f f i c u l t  Te r r a i n
Combat rarely takes place in bare room s or on 
featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar- 
choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of 
a typical fight contains difficult terrain.
Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 
extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in 
a space count as difficult terrain.
Low  furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, 
snow, and shallow bogs are examples o f difficult terrain. 
The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, 
also counts as difficult terrain.
Be i n g  Pr o n e
Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, 
either because they are knocked down or because they 
throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, 
a condition described in appendix A.
You can drop prone without using any of your 
speed. Standing up takes m ore effort; doing so costs

an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For 
example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet 
of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t 
have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.
To m ove while prone, you must crawl or use magic 
such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while 
crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult 
terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.
Mo v i n g  A r o u n d  O t h e r  
Cr e a t u r e s  
You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space.
In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's 
space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or 
sm aller than you. Rem em ber that another creature’s 
space is difficult terrain for you.
W hether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t 
willingly end your move in its space.
If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your 
move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained 
later in the chapter.
Fl y i n g  M o v e m e n t
Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but 
they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying 
creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or 
is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature 
falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held 
aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.
Cr e a t u r e  Si z e
Each creature takes up a different amount of space.
The Size Categories table show s how  much space 
a creature o f a particular size controls in combat.
Objects som etim es use the sam e size categories.
Size Ca t e g o r ie s Si z e Ca t e g o r i e s
Size Space
Tiny 2  1 / 2 by 2 1 / 2 ft
Small 5  by 5 ft.
Medium 5  by 5 ft.
Large 10 by 10 ft.
Huge 15 by 15 ft.
Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger
Sp a c e
A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively 
controls in combat, not an expression of its physical 
dim ensions. A  typical M edium creature isn't 5 feet 
wide, for example, but it does control a space that 
wide. If a M edium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide 
doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the 
hobgoblin lets them.
A  creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to 
fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the 
number of creatures that can surround another creature 
in combat. Assum ing M edium combatants, eight 
creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.
Because larger creatures take up m ore space, fewer 
o f them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures

Va r i a n t : Pl a y in g  o n a Gr id
If you play out a  combat using a square grid and miniatures 
or other tokens, follow these rules.
Squares.  Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.
Speed.  Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by 
square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot 
segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed 
into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed 
of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.
If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in 
squares on your character sheet.
Entering a Square.  To enter a square, you must have 
at least 1  square of movement left, even if the square is 
diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule for 
diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth 
play. The Dungeon M aster’ s Guide  provides guidance on using 
a more realistic approach.)
If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult 
terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for 
entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of 
movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.
Corners.  Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a 
wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.
Ranges.  To determine the range on a grid between two 
things— whether creatures or objects— start counting squares 
from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in 
the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.
 
crow d around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little 
room  for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty 
M edium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.
Sq u e e z i n g  i n t o  a Sm a l l e r  Sp a c e
A creature can squeeze through a space that is large 
enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a 
Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's 
only 5 feet wide. W hile squeezing through a space, 
a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it 
m oves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls 
and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the 
creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.
Actio n s  in Co m b a t
W hen you take your action on your turn, you can take 
one of the actions presented here, an action you gained 
from  your class or a special feature, or an action that 
you improvise. Many monsters have action options of 
their ow n in their stat blocks.
W hen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere 
in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is 
possible and what kind o f roll you need to make, if any, 
to determine success or failure.
At t a c k
The most com m on action to take in com bat is the Attack 
action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an 
arrow from  a bow, or brawling with your fists.
With this action, you make one melee or ranged 
attack. S ee the “M aking an Attack” section for the rules 
that govern attacks.
Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature 
of the fighter, allow you to make m ore than one attack 
with this action.Ca s t  a Sp e l l
Spellcasters such as w izards and clerics, as well as 
many m onsters, have access to spells and can use 
them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting 
time, which specifies whether the caster must use an 
action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the 
spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an 
action. M ost spells do have a casting time of 1  action, 
so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in com bat 
to cast such a spell. S ee chapter 10 for the rules 
on spellcasting.
Da s h
W hen you take the Dash action, you gain extra 
movement for the current turn. The increase equals 
your speed, after applying any m odifiers. With a speed 
of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your 
turn if you dash.
Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this 
additional movement by the sam e amount. If your speed 
of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can 
move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.
Di s e n g a g e
If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t 
provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
Do d g e
W hen you take the D odge action, you focus entirely on 
avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any 
attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you 
can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving 
throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are 
incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your 
speed drops to 0.
He l p
You can lend your aid to another creature in the 
com pletion of a task. W hen you take the Help action, 
the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability 
check it m akes to perform  the task you are helping with, 
provided that it m akes the check before the start of 
your next turn.
Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in 
attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, 
distract the target, or in som e other way team up to 
make your ally’s attack m ore effective. If your ally 
attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack 
roll is made with advantage.
Hid e
W hen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity 
(Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules 
in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain 
benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and 
Targets” section later in this chapter.

Ma k in g  a n At t a c kImprovising  an Action
Your character can do things not covered by the actions in  
this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating 
enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling 
for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions you can 
attempt are your imagination and your character’s ability 
scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in chapter 7  
for inspiration as you improvise.
When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in  
the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible 
and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine 
success or failure.
Re a d y
Se a r c h
W hen you take the Search action, you devote your 
attention to finding something. D epending on the 
nature of your search, the DM might have you make 
a W isdom  (Perception) check or an Intelligence 
(Investigation) check.
Use a n  O b j e c t
You norm ally interact with an object while doing 
som ething else, such as w hen you draw a sw ord as part 
of an attack. W hen an object requires your action for 
its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action 
is also useful w hen you want to interact with m ore than 
one object on your turn.
W hether you’re striking with a m elee weapon, firing a 
w eapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a 
spell, an attack has a simple structure.Som etim es you want to get the jum p on a foe or wait for 
a particular circum stance before you act. To do so, you 
can take the Ready action on your turn so that you can 
act later in the round using your reaction.
First, you decide what perceivable circum stance 
will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action 
you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose 
to move up to your speed in response to it. Exam ples 
include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the 
lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me,
I move away.”
W hen the trigger occurs, you can either take your 
reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore 
the trigger. Rem em ber that you can take only one 
reaction per round.
W hen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but 
hold its energy, which you release with your reaction 
when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must 
have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the 
spell’s m agic requires concentration (explained in 
chapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the spell 
dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are 
concentrating on the web  spell and ready magic missile,  
your web  spell ends, and if you take damage before 
you release magic missile  with your reaction, your 
concentration might be broken.

At t a c k  R o l l s
W hen you make an attack, your attack roll determines 
whether the attack hits or m isses. To make an attack 
roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the 
total o f the roll plus m odifiers equals or exceeds the 
target’s A rm or Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC o f a 
character is determined at character creation, whereas 
the AC of a monster is in its stat block.
Mo d if ie r s  t o t h e  Ro l l
W hen a character m akes an attack roll, the two most 
com m on modifiers to the roll are an ability m odifier 
and the character’s proficiency bonus. W hen a monster 
m akes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is 
provided in its stat block.
A bility M odifier.  The ability m odifier used for a melee 
w eapon attack is Strength, and the ability m odifier used 
for a ranged w eapon attack is Dexterity. W eapons that 
have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.
S om e spells also require an attack roll. The ability 
m odifier used for a spell attack depends on the 
spellcasting ability o f the spellcaster, as explained 
in chapter 10.
P roficien cy B onus.  You add your proficiency bonus 
to your attack roll when you attack using a w eapon with 
which you have proficiency, as w ell as w hen you attack 
with a spell.
Ro l l in g  1  o r 20
Som etim es fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing 
the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.
If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits 
regardless o f any modifiers or the target’s AC. In 
addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later 
in this chapter.
If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack m isses 
regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.
Un s e e n  A t t a c k e r s  a n d  T a r g e t s1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack’s 
range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. Determine modifiers. The DM determines whether 
the target has cover and whether you have advantage 
or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, 
special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties 
or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a 
hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has 
rules that specify otherwise. S om e attacks cause 
special effects in addition to or instead o f damage.
If there’s ever any question whether som ething you’re 
doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re 
making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.
Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice 
by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking 
in darkness.
W hen you attack a target that you can’t see, you have 
disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether 
you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting 
a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in

the location you targeted, you automatically m iss, but 
the DM typically just says that the attack m issed, not 
whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.
W hen a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on 
attack rolls against it.
If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when 
you m ake an attack, you give away your location when 
the attack hits or m isses.
Ra n g e d  A t t a c k s
W hen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow  or a 
crossbow , hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles 
to strike a foe at a distance. A  monster might shoot 
spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a 
ranged attack.
Ra n g e
You can make ranged attacks only against targets within 
a specified range.
If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a 
single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.
S om e ranged attacks, such as those made with a 
longbow  or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller 
number is the norm al range, and the larger num ber is 
the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when 
your target is beyond norm al range, and you can’t attack 
a target beyond the long range.
Ra n g e d  At t a c k s  i n Cl o s e  Co m b a t
Aim ing a ranged attack is m ore difficult w hen a foe 
is next to you. W hen you m ake a ranged attack with 
a weapon, a spell, or som e other means, you have 
disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet 
o f a hostile creature w ho can see you and w ho isn’t 
incapacitated.
Me l e e  A t t a c k s
Used in hand-to-hand combat, a m elee attack allows 
you to attack a foe within your reach. A  m elee attack 
typically uses a handheld w eapon such as a sword, 
a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster m akes a 
melee attack w hen it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, 
tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve 
making a m elee attack.
M ost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus 
attack targets within 5 feet of them w hen making a 
m elee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger 
than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach 
than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.
W hen you are unarmed, you can fight in melee by 
m aking an unarmed strike, as show n in the weapon 
table in chapter 5.
Op p o r t u n i t y  At t a c k s
In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies 
to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past 
your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so 
provokes an opportunity attack.
You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile 
creature that you can see m oves out of your reach. To 
make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction 
to m ake one m elee attack against the provokingCo n t e s t s  in Co m b a t
Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of 
your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a  contest. This 
section includes the most common contests that require an 
action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The DM 
can use these contests as models for improvising others.
creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature’s 
movement, occurring right before the creature 
leaves your reach.
You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by 
taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an 
opportunity attack when you teleport or when som eone 
or som ething m oves you without using your movement, 
action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an 
opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s 
reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.
Two - W e a p o n  Fi g h t i n g
W hen you take the Attack action and attack with a light 
melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can 
use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee 
weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t 
add your ability m odifier to the damage of the bonus 
attack, unless that modifier is negative.
If either w eapon has the thrown property, you 
can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee 
attack with it.
Gr a p p l i n g
W hen you want to grab a creature or w restle with it, 
you can use the Attack action to make a special melee 
attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks 
with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
The target of your grapple must be no m ore than one 
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. 
Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target 
by m aking a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) 
check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the 
ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to 
the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition 
specifies the things that end it, and you can release the 
target whenever you like (no action required).
Escaping a Grapple.  A grappled creature can use its 
action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength 
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by 
your Strength (Athletics) check.
Moving a Grappled Creature.  W hen you move, you 
can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but 
your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more 
sizes smaller than you.
Sh o v i n g  a Cr e a t u r e
Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee 
attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or 
push it away from  you. If you’re able to make multiple 
attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces 
one of them.
The target of your shove must be no m ore than one 
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. 
You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the 
target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)

check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win 
the contest, you either knock the target prone or push 
it 5 feet away from  you.
Cover
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide 
cover during combat, making a target m ore difficult 
to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an 
attack or other effect originates on the opposite side 
of the cover.
There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind 
multiple sources of cover, only the most protective 
degree o f cover applies; the degrees aren't added 
together. For example, if a target is behind a creature 
that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three- 
quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and 
Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an 
obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle 
might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow 
tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an 
enemy or a friend.
A  target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus 
to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A  target has three- 
quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered 
by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an 
arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.
A target with total cover can’t be targeted directly 
by an attack or a spell, although som e spells can reach 
such a target by including it in an area of effect. A 
target has total cover if it is completely concealed by 
an obstacle.
Da m a g e  a n d  He a l in g
Injury and the risk of death are constant com panions 
o f those w ho explore the w orlds of D&D. The thrust of 
a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from  a 
fireball  spell all have the potential to damage, or even 
kill, the hardiest of creatures.
Hi t Po i n t s
Hit points represent a com bination of physical and 
mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures 
with m ore hit points are m ore difficult to kill. Those 
with fewer hit points are m ore fragile.
A  creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit 
points) can be any number from  the creature’s hit point 
m aximum down to 0. This num ber changes frequently 
as a creature takes damage or receives healing.
W henever a creature takes damage, that damage is 
subtracted from  its hit points. The loss of hit points has 
no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature 
drops to 0 hit points.
Da m a g e  R o l l s
Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability 
specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die 
or dice, add any m odifiers, and apply the damage to 
your target. M agic w eapons, special abilities, and other 
factors can grant a bonus to damage.W hen attacking with a weapon, you add your ability 
modifier—the sam e modifier used for the attack roll— 
to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for 
damage and whether to add any modifiers.
If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than  
one target at the sam e time, roll the damage once for 
all of them. For example, when a w izard casts fireball  or 
a cleric casts flame strike , the spell’s damage is rolled 
once for all creatures caught in the blast.
Cr i t i c a l  Hi t s
W hen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice 
for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the 
attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then 
add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, 
you can roll all the damage dice at once.
For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, 
roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add 
your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other 
damage dice, such as from  the rogue’s Sneak Attack 
feature, you roll those dice twice as well.
Da m a g e  Ty p e s
Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful 
effects deal different types of damage. Damage types 
have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as 
damage resistance, rely on the types.
The damage types follow, with examples to help a 
DM assign a damage type to a new effect.
Acid.  The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath 
and the dissolving enzym es secreted by a black pudding 
deal acid damage.
Bludgeoning.  Blunt force attacks—hamm ers, falling, 
constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.
Cold.  The infernal chill radiating from  an ice devil’s 
spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath 
deal cold damage.
Fire.  Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells 
conjure flames to deal fire damage.
Force.  Force is pure magical energy focused into a 
damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are 
spells, including magic missile  and spiritual weapon.
Lightning.  A lightning bolt  spell and a blue dragon’s 
breath deal lightning damage.
Necrotic.  Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead 
and a spell such as chill touch,  withers matter and 
even the soul.
Piercing.  Puncturing and impaling attacks, including 
spears and m onsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.
Poison.  Venom ous stings and the toxic gas o f a green 
dragon’s breath deal poison damage.
Psychic.  Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s 
psionic blast deal psychic damage.
Radiant.  Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame  
strike  spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh 
like fire and overloads the spirit with power.
Slashing.  Sw ords, axes, and m onsters’ claws deal 
slashing damage.
Thunder.  A concussive burst of sound, such as the 
effect o f the thunderwave  spell, deals thunder damage.

Da m a g e  R e s i s t a n c e  a n d  
Vu l n e r a b i l i t y
S om e creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or 
unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.
If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage 
type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a 
creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage 
type, damage of that type is doubled against it.
Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after 
all other m odifiers to damage. For example, a creature 
has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an 
attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature 
is also within a m agical aura that reduces all damage by
5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, 
so the creature takes 10 damage.
Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that 
affect the sam e damage type count as only one instance. 
For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage 
as w ell as resistance to all nonm agical damage, the 
damage of a nonm agical fire is reduced by half against 
the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.
He a l i n g
Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even 
death is reversible through pow erful magic. Rest can 
restore a creature's hit points (as explained in chapter 
8), and magical m ethods such as a cure wounds  spell or 
a potion of healing  can remove damage in an instant.
W hen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit 
points regained are added to its current hit points. A 
creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, 
so any hit points regained in excess of this num ber are 
lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of 
healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a 
hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points 
from  the druid, not 8.
A  creature that has died can’t regain hit points until 
m agic such as the revivify  spell has restored it to life.
D r o p p i n g  t o  0 H i t  P o i n t s
W hen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or 
fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.
In s t a n t  De a t h
Massive damage can kill you instantly. W hen damage 
reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage 
remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals 
or exceeds your hit point maximum.
For example, a cleric with a m axim um  of 
12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she 
takes 18 damage from  an attack, she is reduced 
to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because 
the remaining damage equals her hit point 
maximum, the cleric dies.
Fa l l i n g  Un c o n s c i o u s
If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill 
you, you fall unconscious (see appendix A). This 
unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.De s c r ib in g  t h e  Ef f e c t s  o f Da m a g e
Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. 
When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit 
point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When 
you drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs 
of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you 
to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a  bleeding injury or 
other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious.
De a t h  Sa v i n g  Th r o w s
W henever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you 
must make a special saving throw, called a death saving 
throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death 
or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one 
isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate 
now, aided only by spells and features that improve your 
chances of succeeding on a saving throw.
Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. 
Otherwise, you fail. A  success or failure has no effect 
by itself. On your third success, you becom e stable (see 
below). On your third failure, you die. The successes 
and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track 
of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of 
both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or 
becom e stable.
Rolling 1 or 20.  W hen you make a death saving throw 
and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you 
roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.
Damage at 0 Hit Points.  If you take any damage while 
you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw 
failure. If the damage is from  a critical hit, you suffer 
two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds 
your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.
St a b i l i z i n g  a Cr e a t u r e
The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to 
heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at 
least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death 
saving throw.
You can use your action to administer first aid to an 
unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which 
requires a successful DC 10 W isdom  (M edicine) check.
A  stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws, 
even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain 
unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must

start making death saving throws again, if it takes any 
damage. A  stable creature that isn’t healed regains 
1 hit point after 1d4 hours.
Mo n s t e r s  a n d  De a t h
Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 
0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and 
make death saving throws.
Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters 
are com m on exceptions; the DM might have them 
fall unconscious and follow the sam e rules as 
player characters.
Kn o c k i n g  a C r e a t u r e  O u t
Som etim es an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, 
rather than deal a killing blow. W hen an attacker 
reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, 
the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker 
can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. 
The creature falls unconscious and is stable.
Te m p o r a r y  H i t Po i n t s
Som e spells and special abilities confer tem porary hit 
points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual 
hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit 
points that protect you from injury.
W hen you have tem porary hit points and take damage, 
the tem porary hit points are lost first, and any leftover 
damage carries over to your normal hit points. For 
example, if you have 5 tem porary hit points and take 
7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then 
take 2 damage.
B ecause tem porary hit points are separate from 
your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point 
maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit 
points and receive tem porary hit points.
Healing can’t restore tem porary hit points, and they 
can’t be added together. If you have tem porary hit points 
and receive m ore of them, you decide whether to keep 
the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, 
if a spell grants you 12 tem porary hit points w hen you 
already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.
If you have 0 hit points, receiving tem porary hit points 
doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. 
They can still absorb damage directed at you while 
you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.
Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points 
has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you 
finish a long rest.
Mo u n t e d  Co m b a t
A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard 
casting spells from  the back of a griffon, or a cleric 
soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the 
benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.
A willing creature that is at least one size larger than 
you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a 
mount, using the following rules.Mo u n t i n g  a n d  D i s m o u n t i n g
Once during your move, you can mount a creature that 
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. D oing so costs an 
amount of movement equal to half your speed. For 
example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 
feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t 
mount it if you don’t have 15 feet o f movement left or 
if your speed is 0.
If an effect m oves your mount against its w ill while 
you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity 
saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a 
space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while 
mounted, you must make the sam e saving throw.
If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your 
reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. 
Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a 
space within 5 feet it.
Co n t r o l l i n g  a M o u n t
W hile you're mounted, you have two options. You 
can either control the mount or allow it to act 
independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, 
act independently.
You can control a mount only if it has been trained 
to accept a rider. Dom esticated horses, donkeys, and 
similar creatures are assum ed to have such training. 
The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match 
yours w hen you mount it. It m oves as you direct it, and 
it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and 
Dodge. A  controlled mount can m ove and act even on 
the turn that you mount it.
An independent mount retains its place in the 
initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on 
the actions the mount can take, and it m oves and acts 
as it w ishes. It might flee from  combat, rush to attack 
and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against 
your wishes.
In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity 
attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you 
or the mount.
Underw ater  Co m b a t
W hen adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their 
undersea hom es, fight off sharks in an ancient 
shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon 
room , they must fight in a challenging environment. 
Underwater the following rules apply.
W hen making a melee weapon attack, a creature 
that doesn’t have a sw im m ing speed (either natural or 
granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll 
unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, 
spear, or trident.
A ranged weapon attack automatically m isses 
a target beyond the w eapon’s norm al range. Even 
against a target within normal range, the attack roll has 
disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow , a net, or 
a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, 
trident, or dart).
Creatures and objects that are fully im m ersed in 
water have resistance to fire damage.

Ch a p t e r  10: Sp e l l c a s t in g
M AGIC PERMEATES THE WORLDS OF D&D AND
most often appears in the form  o f a spell. 
This chapter provides the rules for 
casting spells. Different character 
classes have distinctive ways of learning 
and preparing their spells, and monsters 
use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, 
a spell follow s the rules here.
Wh a t  Is a Spell ?
A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping 
of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse 
into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, 
a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of 
raw m agic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a 
particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, 
and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in 
most cases, all in the span o f seconds.
Spells can be versatile tools, w eapons, or protective 
wards. They can deal damage or undo it, im pose or 
remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy 
away, and restore life to the dead.
Uncounted thousands of spells have been created 
over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of 
them are long forgotten. S om e might yet lie recorded in 
crum bling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped 
in the minds of dead gods. Or they might som eday be 
reinvented by a character w ho has am assed enough 
pow er and w isdom  to do so.
Sp e l l  Le v e l
Every spell has a level from  0 to 9. A spell’s level is a 
general indicator of how  powerful it is, with the lowly 
(but still impressive) magic missile  at 1st level and 
the earth-shaking wish  at 9th. Cantrips—simple but 
pow erful spells that characters can cast almost by rote— 
are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a 
spellcaster must be to use that spell.
Spell level and character level don’t correspond 
directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th 
level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.
Kn o w n  a n d  P r e p a r e d  Sp e l l s
Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must 
have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access 
to the spell in a magic item. M embers o f a few classes, 
including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of 
spells they know  that are always fixed in mind. The 
sam e thing is true o f many m agic-using monsters. Other 
spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a 
process o f preparing spells. This process varies for 
different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.
Ca s t i n g  in Ar m o r
Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required 
for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you 
are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted 
and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.In every case, the number o f spells a caster can 
have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the 
character’s level.
Sp e l l  Sl o t s
Regardless of how  many spells a caster knows or 
prepares, he or she can cast only a limited num ber of 
spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic 
and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is 
physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells 
are even m ore so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s 
description (except that of the warlock) includes a table 
showing how  many spell slots of each spell level a 
character can use at each character level. For example, 
the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots 
and two 2nd-level slots.
W hen a character casts a spell, he or she expends 
a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” 
a slot with the spell. You can think o f a spell slot as a 
groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger 
for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot 
of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level 
slot. S o  when Umara casts magic missile,  a 1st-level 
spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has 
three remaining.
Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots 
(see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).
Som e characters and m onsters have special abilities 
that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For 
example, a m onk who follow s the Way o f the Four 
Elements, a w arlock who chooses certain eldritch 
invocations, and a pit fiend from  the Nine Hells can all 
cast spells in such a way.
Ca s t i n g  a Sp e l l  a t a Hi g h e r  Le v e l  
W hen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a 
higher level than the spell, the spell assum es the higher 
level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic  
missile  using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic  
missile  is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill 
the slot it is put into.
Som e spells, such as magic missile  and cure wounds,  
have m ore pow erful effects when cast at a higher level, 
as detailed in a spell’s description.
Ca n t r i p s
A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without 
using a spell slot and without being prepared in 
advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the 
caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic 
needed to produce the effect over and over. A  cantrip’s 
spell level is 0.
Ri t u a l s
Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell 
can be cast following the norm al rules for spellcasting, 
or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of 
a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.

It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which m eans the 
ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.
To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a 
feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the 
druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must 
also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells 
known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies 
otherwise, as the w izard’s does.
Ca s t in g  a Spell
W hen a character casts any spell, the sam e basic rules 
are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the 
spell’s effects.
Each spell description in chapter 11 begins with a block 
of information, including the spell’s name, level, school 
of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. 
The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.
Ca s t i n g  Ti m e
Most spells require a single action to cast, but som e 
spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or m uch more 
time to cast.
Bo n u s  Ac t i o n
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You 
must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, 
provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action 
this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same 
turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1  action.
Re a c t i o n s
S om e spells can be cast as reactions. These spells 
take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast 
in response to som e event. If a spell can be cast as a 
reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when 
you can do so.
Lo n g e r  Ca s t i n g  Tim e s
Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require 
m ore time to cast: minutes or even hours. W hen you 
cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single 
action or reaction, you must spend your action each 
turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your 
concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” 
below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, 
but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try 
casting the spell again, you must start over.
Ra n g e
The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range.
For a spell like magic missile,  the target is a creature. 
For a spell like fireball,  the target is the point in space 
where the ball of fire erupts.
M ost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Som e 
spells can target only a creature (including you) that you 
touch. Other spells, such as the shield  spell, affect only 
you. These spells have a range of self.
Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate 
from  you also have a range o f self, indicating that the 
origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas 
o f Effect” later in the this chapter).

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its 
range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.
Co m p o n e n t s
A  spell’s com ponents are the physical requirements you 
must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description 
indicates whether it requires verbal (V), som atic (S), 
or material (M ) com ponents. If you can’t provide one 
or m ore of a spell’s com ponents, you are unable to 
cast the spell.
Ve r b a l  ( V )
M ost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The 
w ords themselves aren’t the source o f the spell’s power; 
rather, the particular com bination of sounds, with 
specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic 
in motion. Thus, a character w ho is gagged or in an area 
of silence, such as one created by the silence  spell, can’t 
cast a spell with a verbal component.
So m a t i c  (S )
Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful 
gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell 
requires a som atic com ponent, the caster must have free 
use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.
Ma t e r i a l  (M )
Casting som e spells requires particular objects, 
specified in parentheses in the com ponent entry.
A  character can use a component pouch or a 
spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5) in place of 
the com ponents specified for a spell. But if a cost is 
indicated for a com ponent, a character must have that 
specific com ponent before he or she can cast the spell.
If a spell states that a material com ponent is 
consum ed by the spell, the caster must provide this 
com ponent for each casting of the spell.
A  spellcaster must have a hand free to access these 
com ponents, but it can be the sam e hand that he or she 
uses to perform  som atic com ponents.
Du r a t i o n
A  spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. 
A  duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, 
or even years. S om e spells specify that their effects last 
until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.
In s t a n t a n e o u s
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, 
heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way 
that can’t be dispelled, because its m agic exists only 
for an instant.
Co n c e n t r a t i o n
S om e spells require you to maintain concentration 
in order to keep their m agic active. If you lose 
concentration, such a spell ends.
If a spell must be maintained with concentration, 
that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell 
specifies how  long you can concentrate on it. You can 
end concentration at any time (no action required).Th e Sc h o o l s  o f M a g ic
Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called 
schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these 
categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in  
essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous 
study or is bestowed by a  deity.
The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no 
rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.
Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some 
of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, 
negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures 
to other planes of existence.
Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects 
and creatures from one location to another. Some spells 
summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas 
others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some 
conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
Divination spells reveal information, whether in the form of 
secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations 
of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of 
distant people or places.
Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing 
or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies 
see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of 
action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a 
desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others 
channel positive energy to heal wounds.
Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They 
cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things 
that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember 
things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom 
images that any creature can see, but the most insidious 
illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and 
death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, 
drain the life energy from another creature, create the 
undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells 
such as animate dead  is not a good act, and only evil casters 
use such spells frequently.
Transmutation spells change the properties of a  creature, 
object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a  
harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an 
object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s 
innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.
Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t 
interfere with concentration. The following factors can 
break concentration:
•  Casting another spell that requires concentration.
You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another 
spell that requires concentration. You can’t concen­
trate on two spells at once.
•  Taking damage. W henever you take damage while 
you are concentrating on a spell, you must m ake a 
Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentra­
tion. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, 
whichever number is higher. If you take damage from 
multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s 
breath, you make a separate saving throw for each 
source of damage.
•  Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration 
on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.

The DM might also decide that certain environmental 
phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while 
you’re on a storm -tossed ship, require you to succeed 
on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain 
concentration on a spell.
Ta r g e t s
A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets 
to be affected by the spell’s m agic. A  spell's description 
tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or 
a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).
Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature 
might not know  it w as targeted by a spell at all. An effect 
like crackling lightning is obvious, but a m ore subtle 
effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, 
typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.
A  C l e a r  Pa t h  t o t h e  Ta r g e t
To target som ething, you must have a clear path to it, 
so it can’t be behind total cover.
If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t 
see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you 
and that point, the point o f origin com es into being on 
the near side of that obstruction.
Ta r g e t i n g  Yo u r s e l f
If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can 
choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or 
specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the 
area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.
Ar e a s  o f E f f e c t
Spells such as burning hands  and cone o f cold  cover an 
area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.
A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, 
which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, 
cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has 
a point of origin, a location from  which the spell’s 
energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how  youposition its point of origin. Typically, 
a point of origin is a point in space, but 
som e spells have an area w hose origin is a 
creature or an object.
A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from  the point 
of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from  the 
point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that 
location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of 
these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total 
cover, as explained in chapter 9.
Co n e
A cone extends in a direction you choose from  its point 
of origin. A con e’s width at a given point along its length 
is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. 
A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.
A cone’s point of origin is not included in the con e’s 
area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
Cu b e
You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere 
on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed 
as the length of each side.
A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s 
area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
Cy l in d e r
A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a 
particular radius, as given in the spell description. The 
circle must either be on the ground or at the height of 
the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in 
straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of 
the circle, form ing the base of the cylinder. The spell’s 
effect then shoots up from  the base or down from  the 
top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.
A  cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s 
area of effect.

Li n e
A  line extends from  its point of origin in a straight path 
up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.
A  line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area 
of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
Sp h e r e
You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere 
extends outward from  that point. The sphere’s 
size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends 
from the point.
A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s 
area of effect.
Sa v i n g  T h r o w s
Many spells specify that a target can make a saving 
throw to avoid som e or all of a spell’s effects. The spell 
specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and 
what happens on a success or failure.
The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your 
spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + 
any special modifiers.
At t a c k  R o l l s
S om e spells require the caster to make an attack roll 
to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended 
target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your 
spellcasting ability m odifier + your proficiency bonus.
M ost spells that require attack rolls involve ranged 
attacks. Rem em ber that you have disadvantage on a 
ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile 
creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated 
(see chapter 9).
Co m b i n i n g  M a g i c a l  Ef f e c t s
The effects of different spells add together while 
the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of 
the sam e spell cast multiple times don't com bine, 
however. Instead, the m ost potent effect—such as the 
highest bonus—from  those castings applies while their 
durations overlap.
For example, if two clerics cast bless  on the same 
target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only 
once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.Th e We a v e  o f Ma g ic
The worlds within the D&D multiverse are magical places.
All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential 
energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living 
creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of 
creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating 
every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of 
energy throughout the multiverse.
Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they 
make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between 
the will of a  spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The 
spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and 
recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters 
have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. B y 
any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and 
inaccessible;the most powerful archmage can't light a candle 
with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But 
surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning 
to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an 
eye, or even reverse death itself.
All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds 
of magic access it in a  variety of ways. The spells of wizards, 
warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane 
magic. These spells rely on an understanding— learned or 
intuitive— of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks 
directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired 
effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane 
magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are 
called divine magic. These spellcasters’ access to the Weave 
is mediated by divine power— gods, the divine forces of 
nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath.
Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the 
Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible. 
When characters use divination spells such as detect magic  or 
identify,  they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as dispel magic  
smooths the Weave. Spells such as antimagic field  rearrange 
the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through, 
the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave 
is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways— or 
not at all.

An i m a l  M e ss e n g e r  
2nd-level enchantment (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a m orsel of food)
Duration: 24 hours
By m eans of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a 
message. C hoose a Tiny beast you can see within range, 
such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a 
location, which you must have visited, and a recipient 
w ho matches a general description, such as “a man or 
w om an dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a 
red-haired dw arf w earing a pointed hat.” You also speak 
a m essage of up to twenty-five words. The target beast 
travels for the duration of the spell toward the specifiedlocation, covering about 50 m iles per 24 hours for a 
flying messenger, or 25 m iles for other animals.
W hen the m essenger arrives, it delivers your m essage 
to the creature that you described, replicating the sound 
of your voice. The m essenger speaks only to a creature 
matching the description you gave. If the m essenger 
doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the 
m essage is lost, and the beast m akes its way back to 
where you cast this spell.

An i m a l  Sh a p e s
8th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours
Your m agic turns others into beasts. C hoose any 
number of willing creatures that you can see within 
range. You transform each target into the form  o f a 
Large or sm aller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or 
lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to 
transform affected creatures into new forms.
The transformation lasts for the duration for each 
target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. 
You can choose a different form  for each target. A 
target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of 
the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment 
and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma scores. The 
target assum es the hit points o f its new form, and when 
it reverts to its norm al form, it returns to the number 
of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as 
a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage 
carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess 
damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s norm al form  to 0 
hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is 
limited in the actions it can perform  by the nature of its 
new  form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.
The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target 
can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from  any of 
its equipment.
An i m a t e  De a d  
3rd-level necrom ancy
Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, 
and a pinch of bone dust)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell creates an undead servant. C hoose a pile 
of bones or a corpse of a M edium or Sm all humanoid 
within range. Your spell im bues the target with a foul 
m im icry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The 
target becom es a skeleton if you chose bones or a 
zom bie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature’s 
game statistics).
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action 
to mentally com m and any creature you made with 
this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you

control multiple creatures, you can com m and any or all 
of them at the sam e time, issuing the sam e com m and to 
each one). You decide what action the creature will take 
and where it w ill move during its next turn, or you can 
issue a general com m and, such as to guard a particular 
cham ber or corridor. If you issue no com m ands, the 
creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. 
O nce given an order, the creature continues to follow  it 
until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, 
after which it stops obeying any com m and you’ve given 
it. To maintain control of the creature for another 
24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature 
again before the current 24-hour period ends. This 
use o f the spell reasserts your control over up to four 
creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than 
animating a new  one.
A t H igher L evels.  W hen you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert 
control over two additional undead creatures for each 
slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must com e 
from  a different corpse or pile of bones.
An i m a t e  O bjects

Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Objects com e to life at your com m and. Choose up to 
ten nonm agical objects within range that are not being 
w orn or carried. M edium targets count as two objects, 
Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets 
count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object 
larger than Huge. Each target animates and becom es a 
creature under your control until the spell ends or until 
reduced to 0 hit points.
As a bonus action, you can mentally com m and any 
creature you made with this spell if the creature is 
within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, 
you can com m and any or all of them at the sam e time, 
issuing the sam e com m and to each one). You decide 
what action the creature w ill take and w here it will 
move during its next turn, or you can issue a general 
com m and, such as to guard a particular cham ber or 
corridor. If you issue no com m ands, the creature only 
defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given 
an order, the creature continues to follow  it until its 
task is complete.

Huge 80 1 0 +8 to h it, 2d1 2  + 4 damage 1 8 6
An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, 
attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. 
Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and W isdomare 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the 
object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for 
locom otion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and 
can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface 
or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its 
speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and 
is blind beyond that distance. W hen the animated object 
drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object 
form, and any remaining damage carries over to its 
original object form.
If you com m and an object to attack, it can make a 
single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet 
of it. It m akes a slam attack with an attack bonus and 
bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM 
might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or 
piercing damage based on its form.
A t H igher L evels.  If you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two 
additional objects for each slot level above 5th.
An t il if e  Sh e l l  
5th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self (10-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A  shim m ering barrier extends out from  you in a 10-foot 
radius and m oves with you, remaining centered on 
you and hedging out creatures other than undead and 
constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.
The barrier prevents an affected creature from  
passing or reaching through. An affected creature 
can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach 
w eapons through the barrier.
If you move so that an affected creature is forced to 
pass through the barrier, the spell ends.
An t i m a g i c  Fie l d
8th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of pow dered iron or
iron filings)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A  10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds 
you. This area is divorced from  the magical energy that 
suffuses the multiverse. W ithin the sphere, spells can’t 
be cast, sum m oned creatures disappear, and even m agic 
items becom e mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere 
m oves with you, centered on you.
Spells and other magical effects, except those created 
by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere 
and can’t protrude into it. A  slot expended to cast 
a suppressed spell is consum ed. W hile an effect is 
suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends 
suppressed counts against its duration.
Targeted E ffects.  Spells and other magical effects, 
such as magic m issile  and charm p erson , that target 
a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect 
on that target.

Areas o f Magic.  The area of another spell or magical 
effect, such as fireball,  can’t extend into the sphere.
If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of 
the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.
For example, the flames created by a wall o f fire  are 
suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall 
if the overlap is large enough.
Spells.  Any active spell or other magical effect on a 
creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while 
the creature or object is in it.
Magic Items.  The properties and pow ers of 
m agic items are suppressed in the sphere. For 
example, a + 1 longsword  in the sphere functions as a 
nonm agical longsword.
A m agic w eapon’s properties and pow ers are 
suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or 
wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a m agic w eapon 
or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere 
(for example, if you fire a m agic arrow or throw a magic 
spear at a target outside the sphere), the m agic of the 
item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
Magical Travel.  Teleportation and planar travel 
fail to w ork in the sphere, whether the sphere is the 
destination or the departure point for such magical 
travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of 
existence, as well as an opening to an extradim ensional 
space such as that created by the rope trick  spell, 
temporarily closes while in the sphere.
Creatures and Objects.  A  creature or object 
sum m oned or created by m agic temporarily w inks out 
o f existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly 
reappears once the space the creature occupied is no 
longer within the sphere.
Dispel Magic.  Spells and magical effects such as 
dispel magic  have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the 
spheres created by different antimagic field  spells don’t 
nullify each other.
An t i p a t h y /Sy m p a t h y  
8th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 hour 
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in 
vinegar for the antipathy  effect or a drop of honey for 
the sympathy  effect)
Duration: 10 days
This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. 
You target som ething within range, either a Huge or 
sm aller object or creature or an area that is no larger 
than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent 
creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or 
repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose 
antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.
Antipathy.  The enchantment causes creatures of the 
kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the 
area and avoid the target. W hen such a creature can 
see the target or com es within 60 feet of it, the creature 
must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or becom e 
frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can 
see the target or is within 60 feet of it. W hile frightened 
by the target, the creature must use its movement tomove to the nearest safe spot from  which it can’t see 
the target. If the creature m oves m ore than 60 feet from 
the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer 
frightened, but the creature becom es frightened again if 
it regains sight of the target or m oves within 60 feet o f it.
Sympathy.  The enchantment causes the specified 
creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target 
while within 60 feet o f it or able to see it. W hen such a 
creature can see the target or com es within 60 feet of it, 
the creature must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or 
use its movement on each o f its turns to enter the area 
or move within reach of the target. W hen the creature 
has done so, it can’t willingly m ove away from  the target.
If the target dam ages or otherwise harms an affected 
creature, the affected creature can make a W isdom  
saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
Ending the Effect.  If an affected creature ends its 
turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see 
it, the creature m akes a W isdom  saving throw. On a 
successful save, the creature is no longer affected by 
the target and recognizes the feeling o f repugnance or 
attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by 
the spell is allowed another W isdom  saving throw every 
24 hours while the spell persists.
A creature that successfully saves against this effect 
is im mune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be 
affected again.
Ar c a n e  Ey e
4th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You create an invisible, magical eye within range that 
hovers in the air for the duration.
You mentally receive visual information from the eye, 
which has norm al vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. 
The eye can look in every direction.
A s an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in 
any direction. There is no limit to how  far away from 
you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane 
o f existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, 
but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1  
inch in diameter.
Ar c a n e  Ga t e
6th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 500 feet 
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create linked teleportation portals that remain open

you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one 
point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet 
in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal w ould 
open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, 
and the casting is lost.
The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings 
filled with mist, hovering inches from  the ground and

perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A  ring is 
visible only from  one side (your choice), which is the side 
that functions as a portal.
Any creature or object entering the portal exits from 
the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each 
other; passing through a portal from  the nonportal side 
has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque 
and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can 
rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side 
faces in a different direction.

Duration: Special
You and up to eight willing creatures within range 
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the 
spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already 
on that plane). The material body you leave behind is 
u nconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it 
doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.
Your astral body resem bles your m ortal form in 
alm ost every way, replicating your game statistics and 
possessions. The principal difference is the addition of 
a silvery cord that extends from  between your shoulder 
blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after
1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As 
long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way 
home. If the cord is cut—som ething that can happen 
only when an effect specifically states that it does—your 
soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral 
Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any 
other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the 
plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and 
possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing 
you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.
Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage 
or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your 
physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
The spell ends for you and your com panions when 
you use your action to dism iss it. W hen the spell ends, 
the affected creature returns to its physical body, 
and it awakens.
The spell might also end early for you or one o f your 
com panions. A  successful dispel magic  spell used 
against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that 
creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form 
drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If 
the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls 
the creature’s astral form  back to its body, ending its 
state of suspended animation.
If you are returned to your body prematurely, your 
com panions remain in their astral form s and must find 
their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping 
to 0 hit points.

cover against the target. The target can't move through 
the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or

Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack 
against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict 
the creature with a disease of your choice from  any of 
the ones described below.
At the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make 
a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of 
these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the 
duration, and the creature stops making these saves. 
After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the 
creature recovers from  the disease, and the spell ends.
Since this spell induces a natural disease in its 
target, any effect that rem oves a disease or otherwise 
am eliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.

Duration: 10 days
Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that 
has a casting time of 1  action, and that can target you. 
You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part 
of casting contingency,  expending spell slots for both, but 
the contingent spell doesn't com e into effect. Instead, it 
takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You 
describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. 
For example, a contingency  cast with water breathing  
might stipulate that water breathing  com es into effect 
when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the 
circum stance is met for the first time, whether or not you 
want it to. and then contingency  ends.
The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even 
if it can normally target others. You can use only one 
contingency  spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, 
the effect of another contingency  spell on you ends. Also, 
contingency  ends on you if its material com ponent is 
ever not on your person.

Casting Time: 1  action 
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S , M (a drop of water and a 
pinch of dust)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water 
inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet 
on a side. You can choose from any o f the following 
effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your 
turn, you can repeat the sam e effect or choose a 
different one.
Flood.  You cause the water level of all standing water in 
the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes 
a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.
If you choose an area in a large body of water, you 
instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from  one 
side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any 
Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried 
with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles 
struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.
The water level remains elevated until the spell ends 
or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced

a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn 
while the flood effect lasts.
P art Water.  You cause water in the area to move 
apart and create a trench. The trench extends across 
the spell’s area, and the separated water form s a wall to 
either side. The trench rem ains until the spell ends or 
you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills 
in the trench over the course of the next round until the 
normal water level is restored.
R ed irect Flow.  You cause flowing water in the area 
to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has 
to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely 
directions. The water in the area m oves as you direct 
it, but once it m oves beyond the spell’s area, it resum es 
its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water 
continues to move in the direction you chose until the 
spell ends or you choose a different effect.
W hirlpool.  This effect requires a body of water 
at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause 
a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The 
whirlpool form s a vortex that is 5 feet w ide at the 
base, up to 50 feet w ide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any 
creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the 
vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A  creature can swim 
away from  the vortex by m aking a Strength (Athletics) 
check against your spell save DC.
W hen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on 
a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 
bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until 
the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes 
half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature 
caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim 
away from  the vortex as described above, but has 
disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.
The first time each turn that an object enters the 
vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this 
damage occu rs each round it rem ains in the vortex.

For the duration, you can read the thoughts o f certain 
creatures. W hen you cast the spell and as your action on 
each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind 
on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of 
you. If the creature you ch oose has an Intelligence of
3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature 
is unaffected.
You initially learn the surface thoughts of the 
creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As 
an action, you can either shift your attention to another 
creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the 
sam e creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target 
must make a W isdom  saving throw. If it fails, you gain 
insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, 
and som ething that loom s large in its mind (such as 
som ething it w orries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, 
the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are 
probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention 
to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use 
its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check 
contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, 
the spell ends.
Questions verbally directed at the target creature 
naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell 
is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.
You can also use this spell to detect the presence of 
thinking creatures you can’t see. W hen you cast the 
spell or as your action during the duration, you can 
search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can 
penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches o f any 
metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. 
You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or 
lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.
O nce you detect the presence of a creature in this way, 
you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as 
described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still 
be within range.

1st-level illusion
Casting Time: 1  action 
Range: Self 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1  hour
You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, 
w eapons, and other belongings on your person—look 
different until the spell ends or until you use your action 
to dism iss it. You can seem  1 foot shorter or taller and 
can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change 
your body type, so you must adopt a form  that has the 
sam e basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent 
of the illusion is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to 
physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell 
to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, 
and anyone w ho touches it w ould feel nothing or would 
feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear 
thinner than you are, the hand of som eone who reaches 
out to touch you would bump into you while it was 
seem ingly still in midair.
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use 
its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed 
on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your 
spell save DC.

A  thin green ray springs from  your pointing finger to a 
target that you can see within range. The target can be a 
creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such 
as the wall created by wall o f  force.
A creature targeted by this spell must make a 
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 
10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the 
target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.
A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing 
and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile 
of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life 
only by m eans of a true resurrection  or a wish  spell.
This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or 
smaller nonm agical object or a creation of magical

of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of 
it. A  m agic item is unaffected by this spell.

This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a 
creature known to you as the target of this spell. The 
target must be on the sam e plane of existence as you. 
Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be 
contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you 
touch, enters a trance state, acting as a m essenger. 
W hile in the trance, the m essenger is aware of his or 
her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.
If the target is asleep, the m essenger appears in the 
target’s dream s and can converse with the target as 
long as it rem ains asleep, through the duration of the 
spell. The m essenger can also shape the environment 
o f the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other 
images. The m essenger can emerge from the trance at 
any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target 
recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is 
awake when you cast the spell, the m essenger knows it, 
and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for 
the target to fall asleep, at which point the m essenger 
appears in the target’s dreams.
You can make the m essenger appear m onstrous 
and terrifying to the target. If you do, the m essenger 
can deliver a m essage of no m ore than ten w ords and 
then the target must make a W isdom  saving throw. On 
a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity 
spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s 
sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit 
from  that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it 
takes 3d6 psychic damage.
If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from  a 
nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target 
m akes its saving throw with disadvantage.

creatures and structures in contact with the ground 
in that area.
The ground in the area becom es difficult terrain.
Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must 
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the 
creature’s concentration is broken.
W hen you cast this spell and at the end of each turn 
you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the 
ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. 
On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
This spell can have additional effects depending on 
the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.
F issu res.  Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at 
the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total 
of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. 
Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends 
from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side.
A creature standing on a spot w here a fissure opens 
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A 
creature that successfully saves m oves with the fissure’s 
edge as it opens.
A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to 
automatically collapse (see below).
S tru ctu res.  The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage 
to any structure in contact with the ground in the area 
when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your 
turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit 
points, it collapses and potentially dam ages nearby 
creatures. A creature within half the distance of a 
structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. 
On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning 
damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, 
requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an 
action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher 
or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On 
a successful save, the creature takes half as much 
damage and doesn’t fall prone or becom e buried.

You cause a creature or an object you can see within 
range to grow  larger or smaller for the duration. Choose 
either a creature or an object that is neither w orn 
nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a 
Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell 
has no effect.
If the target is a creature, everything it is w earing and 
carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an 
affected creature returns to norm al size at once.
Enlarge.  The target’s size doubles in all dim ensions, 
and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth 
increases its size by one category—from  M edium to 
Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room  for the 
target to double its size, the creature or object attains 
the maximum possible size in the space available.
Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on 
Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The 
target’s w eapons also grow  to match its new  size. W hile 
these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with 
them deal 1d4 extra damage.
Reduce.  The target’s size is halved in all dim ensions, 
and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This 
reduction decreases its size by one category—from 
M edium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, 
the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks 
and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also 
shrink to match its new size. W hile these w eapons are 
reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less

Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1  minute
You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you 
can see within range to a precise location on a different 
plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, 
which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can 
orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal 
lasts for the duration.
The portal has a front and a back on each plane where 
it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only 
by m oving through its front. Anything that does so is 
instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in 
the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.
Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals 
created by this spell from  opening in their presence or 
anywhere within their domains.
W hen you cast this spell, you can speak the name 
o f a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nicknam e 
doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than 
the one you are on, the portal opens in the named 
creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature 
through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side 
of the portal. You gain no special pow er over the creature, 
and it is free to act as the DM deem s appropriate. It 
might leave, attack you, or help you.

Duration: 30 days
You place a magical com m and on a creature that you 
can see within range, forcing it to carry out som e

service or refrain from  som e action or course of activity 
as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it 
must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or becom e 
charm ed by you for the duration. W hile the creature 
is charm ed by you, it takes 5 d10 psychic damage 
each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your 
instructions, but no m ore than once each day. A  creature 
that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.

activity that would result in certain death. Should you 
issue a suicidal com m and, the spell ends.
You can end the spell early by using an action to 
dism iss it. A rem ove curse, greater restoration,  or wish  
spell also ends it.

Casting Time: 1 hour 
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (incense and pow dered diamond 
worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consum es) 
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
W hen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that 
harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as 
a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object 
that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure 
chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the 
glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 
10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object 
must remain in its place; if the object is m oved m ore 
than 10 feet from  where you cast this spell, the glyph is 
broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful 
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save 
DC to be found.
You decide what triggers the glyph w hen you cast 
the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most 
typical triggers include touching or standing on the 
glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, 
approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or 
manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. 
For glyphs inscribed within an object, the m ost com m on

triggers include opening that object, approaching within 
a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the 
glyph. O nce a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates 
only under certain circum stances or according to 
physical characteristics (such as height or weight), 
creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to 
affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also 
set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, 
such as those w ho say a certain password.
W hen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes  
or a spell glyph.
E xplosive R unes.  W hen triggered, the glyph erupts 
with m agical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered 
on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each 
creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving 
throw. A  creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or 
thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice 
when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a 
successful one.
S p ell Glyph.  You can store a prepared spell of 
3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part 
of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single 
creature or an area. The spell being stored has no 
immediate effect w hen cast in this way. W hen the glyph 
is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a 
target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph.
If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on 
that creature. If the spell sum m ons hostile creatures 
or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as 
close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the 
spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its 
full duration.
A t H igher L evels.  W hen you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an 
explosive runes  glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot 
level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph,  you can store 
any spell of up to the sam e level as the slot you use for 
the glyph o f warding.

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet 
of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 
5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The 
warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you

dividing the area am ong them, as long as you can walk

W hen you cast this spell, you can specify individuals 
that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that 
you choose. You can also specify a passw ord that, 
when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to 
these effects.
Guards and wards  creates the following effects within 
the warded area.
C orridors.  Fog fills all the warded corridors, making 
them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection 
or branching passage offering a choice of direction, 
there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than 
you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from 
the one it chooses.
D oors.  All doors in the w arded area are magically 
locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock  spell. In addition, 
you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent 
to the illusory object function of the m inor illusion  spell) 
to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
Stairs.  W ebs fill all stairs in the warded area from  top 
to bottom, as the web  spell. These strands regrow  in 10

O th er S p ell E ffect.  You can place your choice of one

of the stronghold.
•  Place dancing lights  in four corridors. You can desig­
nate a simple program  that the lights repeat as long as

of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters 
or passes through the area receives the suggestion 
mentally.

magic  cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes 
only that effect.

structure by casting this spell there every day

spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die

Duration: Until dispelled
You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that 
you can see within range. The target must succeed on 
a W isdom  saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it 
succeeds, it is im mune to this spell if you cast it again. 
W hile affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need 
to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination 
spells can’t locate or perceive the target.
W hen you cast the spell, you choose one of the 
following form s of imprisonment.
Burial.  The target is entombed far beneath the earth 
in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to 
contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, 
nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get 
into or out of it.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell is a 
small mithral orb.
Chaining.  Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, 
hold the target in place. The target is restrained until 
the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any 
means until then.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell is a 
fine chain of precious metal.
H ed ged  P rison .  The spell transports the target into 
a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation 
and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a 
cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area 
of your choice.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell is a 
miniature representation of the prison made from  jade.
M inim us Containm ent.  The target shrinks to a height 
of 1  inch and is im prisoned inside a gem stone or similar

object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally 
(allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see 
in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of 
teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut 
or broken while the spell rem ains in effect.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell 
is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum , 
diamond, or ruby.
Slumber.  The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. 
The special com ponent for this version of the spell 
consists o f rare soporific herbs.
Ending the Spell.  During the casting of the spell, 
in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that 
will cause the spell to end and release the target. The 
condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you 
choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is 
reasonable and has a likelihood of com ing to pass. The 
conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, 
or deity but otherwise must be based on observable 
actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as 
level, class, or hit points.
A  dispel magic  spell can end the spell only if it is cast 
as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the 
special com ponent used to create it.
You can use a particular special com ponent to create 
only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again 
using the sam e com ponent, the target of the first casting 
is immediately freed from  its binding.

6th-level necrom ancy
Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or som e
other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp) 
Duration: Until dispelled
Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves 
it and enters the container you used for the spell’s 
material component. W hile your soul inhabits the 
container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you 
w ere in the container’s space. You can’t move or use 
reactions. The only action you can take is to project your 
soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning 
to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting 
to possess a hum anoids body.
You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 
100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a 
protection from evil and good  or magic circle  spell can’t 
be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving 
throw. On a failure, your soul m oves into the target’s 
body, and the target’s soul becom es trapped in the 
container. On a success, the target resists your efforts 
to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again 
for 24 hours.
Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. 
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the 
creature, though you retain your alignment and your 
Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma scores. You retain 
the benefit of your own class features. If the target has 
any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.
Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can 
perceive from  the container using its own senses, but it 
can’t move or take actions at all.
W hile possessing a body, you can use your action to 
return from the host body to the container if it is within 
100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to 
its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the 
creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving 
throw against your ow n spellcasting DC. On a success, 
you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. 
Otherwise, you die.
If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your 
soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is 
m ore than 100 feet away from you or if your body is 
dead w hen you attempt to return to it, you die. If another 
creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, 
the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive 
and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.
W hen the spell ends, the container is destroyed.Ma g ic  M issile

You implant a m essage within an object in range, a 
m essage that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. 
C hoose an object that you can see and that isn’t being 
w orn or carried by another creature. Then speak the 
m essage, which must be 25 w ords or less, though it 
can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, 
determine the circum stance that will trigger the spell to 
deliver your m essage.
W hen that circum stance occurs, a m agical mouth 
appears on the object and recites the m essage in your 
voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object 
you chose has a mouth or som ething that looks like a 
mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical 
mouth appears there so that the w ords appear to com e 
from  the object’s mouth. W hen you cast this spell, you 
can have the spell end after it delivers its m essage, or 
it can remain and repeat its m essage whenever the 
trigger occurs.
The triggering circum stance can be as general or as 
detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual 
or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the 
object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to 
speak when any creature m oves within 30 feet of the 
object or w hen a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

3rd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or som e 
other visible phenom enon that is no larger than a 
20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you 
can see within range and lasts for the duration. It 
seem s completely real, including sounds, smells, and 
temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You 
can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a 
sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a 
creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a 
troglodyte’s stench).
A s long as you are within range of the illusion, you 
can use your action to cause the image to m ove to 
any other spot within range. As the im age changes 
location, you can alter its appearance so that its 
m ovements appear natural for the image. For example, 
if you create an im age of a creature and move it, you 
can alter the im age so that it appears to be walking. 
Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different 
sounds at different times, even making it carry on a 
conversation, for example.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an 
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature 
that uses its action to examine the image can determine 
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence 
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a 
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature 
can see through the image, and its other sensory 
qualities becom e faint to the creature.

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence 
or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures 
of your choice that you can see within range and that 
can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be 
charm ed are im mune to this effect. The suggestion must 
be w orded in such a manner as to make the course of 
action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab 
itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do 
som e other obviously harmful act automatically negates 
the effect of the spell.
Each target must make a W isdom  saving throw. On a 
failed save, it pursues the course of action you described 
to the best of its ability. The suggested course o f action 
can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested 
activity can be com pleted in a shorter time, the spell 
ends w hen the subject finishes what it w as asked to do.
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a 
special activity during the duration. For example, you 
might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their 
money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn’t 
met before the spell ends, the activity isn’t perform ed.
If you or any o f your com panions damage a creature

The target can use its action to attempt to escape.

Components: V, S 
Duration: 8 hours
You step into a stone object or surface large enough to 
fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the 
equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. 
Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point 
you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible 
or otherwise detectable by nonm agical senses.
W hile merged with the stone, you can’t see what 
occu rs outside it, and any W isdom  (Perception) checks 
you make to hear sounds outside it are made with 
disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of 
time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in 
the stone. You can use your movement to leave the 
stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You 
otherwise can’t move.
Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm 
you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape 
(to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you 
and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone’s 
complete destruction (or transmutation into a different 
substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage 
to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space 
closest to where you first entered.

Illusion cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet
Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: 1 minute
You create a sound or an image of an object within 
range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if 
you dism iss it as an action or cast this spell again.
If you create a sound, its volum e can range from  a 
whisper to a scream . It can be your voice, som eone 
else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any 
other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated 
throughout the duration, or you can make discrete 
sounds at different times before the spell ends.
If you create an im age of an object—such as a chair, 
muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger 
than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, 
smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction 
with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because 
things can pass through it.
If a creature uses its action to exam ine the sound or 
image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion

Duration: 10 days
You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square 
look, sound, smell, and even feel like som e other sort 
of terrain. The terrain’s general shape remains the 
same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to 
resem ble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or som e other difficult 
or im passable terrain. A  pond can be made to seem  like 
a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a 
rock-strewn gully like a wide and sm ooth road.
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, 
or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t 
disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and 
olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into 
difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise im pede 
movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory 
terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from  the 
spell’s area disappears immediately.
Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion 
to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements 
of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware ofthe illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically 
interact with the illusion.

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your 
space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with 
you and m im ic your actions, shifting position so it’s 
im possible to track which im age is real. You can use 
your action to dism iss the illusory duplicates.
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during 
the spell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the 
attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or 
higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With 
two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one 
duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A 
duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.
It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends

You attempt to reshape another creature’s m em ories. 
One creature that you can see must make a W isdom  
saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has 
advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the 
target becom es charm ed by you for the duration. The 
charm ed target is incapacitated and unaware of its 
surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any 
damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, 
and none of the target’s m em ories are modified.
W hile this charm  lasts, you can affect the target’s 
m em ory of an event that it experienced within the last 
24 hours and that lasted no m ore than 10 minutes. You 
can permanently eliminate all m em ory of the event, 
allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity 
and exacting detail, change its m em ory of the details of 
the event, or create a m em ory of som e other event.
You must speak to the target to describe how  
its m em ories are affected, and it must be able to 
understand your language for the modified m em ories to 
take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your 
description. If the spell ends before you have finished 
describing the m odified m em ories, the creature’s 
m em ory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified m em ories 
take hold w hen the spell ends.
A  m odified m em ory doesn’t necessarily affect how a 
creature behaves, particularly if the m em ory contradicts 
the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. 
An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a 
m em ory o f how  much the creature enjoyed dousing 
itself in acid, is dism issed, perhaps as a bad dream. The 
DM might deem  a modified m em ory too nonsensical to 
affect a creature in a significant manner.
A  rem ove curse  or greater restoration  spell cast on the 
target restores the creature’s true memory.

Casting Time: 1  action 
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with 
a grip and pom m el of copper and zinc, w orth 250 gp) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers 
within range. It lasts for the duration.
W hen the sword appears, you make a melee spell 
attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet o f the 
sword. On a hit. the target takes 3d10 force damage.decide the visual appearance of these servants and their 
attire. They are completely obedient to your orders.
Each servant can perform any task a norm al human 
servant could perform , but they can’t attack or take 
any action that would directly harm another creature. 
Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold 
clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on.
The servants can go anywhere in the m ansion but 
can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created 
by this spell dissipate into sm oke if removed from the 
mansion. W hen the spell ends, any creatures inside 
the extradimensional space are expelled into the open 
spaces nearest to the entrance.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each 
of your turns to move the sw ord up to 20 feet to a spot 
you can see and repeat this attack against the same 
target or a different one.

6th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag 
containing a mixture of soils—clay, loam, and sand) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 2 hours
C hoose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a 
side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay 
in the area in any m anner you choose for the duration. 
You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill 
in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The 
extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s 
largest dim ension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, 
you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower 
the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up 
to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these 
changes to complete.
At the end o f every 10 minutes you spend 
concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of 
terrain to affect.
Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, 
creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured 
by the ground’s movement.
This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or 
stone construction. R ocks and structures shift to 
accom m odate the new terrain. If the way you shape 
the terrain w ould make a structure unstable, it 
might collapse.
Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant 
growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

Duration: 24 hoursYou place an illusion on a creature or an object 
you touch so that divination spells reveal false 
information about it. The target can be a willing 
creature or an object that isn’t being carried or w orn by 
another creature.
W hen you cast the spell, choose one or both of the 
following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you 
cast this spell on the sam e creature or object every day 
for 30 days, placing the sam e effect on it each time, the 
illusion lasts until it is dispelled.
F alse Aura.  You change the way the target appears 
to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic,  
that detect magical auras. You can make a nonm agical 
object appear magical, a magical object appear 
nonm agical, or change the object’s magical aura so that 
it appears to belong to a specific school of m agic that 
you choose. W hen you use this effect on an object, you 
can make the false m agic apparent to any creature that 
handles the item.
M ask.  You change the way the target appears to spells 
and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a 
paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a sym bol  spell.

6th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)
Duration: Instantaneous
A  frigid globe of cold energy streaks from  your fingertips 
to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes 
in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the 
area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a 
failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a 
successful save, it takes half as much damage.
If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is 
principally water (not including water-based creatures), 
it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 
30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures 
that w ere sw im m ing on the surface of frozen water are 
trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action 
to make a Strength check against your spell save DC 
to break free.
You can refrain from  firing the globe after completing 
the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of 
a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand.
At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to 
can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it 
with a sling (to the sling’s norm al range). It shatters 
on impact, with the same effect as the norm al casting 
of the spell. You can also set the globe down without 
shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already 
shattered, it explodes.
A t H igher L evels.  W hen you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 
1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

A sphere of shim m ering force encloses a creature 
or object of Large size or sm aller within range. An 
unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for 
the duration.
Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell 
effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though 
a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere 
is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside 
can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from 
outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage 
anything outside it.
The sphere is w eightless and just large enough to 
contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed 
creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s 
walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature’s 
speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved 
by other creatures.
A disintegrate  spell targeting the globe destroys it 
without harming anything inside it.

its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that 
can’t be charm ed are immune to this spell.
A dancing creature must use all its movement to 
dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage 
on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. W hile 
the target is affected by this spell, other creatures 
have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an

to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage 
creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.
W hen the opening disappears, any creatures or

2nd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1  action 
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1  minute
You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a 
creature that you can see within range. The target must 
make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you 
create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible 
phenom enon of your choice that is no larger than a 
10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target 
for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead 
or constructs.
The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other 
stimuli, also evident only to the creature.
The target can use its action to examine the phantasm 
with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your 
spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes 
that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.
W hile a target is affected by the spell, the target treats 
the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes 
any illogical outcom es from  interacting with the 
phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk 
across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls 
once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the 
fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and com es up 
with som e other explanation for its fall—it w as pushed, 
it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s 
reality that it can even take damage from  the illusion. A 
phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the 
target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a 
pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on 
your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage 
to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 
feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a 
creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, 
such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage 
as a type appropriate to the illusion.

You tap into the nightm ares of a creature you can see

deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target 
must make a W isdom  saving throw. On a failed save, 
the target b ecom es frightened for the duration. At the 
start of each o f the target’s turns before the spell ends, 
the target must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw 
or take 4 d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, 
the spell ends.

of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a 
puff of sm oke if it is carried m ore than 10 feet away 
from the steed.
For the duration, you or a creature you choose can 
ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a 
riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can 
travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 m iles at a fast pace. 
W hen the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving 
the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being 
must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a dem on 
prince, or som e other being of cosm ic power. That entity 
sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to 
aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied 
space within range. If you know  a specific creature’s 
name, you can speak that name w hen you cast this spell 
to request that creature, though you might get a different 
creature anyway (D M ’s choice).
W hen the creature appears, it is under no com pulsion 
to behave in any particular way. You can ask the 
creature to perform  a service in exchange for payment, 
but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could 
range from  simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us 
fight a battle) to com plex (spy on our enemies, or protectus during our foray into the dungeon). You must be 
able to com m unicate with the creature to bargain for 
its services.
Payment can take a variety o f forms. A celestial might 
require a sizable donation of gold or m agic items to 
an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living 
sacrifice or a gift of treasure. S om e creatures might 
exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.
As a rule of thumb, a task that can be m easured in 
minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A 
task m easured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And 
a task m easured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 
gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on 
the circum stances under which you cast the spell. If the 
task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment 
might be halved or even waived. N onhazardous tasks 
typically require only half the suggested payment, while 
especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. 
Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem  suicidal.
After the creature com pletes the task, or when the 
agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature 
returns to its hom e plane after reporting back to you, 
if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are 
unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the 
creature immediately returns to its hom e plane.
A  creature enlisted to join your group counts as 
a m em ber of it, receiving a full share of experience 
points awarded.

With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an 
elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature 
must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. 
(Typically, the creature is first sum m oned into the center 
of an inverted magic circle  in order to keep it trapped 
while this spell is cast.) At the com pletion of the casting, 
the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a 
failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If 
the creature w as sum m oned or created by another spell, 
that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration 
of this spell.
A bound creature must follow  your instructions to the 
best of its ability. You might com m and the creature to 
accom pany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or 
to deliver a m essage. The creature obeys the letter of 
your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it 
strives to twist your w ords to achieve its own objectives. 
If the creature carries out your instructions completely 
before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact 
if you are on the sam e plane of existence. If you are on a 
different plane of existence, it returns to the place where 
you bound it and rem ains there until the spell ends.

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in 
a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. 
You can specify a target destination in general terms, 
such as the City o f Brass on the Elemental Plane of 
Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the 
Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination.
If you are trying to reach the City o f Brass, for example, 
you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of 
Ashes, or looking at the city from  across the Sea of Fire, 
at the DM ’s discretion.
Alternatively, if you know  the sigil sequence of a 
teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this 
spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation 
circle is too small to hold all the creatures you 
transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied 
spaces next to the circle.
You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature 
to another plane. C hoose a creature within your reach 
and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the 
creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the 
creature fails this save, it is transported to a random 
location on the plane of existence you specify. A  creature 
so transported must find its own way back to your

This spell transforms a creature that you can see 
within range into a new form. An unwilling creature 
must make a W isdom  saving throw to avoid the 
effect. A  shapechanger automatically succeeds on this 
saving throw.
The transformation lasts for the duration, or until 
the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form 
can be any beast w hose challenge rating is equal to or 
less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn't 
have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, 
including mental ability scores, are replaced by the 
statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment 
and personality.
The target assum es the hit points of its new form. 
W hen it reverts to its norm al form, the creature 
returns to the number of hit points it had before it 
transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to
0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its 
normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t 
reduce the creature’s norm al form  to 0 hit points, it isn’t 
knocked unconscious.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform  by 
the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, 
or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

Each ray is a different color and has a different pow er

make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 
to determine w hich color ray affects it.
1. Red.  The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed

6. Indigo.  On a failed save, the target is restrained.
It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the 
end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three 
times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times,
it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the 
petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t 
need to be consecutive; keep track o f both until the

it fails that save, the creature is transported to another 
plane of existence of the DM ’s choosing and is no longer 
blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t

harm. If another creature that can see the wall m oves to 
within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature

must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or becom e 
blinded for 1 minute.
The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different 
color. W hen a creature attempts to reach into or pass 
through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through 
all the w all’s layers. As it passes or reaches through 
each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving 
throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as 
described below.
The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in 
order from red to violet, by m eans specific to each layer. 
Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration 
of the spell. A  rod o f cancellation  destroys a prismatic  
wall,  but an antimagic field  has no effect on it.
1. R ed.  The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
W hile this layer is in place, nonm agical ranged attacks 
can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed 
by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
2. Orange.  The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. W hile this layer is in place, m agical ranged attacks 
can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by
a strong wind.
3. Yellow.  The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage 
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 
force damage to it.
4. G reen.  The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. A passwall  spell, or another spell of equal or 
greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, 
destroys this layer.
5. B lue.  The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire 
damage to it.
6. Indigo.  On a failed save, the creature is restrained. 
It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the 
end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three 
times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times,
it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the 
petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t 
need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the 
creature collects three of a kind.
W hile this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast 
through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light 
shed by a daylight  spell or a similar spell of equal or 
higher level.
7. Violet.  On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It 
must then make a W isdom  saving throw at the start of 
your next turn. A  successful save ends the blindness. If 
it fails that save, the creature is transported to another 
plane of the DM ’s choosing and is no longer blinded. 
(Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its 
hom e plane is banished hom e, while other creatures 
are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This 
layer is destroyed by a dispel magic  spell or a similar 
spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and 
m agical effects.Pr o d u c e  Fl a m e

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame 
remains there for the duration and harms neither you 
nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a

The spell ends if you dism iss it as an action or if you 
cast it again.
You can also attack with the flame, although doing so 
ends the spell. W hen you cast this spell, or as an action

6th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth 
at least 25 gp)
Duration: Until dispelled
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or 
som e other visible phenom enon within range that 
activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion 
is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 
30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell 
how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This 
scripted perform ance can last up to 5 minutes.
W hen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion 
springs into existence and perform s in the manner you 
described. O nce the illusion finishes perform ing, it 
disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After 
this time, the illusion can be activated again.
The triggering condition can be as general or as 
detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or 
audible conditions that occu r within 30 feet of the area. 
For example, you could create an illusion of yourself 
to appear and warn off others w ho attempt to open a 
trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only 
when a creature says the correct w ord or phrase.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an 
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature 
that uses its action to exam ine the image can determine 
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence 
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a 
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature 
can see through the image, and any noise it m akes 
sounds hollow  to the creature.

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for 
the duration. The copy can appear at any location 
within range that you have seen before, regardless of 
intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds 
like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any 
damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.
You can use your action to move this illusion up to 
twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and 
behave in whatever way you choose. It m im ics your 
m annerism s perfectly.
You can see through its eyes and hear through its 
ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus 
action, you can switch from  using its senses to using 
your own, or back again. W hile you are using its senses, 
you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own 
surroundings.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided 
that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the 
creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the 
body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures 
nonm agical diseases that affected the creature at the 
time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical 
diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first 
removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when 
the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an 
undead creature to life.
This spell closes all mortal w ounds, but it doesn’t 
restore m issing body parts. If the creature is lacking 
body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, 
for instance—the spell automatically fails.
Com ing back from  the dead is an ordeal. The target 
takes a - 4  penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 8 hours
This spell allows you to change the appearance of any 
number of creatures that you can see within range. You 
give each target you ch oose a new, illusory appearance. 
An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, 
and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
The spell disguises physical appearance as well as 
clothing, armor, w eapons, and equipment. You can make 
each creature seem  1  foot shorter or taller and appear 
thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body 
type, so you must choose a form  that has the same 
basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of 
the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, 
unless you use your action to dism iss it sooner.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to 
physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell 
to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through 
the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing 
or w ould feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use 
this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand ofsom eone w ho reaches out to touch you w ould bump into 
you while it w as seem ingly still in midair.

make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your 
spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becom es aware that the 
target is disguised.

transform into an average example o f that creature, one 
without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics 
of the chosen creature, though you retain your 
alignment and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma 
scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving 
throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the 
creature. If the creature has the sam e proficiency as you 
and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, 
use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use 
any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.
You assume the hit points and Hit D ice of the new 
form. W hen you revert to your normal form, you 
return to the number o f hit points you had before you 
transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to
0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your 
norm al form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t 
reduce your norm al form to 0 hit points, you aren’t 
knocked unconscious.
You retain the benefit o f any features from your class, 
race, or other source and can use them, provided that 
your new  form is physically capable of doing so. You 
can’t use any special senses you have (for example, 
darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. 
You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.
W hen you transform, you choose whether your 
equipment falls to the ground, m erges into the new 
form, or is w orn by it. W orn equipment functions as 
normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for 
the new  form to w ear a piece of equipment, based on 
the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t 
change shape or size to match the new form, and any 
equipment that the new form  can’t w ear must either fall 
to the ground or m erge into your new form. Equipment 
that m erges has no effect in that state.
During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to 
assume a different form  following the sam e restrictions 
and rules for the original form, with one exception: if 
your new  form  has more hit points than your current 
one, your hit points remain at their current value.

You create the im age of an object, a creature, or som e

You can use your action to cause the image to m ove to 
any spot within range. As the im age changes location, 
you can alter its appearance so that its movements 
appear natural for the image. For example, if you create 
an im age of a creature and move it, you can alter the 
im age so that it appears to be walking.
Physical interaction with the im age reveals it to be an 
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature 
that uses its action to exam ine the im age can determine 
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence 
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a 
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature

It appears to be the sam e as the original, but it has half 
the creature’s hit point maximum and is form ed without 
any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the 
statistics of the creature it duplicates.
The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you 
designate. It obeys your spoken com m ands, moving 
and acting in accordance with your w ishes and acting 
on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the 
ability to learn or becom e m ore powerful, so it never 
increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain 
expended spell slots.If the sim ulacrum  is damaged, you can repair it in an 
alchem ical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals

a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s 
abilities or m agic items, it can’t make m ore than one 
melee or ranged attack during its turn.
If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting 
time of 1  action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell 
doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the 
creature must use its action on that turn to com plete the 
spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted.

the questions you pose. The corpse must still have amouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse 
w as the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five 
questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, 
including the languages it knew. Answers are usually 
brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no 
com pulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile 
to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t 
return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating 
spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, 
doesn’t com prehend anything that has happened since it 
died, and can’t speculate about future events.

ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult 
terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and 
branches to hinder pursuers, for example.
Plants might be able to perform  other tasks on your 
behalf, at the DM ’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable 
plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they

If a plant creature is in the area, you can com m unicate 
with it as if you shared a com m on language, but you

Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
W hen you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph 
either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or 
a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal 
the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest).
If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of 
the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you 
choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if 
the object is moved m ore than 10 feet from where you 
cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends 
without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence 
(Investigation) check against your spell save 
DC to find it.
You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the 
spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical 
triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, 
removing another object covering it, approaching within 
a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object 
that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, 
the most com m on triggers are opening the object, 
approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or 
reading the glyph.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell is 
activated only under certain circum stances or according 
to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height 
or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could 
be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also 
specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as 
those w ho say a certain password.

5th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1  action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures 
or objects by thought. W hen you cast the spell, and as 
your action each round for the duration, you can exert 
your will on one creature or object that you can see 
within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You 
can affect the same target round after round, or choose 
a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior 
target is no longer affected by the spell.

C reature.  You can try to move a Huge or smaller 
creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting 
ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If 
you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet 
in any direction, including upward but not beyond the 
range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the 
creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature 
lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.
On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to 
attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature 
by repeating the contest.
O bject.  You can try to move an object that weighs 
up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being w orn or 
carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any 
direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.
If the object is w orn or carried by a creature, you must 
make an ability check with your spellcasting ability 
contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you 
succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and 
can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond 
the range of this spell.
You can exert fine control on objects with your 
telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, 
opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving 
an item from an open container, or pouring the 
contents from  a vial.

This spell instantly transports you and up to eight 
willing creatures of your choice that you can see within

can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.
The destination you choose must be known to you, 
and it must be on the sam e plane of existence asyou. Your familiarity with the destination determines 
whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls

Fam iliarity.  “Permanent circle” m eans a permanent 
teleportation circle w hose sigil sequence you know. 
“Associated object” m eans that you possess an object 
taken from the desired destination within the last six 
months, such as a book  from  a w izard’s library, bed 
linen from  a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from  a 
lich’s secret tomb.
“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a 
place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see 
when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is som eplace 
you have seen m ore than once but with w hich you aren’t 
very familiar. “Viewed on ce” is a place you have seen 
once, possibly using magic. “D escription” is a place 
w hose location and appearance you know  through 
som eone else’s description, perhaps from a map.
“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. 
Perhaps you tried to scry an enem y’s sanctum  but 
instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to 
teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.
On Target.  You and your group (or the target object) 
appear where you want to.
O ff Target.  You and your group (or the target object) 
appear a random distance away from  the destination 
in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 
1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled.
For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off 
target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d 10s, then you 
would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM 
determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a 
d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, 
and so on around the points of the com pass. If you were 
teleporting to a coastal city and w ound up 18 m iles out 
at sea, you could be in trouble.
Sim ilar A rea.  You and your group (or the target 
object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or 
thematically similar to the target area. If you are 
heading for your hom e laboratory, for example, you 
might wind up in another w izard’s laboratory or in 
an alchem ical supply shop that has many of the same 
tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, 
you appear in the closest similar place, but since the 
spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up 
anywhere on the plane.
M ishap.  The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a 
difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target 
object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on

the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps 
can occur, dealing damage each time).

Range: 10 feet
Components: V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with 
precious gem s with 50 gp, which the spell consum es) 
Duration: 1 round
As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter 
circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link 
your location to a permanent teleportation circle of 
your choice w hose sigil sequence you know  and that is 
on the sam e plane of existence as you. A  shim mering 
portal opens within the circle you drew and remains 
open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that 
enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the 
destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if 
that space is occupied.
Many m ajor temples, guilds, and other important 
places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed 
som ewhere within their confines. Each such circle 
includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical 
runes arranged in a particular pattern. W hen you first 
gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil 
sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, 
determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil 
sequences during your adventures. You can com m it 
a new  sigil sequence to m em ory after studying it 
for 1 minute.
You can create a permanent teleportation circle by 
casting this spell in the sam e location every day for one 
year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you 
cast the spell in this way.

slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change

across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it

the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.
The target assum es the hit points of its new form,

knocked unconscious.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform  by 
the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, 
or take any other action that requires hands or speech 
unless its new form  is capable of such actions.
The target’s gear melds into the new form. The 
creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit 
from any of its equipment.

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a 
point you choose within range. The wall appears in 
any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical 
barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting 
on a solid surface. You can form  it into a hemispherical 
dom e or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you 
can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by- 
10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with 
another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick.
It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a 
creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed 
to one side of the wall (your choice w hich side).
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is 
immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by dispel  
magic. A disintegrate  spell destroys the wall instantly, 
however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, 
blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. 
You can form  it into a hemispherical dom e or a sphere 
with a radius o f up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat 
surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each 
panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any 
form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it 
appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one 
side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. 
On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, 
or half as much damage on a successful save.
The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus 
breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot 
section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing 
a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and 
leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall 
occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid 
air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution 
saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A t H igher L evels.  W hen you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall 
deals w hen it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage 
from  passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 
1d6, for each slot level above 6th.

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A nonm agical wall of solid stone springs into existence 
at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches 
thick and is com posed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. 
Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other 
panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot 
panels that are only 3 inches thick.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it 
appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall 
(your choice). If a creature w ould be surrounded on all 
sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), 
that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a 
success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so 
that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it 
can’t occupy the sam e space as a creature or object.
The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm 
foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly 
supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell 
to bridge a chasm  or create a ramp.
If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you 
must halve the size of each panel to create supports.
You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, 
battlements, and so on.
The wall is an object made of stone that can be 
dam aged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 
30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel 
to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected 
panels to collapse at the DM ’s discretion.
If you maintain your concentration on this spell for 
its whole duration, the wall becom es permanent and 
can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when 
the spell ends.

Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a handful of thorns)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush 
bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears 
within range on a solid surface and lasts for the 
duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet 
long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has 
a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet 
thick. The wall blocks line of sight.
W hen the wall appears, each creature within its area 
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, 
a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much 
damage on a successful save.
A  creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly 
and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature m oves 
through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. 
Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall 
on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature mustmake a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one.
A t H igher L evels.  W hen you cast this spell using a

2nd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1  action 
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit o f spiderweb)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a m ass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of 
your choice within range. The w ebs fill a 20-foot cube 
from  that point for the duration. The w ebs are difficult 
terrain and lightly obscure their area.
If the w ebs aren’t anchored between two solid m asses 
(such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, 
or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the 
spell ends at the start of your next turn. W ebs layered 
over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
Each creature that starts its turn in the w ebs or that 
enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained 
as long as it remains in the w ebs or until it breaks free.
A creature restrained by the w ebs can use its action to 
make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it 
succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
The w ebs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of w ebs 
exposed to fire burns away in 1  round, dealing 2d4 fire 
damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, 
you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible 
only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius 
sphere centered on a point of your choice within 
range must make a W isdom  saving throw. On a failed 
save, a creature becom es frightened for the duration. 
The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, 
manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable 
threat. At the start of each of the frightened creature’s 
turns, it must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or 
take 4 d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the 
spell ends for that creature.

appearing as w isps o f cloud. W hile in this cloud form, 
a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has 
resistance to damage from  nonm agical w eapons. The 
only actions a creature can take in this form  are the 
Dash action or to revert to its norm al form. Reverting 
takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is 
incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a 
creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires 
the 1-minute transformation.
If a creature is in cloud form  and flying w hen the effect 
ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1

A  wall of strong wind rises from  the ground at a point 
you choose within range. You can make the wall up 
to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can 
shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it 
m akes one continuous path along the ground. The wall 
lasts for the duration.
W hen the wall appears, each creature within its area 
must make a Strength saving throw. A  creature takes 
3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one.
The strong wind keeps fog, sm oke, and other gases at 
bay. Sm all or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t 
pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials 
brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and 
other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind 
the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss.

9th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous
Wish  is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can 
cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very 
foundations of reality in accord with your desires.
The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other 
spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any 
requirements in that spell, including costly com ponents. 
The spell simply takes effect.
Alternatively, you can create one of the following 
effects of your choice:
•  You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that 
isn’t a m agic item. The object can be no m ore than

300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoc­
cupied space you can see on the ground.
•  You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to 
regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them 
described in the greater restoration  spell.
•  You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resis­
tance to a damage type you choose.
•  You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to 
a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For 
instance, you could m ake yourself and all your com ­
panions im mune to a lich’s life drain attack.
•  You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of 
any roll made within the last round (including your 
last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accom m odate the 
new  result. For example, a wish  spell could undo an 
opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a 
friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made 
with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose 
whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
You might be able to achieve som ething beyond the 
scop e o f the above examples. State your wish to the DM 
as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in 
ruling what occu rs in such an instance; the greater the 
wish, the greater the likelihood that som ething goes 
wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire 
might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer som e 
unforeseen consequence as a result of how  you worded 
the wish. For example, wishing that a villain w ere dead 
might propel you forward in time to a period when that 
villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from 
the game. Similarly, w ishing for a legendary m agic item 
or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence 
of the item’s current owner.
The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect 
other than duplicating another spell w eakens you. After 
enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until 
you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage 
per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or 
prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops 
to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each 
of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing 
m ore than light activity, your remaining recovery time 
decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent 
chance that you are unable to cast wish  ever again if you 
suffer this stress.

You create a m agical zone that guards against deception 
in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point o f your 
choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature 
that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn 
or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving 
throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a 
deliberate lie while in the radius. You know  whether 
each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.
An affected creature is aware o f the spell and can thus 
avoid answering questions to which it would normally 
respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in 
its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries 
of the truth.

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as 
starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching 
temperatures, can lead to a special condition called 
exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect 
can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as 
specified in the effect’s description.
Level Effect
1 Disadvantage on ability checks
2 Speed halved
3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4 Hit point maximum halved
5 Speed reduced to 0
6 Death
If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that 
causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases 
by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
A creature suffers the effect of its current level of 
exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature 
suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has 
disadvantage on ability checks.
An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as 
specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion 
effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced 
below 1.
Finishing a long rest reduces a  creature's exhaustion level 
by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some 
food and drink.

Ap p e n d ix  B: G ods  of t h e  Mu l tiv e r se
R ELIGION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE IN
t h e  worlds of the D&D multiverse. W hen 
gods w alk the world, clerics channel divine 
power, evil cults perform  dark sacrifices in 
subterranean lairs, and shining paladins 
stand like beacons against the darkness, it’s 
hard to be ambivalent about the deities and 
deny their existence.
Many people in the worlds of D&D worship different 
gods at different times and circum stances. People in 
the Forgotten Realm s, for example, might pray to Sune 
for luck in love, make an offering to W aukeen before 
heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when 
a severe storm blows in—all in the sam e day. Many 
people have a favorite am ong the gods, one w hose ideals 
and teachings they m ake their own. And a few people 
dedicate themselves entirely to a single god, usually 
serving as a priest or champion of that god’s ideals.
Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped 
in his or her campaign. From am ong the gods available, 
you can choose a single deity for your character to 
serve, worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick 
a few that your character prays to most often. Or just 
make a mental note of the gods w ho are revered in your 
DM ’s campaign so you can invoke their names when 
appropriate. If you’re playing a cleric or a character with 
the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity 
serves or served, and consider the deity’s suggested 
dom ains when selecting your character’s domain.
D&D Pa n t h e o n s
Each world in the D&D multiverse has its own 
pantheons of deities, ranging in size from the teem ing 
pantheons of the Forgotten Realm s and Greyhawk to 
the m ore focused religions of Eberron and Dragonlance. 
Many of the nonhuman races w orship the sam e gods on 
different w orlds—Moradin, for example, is revered by 
dwarves of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, and many 
other worlds.
Th e Fo r g o t t e n  Re a l m s
D ozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and feared 
throughout the world of the Forgotten Realms. At least 
thirty deities are widely known across the Realms, and 
many m ore are w orshiped locally, by individual tribes, 
small cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples.
The Life a nd Death Domains
Many deities in this section suggest the Life domain, 
particularly if they are closely associated with healing, 
protection, childbirth, nurturing, or fertility. As described in  
the chapter 3, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad, 
and a cleric of any non-evil deity can choose it.
A number of other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the 
Death domain, which is detailed in the Dungeon Master’ s  
Guide.  Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs, 
but if you want to worship a god of death, consult your 
Dungeon Master.Gr e y h a w k
The gods o f Greyhawk com e from at least four different 
pantheons, representing the faiths of the various ethnic 
groups that populated the continent of Oerik over the 
ages. As a result, there’s a great deal of overlap in their 
portfolios: Pelor is the Flan god of the sun and Pholtus 
is the Oeridian sun god, for example.
Dr a g o n l a n c e
The gods of the world of Krynn are three families: seven 
gods of good headed by Paladine and Mishakal, seven of 
neutrality headed by Gilean, and seven of evil headed by 
Takhisis and Sargonnas. These deities have been called 
by many different nam es and held in varying levels of 
esteem  by different peoples and cultures through the 
w orld’s history, but they are the only gods of this w orld— 
their place fixed in the stars as constellations.
Eb e r r o n
The w orld of Eberron has many different religions, but 
the m ost important revolves around a pantheon called 
the Sovereign Host and their malign shadow, the Dark 
Six. The gods of the Sovereign Host are thought to have 
dom inion over every aspect of existence, and to speak 
with a unified voice. But the Dark Six are the primitive, 
bloody, and cruel gods w ho offer a dissenting voice.
Eberron’s other religions are very different from  the 
traditional D&D pantheons. The monotheistic Church 
o f the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in 
the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks. 
The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity 
lies within all mortal beings and reveres the undead 
w ho have secured that immortality. Various mad cults 
are devoted to the dem ons and horrors im prisoned 
in Eberron's Underdark (called Khyber, the Dragon 
Below). The followers of the Path of Light believe that 
the w orld is heading toward a glorious future where 
the shadows that cloud this world will be transformed 
into light. And two related nations of elves revere their 
ancestral spirits: the Undying Court, preserved as 
spirits or even undead forms, and the glorified Spirits 
of the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars.

Certain gods closely associated with nonhuman races 
are revered on many different worlds, though not always 
in the sam e way. The nonhuman races of the Forgotten 
Realm s and Greyhawk share these deities.
Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of 
their own. Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf 
gods include M oradin’s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and 
a number of other gods thought to be their children 
and grandchildren: Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard, 
Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, G orm  Gulthyn, 
Haela Brightaxe, M arthamm or Duin, Sharindlar, Thard 
Harr, and Vergadain. Individual clans and kingdom s of 
dwarves might revere som e, all, or none of these deities, 
and som e have other gods unknown (or known by other 
names) to outsiders.

The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and N orse pantheons are 
fantasy interpretations of historical religions from  our 
w orld’s ancient times. They include deities that are 
m ost appropriate for use in a D&D game, divorced from 
their historical context in the real world and united into 
pantheons that serve the needs of the game.
Th e Ce l t i c  Pa n t h e o n
It’s said that som ething wild lurks in the heart of every 
soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling 
at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to 
the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak—and it is in 
this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from 
the brook and stream, their might heightened by the 
strength of the oak and the beauty of the w oodlands and 
open moor. W hen the first forester dared put a name to 
the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling 
in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.
The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by 
clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of 
nature that druids revere.
Th e Gr e e k  Pa n t h e o n
The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the 
gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of 
the thunder am ong the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The 
thick boar-infested w oods and the sere, olive-covered 
hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect 
of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made 
a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.
Th e Eg y p t i a n  Pa n t h e o n
T hese gods are a young dynasty o f an ancient divine 
family, heirs to the rulership of the cosm os and the 
maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at—the 
fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that 
puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and 
w om en in their logical and rightful place in the universe.
The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three 
gods with the Death dom ain o f different alignments. 
Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, whoFa n t a s y - His t o r ic a l  Pa n t h e o n s

judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god 
of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother 
Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of 
mourning. Thus, although m ost clerics of the Death 
domain (found in the Dungeon Master's Guide)  are 
villainous characters, clerics w ho serve Anubis or 
Nephthys need not be.
Th e No r s e  Pa n t h e o n
W here the land plummets from  the snowy hills into the 
icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the 
beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with 
every fall and spring—this is the land of the Vikings, 
the hom e of the N orse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, 
and one that calls for brutal living. The w arriors of 
the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in 
order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted bythe needs of their environment. Given the necessity of 
raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals 
turned out as well as they did. Their pow ers reflect 
the need these w arriors had for strong leadership and 
decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every 
bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder 
and the boom ing of the glaciers, and smell them in the 
sm oke of a burning longhouse.
The N orse pantheon includes two main families, the 
Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods 
of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two 
fam ilies are now  closely allied against their com m on 
enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and 
Thrym). Like the gods of Greyhawk, gods in different 
fam ilies som etim es have overlap in their spheres of 
influence: Frey (of the Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir) 
are both associated with the sun, for example.

Ap p e n d ix  C : T h e Pl a n e s  o f Ex is t e n c e
I NCREDIBLY VAST IS THE COSMOS OF THE
Du n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game, which teems 
with a multitude o f worlds as well as myriad 
alternate dim ensions of reality, called the planes  
of existence. It encom passes every world 
where Dungeon Masters run their adventures, 
all within the relatively mundane realm of the 
Material Plane. Beyond that plane are dom ains 
of raw elemental matter and energy, realm s of pure 
thought and ethos, the hom es of dem ons and angels, 
and the dom inions of the gods.
Many spells and m agic items can draw energy 
from these planes, sum m on the creatures that dwell 
there, com m unicate with their denizens, and allow 
adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves 
greater pow er and higher levels, you might undertake 
a quest to rescue a friend from the horrific depths of 
the Abyss, or find yourself hoisting a tankard with the 
friendly giants of Ysgard. You might w alk on streets 
made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield 
where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.
The M a t e r ia l  Pla n e
The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical 
and elemental forces that define the other planes collide 
in the jum bled existence of mortal life and mundane 
matter. All the worlds of D&D exist within the Material 
Plane, making it the starting point for m ost cam paigns 
and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in 
relation to the Material Plane.
The w orlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, 
for they reflect the creative imagination of the DMs 
w ho set their gam es there, as well as the players w hose 
heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted 
desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds 
where m agic com bines with advanced technology and 
others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where 
the gods w alk and places they have abandoned.The best-known w orlds in the multiverse are the 
ones that have been published as official cam paign 
settings for the D&D game over the years—Greyhawk, 
Blackm oor, Dragonlance, the Forgotten Realms, 
Mystara, Birthright, Dark Sun, and Eberron, am ong 
others. Each of these w orlds boasts its own cast of 
heroic adventurers and schem ing villains, its own 
ancient ruins and forgotten artifacts, its own dungeons 
and its own dragons. But if your cam paign takes place 
on one of these worlds, it belongs to your DM—you 
might imagine it as one of thousands of parallel versions 
of the world, which might diverge wildly from  the 
published version.
Ma t e r i a l  Ec h o e s
The Material Plane is a richly m agical place, and its 
magical nature is reflected in the two planes that share 
its central place in the multiverse. The Feywild and the 
Shadowfell are parallel dim ensions occupying the sam e 
cosm ological space, so they are often called echo planes 
or mirror planes to the Material Plane. The w orlds and 
landscapes of these planes mirror the natural world 
of the Material Plane but reflect those features into 
different form s—m ore marvelous and magical in the 
Feywild, distorted and colorless in the Shadowfell. 
W here a volcano stands in the Material Plane, a 
mountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that 
glow  with internal fire towers in the Feywild, and a 
jagged rock outcropping resem bling a skull marks the 
spot on the Shadowfell.
The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land 
of soft lights and wonder, a country o f little people with 
great desires, a place of music and death. It is a realm 
of eternal twilight, with slow  lanterns bobbing in the 
gentle breeze and huge fireflies buzzing through groves 
and fields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of 
the setting, or perhaps rising, sun. But, in fact, the sun 
never truly sets or rises; it remains stationary, dusky 
and low  in the sky. Away from the settled areas ruled by 
the Seelie Court, the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed 
bram bles and syrupy fens—perfect territory for the 
Unseelie to hunt their prey. Fey creatures, such as those 
brought to the world by conjure woodland beings  and 
similar spells, dwell in the Feywild.
The Shadowfell, also called the Plane o f Shadow, is 
a darkly lighted dimension, a world of black and white 
where color has been leached from  everything. It is a 
place of toxic darkness that hates the light, where the 
sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.
Po s it iv e  a n d  N e g a t iv e  Pl a n e s
Like a dome above the other planes, the Positive Plane is the 
source of radiant energy and the raw life force that suffuses 
all living beings, from the puny to the sublime. Its dark 
reflection is the Negative Plane, the source of necrotic energy 
that destroys the living and animates the undead.

Be yo n d  t h e  Ma t e r ia l
Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of 
existence are realm s of myth and mystery. They’re 
not simply other worlds, but different qualities of 
being, form ed and governed by spiritual and elemental 
principles abstracted from  the ordinary world.
Pl a n a r  Tr a v e l
W hen adventurers travel into other planes of existence, 
they are undertaking a legendary journey across the 
thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where 
they strive to com plete their quest. Such a journey is the 
stuff of legend. Braving the realm s of the dead, seeking 
out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with 
an efreeti in its hom e city will be the subject of song and 
story for years to com e.
Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be 
accom plished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using 
a planar portal.
S pells.  A  number of spells allow direct or indirect 
access to other planes of existence. Plane shift  and 
gate  can transport adventurers directly to any other 
plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. 
Etherealness  allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal 
Plane and travel from  there to any of the planes it 
touches—the Shadowfell, the Feywild, or the Elemental 
Planes. And the astral projection  spell lets adventurers 
project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to 
the Outer Planes.
P ortals. A  portal is a general term for a stationary 
interplanar connection that links a specific location 
on one plane to a specific location on another. Som e 
portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog- 
shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it 
effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations— 
circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, 
or even whole tow ns—that exist in multiple planes at 
once or flicker from  one plane to another in turn. Som e 
are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a 
very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the 
heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane o f Fire) or the 
depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).
Tr a n s i t i v e  P l a n e s
The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the 
Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms 
that serve primarily as ways to travel from  one plane 
to another. Spells such as etherealness  and astral  
projection  allow characters to enter these planes and 
traverse them to reach the planes beyond.
The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dim ension 
that is som etim es described as a great ocean. Its shores, 
called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane 
and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those 
planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal 
Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border 
Ethereal, and the see invisibility  and true seeing  spell 
grant that ability. Som e magical effects also extend from 
the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly 
effects that use force energy such as forcecage  and wallo f force.  The depths of the plane, the D eep Ethereal, are 
a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.
The Astral Plane is the realm o f thought and dream, 
where visitors travel as disem bodied souls to reach 
the planes of the divine and dem onic. It is a great, 
silvery sea, the sam e above and below, with swirling 
w isps of white and gray streaking am ong motes of light 
resem bling distant stars. Erratic w hirlpools of color 
flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of 
solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral 
Plane is an endless, open domain.
In n e r  Pl a n e s
The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material 
Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental 
substance from  which all the w orlds w ere made. The 
four Elemental Planes— Air, Earth, Fire, and Water— 
form  a ring around the Material Plane, suspended 
within the churning Elemental Chaos.
At their innerm ost edges, where they are closest 
to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal 
geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes 
resem ble a world in the Material Plane. The four 
elements mingle together as they do in the Material 
Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from  the 
Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both 
alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their 
purest form —great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, 
crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions 
are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, 
for example, a speaker usually m eans just the border 
region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, 
the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an 
unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding 
substance, the Elemental Chaos.
Ou t e r  Pl a n e s
If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that 
m akes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the 
direction, thought and purpose for such construction. 
Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as 
divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the 
Outer Planes are best known as the hom es of deities.
W hen discussing anything to do with deities, the 
language used must be highly metaphorical. Their 
actual hom es are not literally “places” at all, but 
exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realm s of 
thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one 
can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as 
a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions 
lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.
Even in those perceptible regions, appearances 
can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes 
appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the 
Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the 
w him s of the powerful forces that live on the Outer 
Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on 
these planes can remake them completely, effectively 
erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill 
their own needs.

Distance is a virtually m eaningless concept on the 
Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes 
often seem  quite small, but they can also stretch on to 
what seem s like infinity. It might be possible to take 
a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from  the first layer to 
the ninth, in a single day—if the pow ers of the Hells 
desire it. Or it could take w eeks for travelers to make a 
grueling trek across a single layer.
The m ost well-known Outer Planes are a group of 
sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments 
(excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction 
between them.

The planes with som e element of good in their nature 
are called the Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such 
as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes 
with som e element of evil are the Lower Planes. Fiends 
such as dem ons, devils, and yugoloths dwell in the 
Low er Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and 
a character w hose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s 
experiences a profound sense of dissonance there.
W hen a good creature visits Elysium, for example, it 
feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels 
out o f tune and m ore than a little uncomfortable.
Ot h e r  Pl a n e s
Existing som ehow  between or beyond the known planes 
of existence are a variety of other realms.
Sig il  a n d  t h e  O u t l a n d s
The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes, a 
plane of neutrality, but not the neutrality o f nothingness. 
Instead it incorporates a little of everything, keeping it 
all in a paradoxical balance—simultaneously concordant 
and in opposition. It is a broad region of varied terrain, 
with open prairies, towering mountains, and twisting, 
shallow rivers, strongly resembling an ordinary world 
of the Material Plane.
The Outlands is circular, like a great w heel—in fact, 
those w ho envision the Outer Planes as a w heel point 
to the Outlands as proof, calling it a m icrocosm  of theplanes. That argument might be circular, however, 
for it is possible that the arrangement of the Outlands 
inspired the idea of the Great W heel in the first place.
Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, 
are the gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built 
around a portal leading to one o f the Outer Planes. Each 
town shares many of the characteristics of the plane 
where its gate leads.
At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of the 
planar wheel, the Spire shoots im possibly high into the 
sky. Above this thin peak floats the ring-shaped city of 
Sigil, the City o f D oors. This bustling planar m etropolis 
holds countless portals to other planes and worlds.
Sigil is a trader’s city. G oods, merchandise, and 
information com e to it from  across the planes. There 
is a brisk trade in information about the planes, in 
particular in the com m and w ords or items required for 
the operation of particular portals. These portal keys 
are highly sought after, and many travelers within the 
city are looking for a particular portal or a portal key 
to allow them to continue on their way.
De m ip l a n e s
Dem iplanes are small extradim ensional spaces with 
their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that 
don’t seem  to fit anywhere else. Dem iplanes com e 
into being by a variety o f means. S om e are created by 
spells, such as demiplane,  or generated at the desire of a 
pow erful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, 
as a fold o f existing reality that has been pinched off 
from  the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe 
growing in power. A  given demiplane can be entered 
through a single point where it touches another plane. 
Theoretically, a plane shift  spell can also carry travelers 
to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required 
for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The 
gate  spell is m ore reliable, assum ing the caster knows 
o f the demiplane.
Th e Fa r Re a l m
The Far Realm  is beyond the known multiverse. In fact, 
it might be an entirely separate multiverse with its own 
physical and magical laws. W here stray energies from 
the Far Realm  leak onto another plane, life and matter 
are w arped and twisted into alien shapes that defy 
ordinary geom etry and biology.
The entities that abide in the Far Realm  are too alien 
for a normal mind to accept without damage. Titanic 
creatures sw im  through nothingness, preoccupied 
with m adness. Unspeakable things w hisper awful 
truths to those w ho dare listen. For mortals, knowledge 
of the Far Realm  is a triumph of mind over the rude 
boundaries of matter, space, and eventually sanity.
There are no known portals to the Far Realm, or 
at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once 
pierced the boundary o f eons with a vast portal to the 
Far Realm  within a mountain called Firestorm Peak, 
but their civilization im ploded in bloody terror and 
the portal’s location—even its hom e w orld—is long- 
forgotten. Other portals might still exist, marked by the 
alien forces leaking through to corrupt the Material 
Plane around them.

App e n d ix  E: I n s p ir a t io n a l  Re a d in g
I NSPIRATION FOR ALL OF THE FANTASY WORK I HAVE
done stems directly from the love my father  
showed when I was a lad, for he spent many  
hours telling me stories he made up as he went  
along, tales o f cloaked old men who could grant  
wishes, of magic rings and enchanted swords,  
or wicked sorcerers and dauntless swordsmen. .
.. All o f us tend to get ample helpings of fantasy  
when we are very young, from fairy tales such as those  
written by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang.
This often leads to reading books of mythology, paging  
through bestiaries, and consultation of compilations  
of the myths o f various lands and peoples. Upon such  
a base I built my interest in fantasy, being an avid  
reader o f all science fiction and fantasy literature  
since 1950. The following authors were o f particular  
inspiration to me.

4 INTRODUCTION 
r T'S GOOD TO BE THE DUNGEON MASTER! NOT ONLY 
d? y~u get to tell fantastic stories about heroes, 
v1llams, monsters , and magic, but you also get 
to create the world in which these stories live. 
Whether you're running a D&D game already 
or you think it's something you want to try, this 
book is for you. 
The Dungeon Master's Guide assumes that you know 
the basics of how to play the D&D tabletop roleplaying 
game. If you haven't played before, the DuNGEONS f!f> 
DRAGONS Starter Set is a great starting point for new 
players and DMs. 
This book has two important companions : the Player's 
Handbook , which contains the rules your players need 
to create characters and the rules you need to run the 
game, and the Monster Manual, which contains ready-to­
use monsters to populate your D&D world. 
THE DUNGEON MASTER 
The Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force 
behind a D&D game. The DM creates a world for the 
other players to explore, and also creates and runs 
adventures that drive the story. An adventure typically 
hinges on the successful completion of a quest, and 
can be as short as a single game session. Longer 
adventures might embroil players in great conflicts that 
require multiple game sessions to resolve. When strung 
together, these adventures form an ongoing campaign. 
A D&D campaign can include dozens of adventures and 
last for months or years. 
A Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats. As the 
architect of a campaign , the DM creates adventures 
by placing monsters, traps, and treasures for the other 
players' characters (the adventurers) to discover. As 
a storyteller, the DM helps the other players visualize 
what's happening around them, improvising when the 
adventurers do something or go somewhere unexpected. 
As an actor, the DM plays the roles of the monsters and 
supporting characters, breathing life into them. And as a 
referee, the DM interprets the rules and decides when to 
abide by them and when to change them. 
Inventing, writing, storytelling , improvising, acting, 
refereeing-every DM handles these roles differently , 
and you'll probably enjoy some more than others. It 
helps to remember that DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is a 
hobby, and being the DM should be fun. Focus .on the 
aspects you enjoy and downplay the rest. For example , if 
you don't like creating your own adventures , you can use 
published ones. You can also lean on the other players 
to help you with rules mastery and world-building. 
The D&D rules help you and the other players have 
a good time, but the rules aren't in charge. You're the 
DM, and you are in charge of the game. That said, your 
goal isn't to slaughter the adventurers but to create a 
campaign world that revolves around their actions and 
decisions, and to keep your players coming back for 
more! If you're lucky, the events of your campaign will 
echo in the memories of your players long after the final 
game session is concluded. 
INTRODUCTION How TO UsE THIS BooK 
This book is organized in three parts. The first part 
helps you decide what kind of campaign you'd like to 
run. The second part helps you create the adventures ­
the stories-that will compose the campaign and 
keep the players entertained from one game session 
to the next. The last part helps you adjudicate the 
rules of the game and modify them to suit the style of 
your campaign. 
PART 1: MASTER OF WORLDS 
Every DM is the creator of his or her own campaign 
world. Whether you invent a world, adapt a world from 
a favorite movie or novel, or use a published setting for 
the D&D game, you make that world your own over the 
course of a campaign . 
The world where you set your campaign is one of 
countless worlds that make up the D&D multiverse , 
a vast array of planes and worlds where adventures 
happen. Even if you're using an established world such 
as the Forgotten Realms, your campaign takes place 
in a sort of mirror universe of the official setting where 
Forgotten Realms novels, game products , and digital 
games are assumed to take place. The world is yours to 
change as you see fit and yours to modify as you explore 
the consequences of the players' actions. 
Your world is more than just a backdrop for 
adventures. Like Middle Earth, Westeros , and countless 
other fantasy worlds out there, it's a place to which you 
can escape and witness fantastic stories unfold. A well­
designed and well-run world seems to flow around the 
adventurers , so that they feel part of something , instead 
of apart from it. 
Consistency is a key to a believable fictional 
world. When the adventurers go back into town for 
supplies, they should encounter the same nonplayer 
characters .(NPCs) they met before. Soon, they'll learn 
the barkeep's name, and he or she will remember 
theirs as well. Once you have achieved this degree of 
consistency , you can provide an occasional change. If 
the adventurers come back to buy more horses at the 
stables, they might discover that the man who ran the 
place went back home to the large city over the hills, 
and now his niece runs the family business. That sort of· 
change-one that has nothing to do with the adventurers 
directly, but one that they'll notice-makes the players 
feel as though their characters are part of a living world 
that changes and grows along with them. 
Part 1 of this book is all about inventing your world. 
Chapter 1 asks what type of game you want to run, and 
helps you nail down a few important details about your 
world and its overarching conflicts . Chapter 2 helps you 
put your world in the greater context of the multiverse, 
expanding on the information presented in the Player's 
Handbook to discuss the planes of existence and the 
gods and how you can put them together to serve the 
needs of your campaign. 
PART 2: MASTER OF ADVENTURES 
Whether you write your own adventures or use 
published ones, expect to invest preparation time 
beyond the hours you spend at the gaming table. You'll 
need to carve out some free time to exercise your 
creativity as you invent compelling plots, create new 
NPCs, craft encounters , and think of clever ways to 
foreshadow story events yet to come. 
Part 2 of this book is devoted to helping you create 
and run great adventures. Chapter 3 covers the basic 
elements of a D&D adventure , and chapter 4 helps you 
create memorable NPCs. Chapter 5 presents guidelines 
and advice for running adventures set in dungeons, 
the wilderness, and other locales, and chapter 6 covers 
the time between adventures . Chapter 7 is all about 
treasure , magic items, and special rewards that help 
keep the players invested in your campaign. 
PART 3: MASTER OF RULES 
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS isn't a head-to-head competit ion, 
but it needs someone who is impartial yet involved in the 
game to guarantee that everyone at the table plays by the 
rules. As the player who creates the game world and the 
adventures that take place within it, the DM is a natural 
fit to take on the referee role. · 
As a referee, the DM acts as a mediator between the 
rules and the players. A player tells the DM what he or 
she wants to do, and the DM determines whether it is 
successful or not, in some cases asking the player to 
make a die roll to determine success. For example, if a 
player wants his or her character to take a swing at an 
ore, you say, "Make an attack roll" while looking up the 
ore's Armor Class. 
The rules don't account for every possible situation 
that might arise during a typical D&D session. For example , a player might want his or her character to 
hurl a brazier full of hot coals into a monster's face. 
How you determine the outcome of this action is up to 
you. You might tell the player to make a Strength check, 
while mentally setting the Difficulty Class (DC) at 15. 
If the Strength check is successful , you then determine 
how a face full of hot coals affects the monster. You 
might decide that it deals ld4 fire damage and imposes 
disadvantage on the monster's attack rolls until the end 
of its next turn. You roll the damage die (or let the player 
do it), and the game continues. 
Sometimes mediating the rules means setting limits. 
If a player tells you, "I want to run up and attack the 
ore," but the character doesn't have enough movement 
to reach the ore, you say, "It's too far away to move up 
and still attack. What would you like to do instead?" 
The player takes the information and comes up with a 
different plan. 
To referee the rules, you need to know them. You don't 
have to memorize this book or the Player's Handbook , 
but you should have a clear idea of their contents so that, 
when a situation requires a ruling, you know where to 
find the proper reference. 
The Player's Handbook contains the main rules you 
need to play the game. Part 3 of this book offers a wealth 
of information to help you adjudicate the rules in a wide 
variety of situations. Chapter 8 presents advice for using 
attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. It also 
includes options appropriate for certain play styles and 
campaigns , including guidelines for using miniatures , 
a system for handling chase scenes, and rules for 
madness. If you like to create your own stuff, such 
as new monsters, races, and character backgrounds , 
chapter 9 shows you how. That chapter also contains 
optional rules for unusual situations or play styles, such 
as the use of firearms in a fantasy setting. 
INTRODUCTION 
5 
KNow YouR PLAYERS 
The success of a D&D game hinges on your ability to 
entertain the other players at the game table. Whereas 
their role is to create characters (the protagonists of 
the campaign), breathe life into them, and help steer 
the campaign through their characters ' actions, your 
role is to keep the players (and yourself) interested and 
immersed in the world you've created, and to let their 
characters do awesome things. 
Knowing what your players enjoy most about the 
D&D game helps you create and run adventures that 
they will enjoy and remember. Once you know which of 
the following activities each player in your group enjoys 
the most, you can tailor adventures that satisfy your 
players' preferences as much as possible, thus keeping 
them engaged. 
ACTING 
Players who enjoy acting like getting into character 
and speaking in their characters ' voices. Roleplayers 
at heart, they enjoy social interactions with NPCs, 
monsters, and their fellow party members. 
Engage players who like acting by ... 
giving them opportunities to develop their characters' 
personalities and backgrounds. 
• allowing them to interact regularly with NPCs. 
adding roleplaying elements to combat encounters . 
incorporating elements from their characters' back­
grounds into your adventures. 
ExPLORING 
Players who desire exploration want to experience the 
wonders that a fantasy world has to offer. They want to 
know what's around the next corner or hill. They also 
like to find hidden clues and treasure. 
Engage players who like exploration by ... 
dropping clues that hint at things yet to come. 
letting them find things when they take the time 
to explore. 
providing rich descriptions of exciting environments , 
and using interesting maps and props. 
• giving monsters secrets to uncover or cultural 
details to learn. 
INSTIGATING 
Player's who like to instigate action are eager to make 
things happen, even if that means taking perilqus risks. 
They would rather rush headlong into danger and face 
the consequences than face boredom. 
Engage players who like to instigate by ... 
allowing them to affect their surroundings. 
• including things in your adventures to tempt them. 
letting their actions put the characters in a tight spot. 
including encounters with NPCs who are as feisty and 
unpredictable as they are. 
INTRODUCTTON FIGHTING 
Players who enjoy fantasy combat like kicking the 
tar out of villains and monsters. They look for any 
excuse to start a fight, favoring bold action over careful 
deliberation. 
Engage players who like fighting by ... 
• springing unexpected combat encounters on them. 
vividly describing the havoc their characters wreak 
with their attacks and spells. 
including combat encounters with large numbers of 
weak monsters. 
• interrupting social interaction and exploration 
with combat. 
OPTIMIZING 
Players who enjoy optimizing their characters ' 
capabilities like to fine-tune their characters for peak 
combat performance by gaining levels, new features, 
and magic items. They welcome any opportunity to 
demonstrate their characters' superiority . 
Engage players who like optimization by ... 
ensuring steady access to new abilities and spells. 
• using desired magic items as adventure hooks. 
including encounters that let their characters shine. 
providing quantifiable rewards, like experience points, 
for noncombat encounters .

• occasionally allowing a smart plan to grant an easy 
win for the players.

STORYTELLING 
Players who love storytelling want to contribute to a 
narrative. They like it when their characters are heavily 
invested in an unfolding story, and they enjoy encounters 
that are tied to and expand an overarching plot. 
Engage players who like storytelling by ... 
using their characters' backgrounds to help shape the 
stories of the campaign. 
• making sure an encounter advances the story 
in some way. 
• making their characters' actions help steer 
future events. 
giving NPCs ideals, bonds, and flaws that the adven­
turers can exploit. 
PART1 
Master of Worlds 
• • • • • 

OUR WORLD IS THE SETTING FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN , 
the place where adventures happen. Even 
if you use an existing setting, such as the 
Forgotten Realms, it becomes yours as you 
set your adventures there, create characters 
to inhabit it, and make changes to it over 
the course of your campaign. This chapter is all about 
building your world and then creating a campaign to 
take place in it. 
THE BIG PICTURE 
This book, the Player's Handbook , and the Monster 
Manual present the default assumptions for how the 
worlds of D&D work. Among the established settings of 
D&D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, 
and Mystara don't stray very far from those 
assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, 
Raven loft, Spelljammer , and Planescape venture further 
away from that baseline. As you create your own world, 
it's up to you to decide where on the spectrum you want 
your world to fall. 
CoRE AssuMPTIONS ______ _ 
The rules of the game are based on the following core 
assumptions about the game world. 
Gods Oversee the World. The gods are real and 
embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming 
dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, 
forests, or the sea. Gods exert influence over the world 
by granting divine magic to their followers and sending 
signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a god 
serves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent 
seeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its 
rivals. While some folk might refuse to honor the gods, 
none can deny their existence. 
Much of the World Is Untamed. Wild regions 
abound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms 
of various sizes dot the Ia ndscape, but beyond their 
borders the wilds crowd in. People know the area they 
live in well. They've heard stories of other places from 
merchants and travelers, but few know what lies beyond 
the mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless 
they've been there themselves. 
The World Is Ancient. Empires rise and fall, leaving 
few places that have not been touched by imperial 
grandeur or decay. War, time, and natural forces 
eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with 
places of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations 
and their knowledge survive in legends, magic 
items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an 
empire's collapse. 
Conflict Shapes the World's History. Powerful 
individuals strive to make their mark on the world, and 
factions of like-minded individuals can alter the course 
of history. Factions include religions led by charismatic 
prophets , kingdoms ruled by lasting dynasties, and 
shadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic. 
The influence of such factions waxes and wanes as they compete with each other for power. Some seek to 
preserve the world and usher in a golden age. Others 
strive toward evil ends, seeking to rule the world with 
an iron fist. Still others seek goals that range from 
the practical to the esoteric, such as the accumulation 
of material wealth or the resurrection of a dead god. 
Whatever their goals, these factions inevitably collide, 
creating conflict that can steer the world's fate. 
The World Is Magical. Practitioners of magic are 
relatively few in number, but they leave evidence of 
their craft everywhere. The magic can be as innocuous 
and commonplace as a potion that heals wounds to 
something much more rare and impressive, such as a 
levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates 
of a city. Beyond the realms of civilization are caches 
of magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as 
magically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters 
created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with 
magical abilities.

In creating your campaign world, it helps to start with 
the core assumptions and consider how your setting 
might change them. The subsequent sections of this 
chapter address each element and give details on how to 
flesh out your world with gods, factions, and so forth. 
The assumptions sketched out above aren't carved 
in stone. They inspire exciting D&D worlds full of 
adventure , but they're not the only set of assumptions 
that can do so. You can build an interesting campaign 
concept by altering one or more of those core 
assumptions , just as well-established D&D worlds have 
done. Ask yourself, "What if the standard assumptions 
weren't true in my world?" 
The World Is a Mundane Place. What if magic is rare 
and dangerous, and even adventurers have limited or no 
access to it? What if your campaign is set in a version of 
our own world's history? 
The World Is New. What if your world is new, and 
the characters are the first of a long line of heroes? 
The adventurers might be champions of the first 
great empires, such as the empires of Netheril and 
Cormanthor in the Forgotten Realms setting. 
The World Is Known. What if the world is completely 
charted and mapped, right down to the "Here there be 
dragons" notations? What if great empires cover huge 
stretches of countryside , with clearly defined borders 
between them? The Five Nations of the Eberron setting 
were once part of a great empire, and magically aided 
travel between its cities is commonplace . 
Monsters Are Uncommo"n. What if monsters are 
rare and terrifying? In the Ravenloft setting, horrific 
domains are governed by monstrous rulers. The 
populace lives in perpetual terror of these darklords 
and their evil minions, but other monsters rarely trouble 
people's daily lives. 
Magic Is Everywhere. What if every town is ruled 
by a powerful wizard? What if magic item shops are 
common? The Eberron setting makes the use of magic

trains carry travelers from one great city to another. 
Gods Inhabit the Land, or Are Entirely Absent. 
What if the gods regularly walk the earth? What if the 
characters can challenge them and seize their power? 
Or what if the gods are remote, and even angels never 
make contact with mortals? In the Dark Sun setting, the 
gods are extreme ly distant-perhaps nonexistent-and 
clerics rely instead on elemental power for their magic.

Appendix B of the Player's Handbook presents a 
number of pantheons (loose groupings of deities not 
united by a single doctrine or philosophy) for use in your 
game, including the gods of established D&D worlds 
and fantasy-historical pantheons. You can adopt one of 
these pantheons for your campaign, or pick and choose 
deities and ideas from them as you please. See "A 
Sample Pantheon" in this section for an example. 
As far as the game's rules are concerned, it doesn't 
matter if your world has hundreds of deities or a church 
devoted to a single god. In rules terms, clerics choose 
domains, not deities, so your world can associate 
domains with deities in any way you choose. 
LOOSE PANTHEONS 
Most D&D worlds have a loose pantheon of gods. 
A multitude of deities rule the various aspects of 
existence, variously cooperating with and competing 
against one another to administer the affairs of the 
universe. People gather in public shrines to worship 
gods of life and wisdom, or meet in hidden places to 
venerate gods of deception or destruction. 
Each deity in a pantheon has a portfolio and is 
responsib le for advancing that portfolio. In the 
Greyhawk setting, Heironeous is a god of valor who

CHAPTER I I A WORLD Of YOUR OWN calls clerics and paladins to his service and encourages 
them to spread the ideals of honorable warfare, 
chivalry, and justice in society. Even in the midst of his 
everlasting war with his brother Hextor, god of war and 
tyranny, Heironeous promotes his own portfolio: war 
fought nobly and in the cause of justice. 
People in most D&D worlds are polytheistic, honoring 
deities of their own and acknowledging pantheons of 
other cultures. Individuals pay homage to various gods, 
regardless of alignment. In the Forgotten Realms, a 
person might propitiate Umberlee before setting out 
to sea, join a communal feast to celebrate Chauntea at 
harvest time, and pray to Malar before going hunting. 
Some individuals feel a calling to a particular deity's 
service and claim that god as a patron. Particularly 
devoted individuals become priests by setting up a 
shrine or helping to staff a holy site. Much more rarely, 
those who feel such a calling become clerics or paladins 
invested with the responsibility of true divine power. 
Shrines and temples serve as community gathering 
points for religious rites and festivals. Priests at such 
sites relate stories of the gods, teach the ethics of their 
patron deities, offer advice and blessings, perform 
religious rites, and provide training in activities their 
deities favor. Cities and large towns can host several 
temples dedicated to individual gods important to the 
community, while smaller settlements might have a 
single shrine devoted to any gods the locals revere. 
To quickly build a pantheon for your world, crea~e 
a single god for each of the eight domains available 
to clerics: Death, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, 
Tempest , Trickery, and War. You can invent names 
and personalities for these deities, or borrow deities 
from other pantheons. This approach gives you a small 
pantheon that covers the most significant aspects of 
existence, and it's easy enough to extrapolate other 
areas of life each deity controls. The god of Knowledge,

and the god of time. 
A SAMPLE PANTHEO N 
The pantheon of the Dawn War is an example of a 
pantheon assembled from mostly preexisting elements 
to suit the needs of a particular campaign. This is 
the default pantheon in the fourth edition Player's 
Handbook (2008). The pantheon is summarized in the 
Dawn War Deities table. 
This pantheon draws in several nonhuman deities 
and establishes them as universal gods. These gods 
include Bahamut, Corellon , Gruumsh, Lolth, Moradin, 
Sehanine, and Tiamat. Humans worship Moradin and 
Corell on as gods of their respective portfolios, rather 
than as racial deities. The pantheon also includes the 
archdevil Asmodeus as god of domination and tyranny. 
Several of the gods are drawn from other pantheons, 
sometimes with new names for the gods. Bane comes 
from the Forgotten Realms. From Greyhawk come 
Kord, Pelor, Tharizdun, and Vecna. From the Greek 
pantheon come Athena (renamed Era this) and Tyche 
(renamed Avandra), though both are altered. Set 
(renamed Zehir) comes from the Egyptian pantheon. 
The Raven Queen is akin to the Norse pantheon's He! 
and Greyhawk's Weejas. That leaves three gods created 
from scratch: Ioun, Melora, and Torog: 
OTHER RELIGIOUS SYSTEMS 
In your campaign, you can create pantheons of gods 
who are closely linked in a single religion, monotheistic 
religions (worship of a single deity), dualistic systems 
(centered on two opposing deities or forces), mystery 
cults (involving personal devotion to a single deity, 
usually as part of a pantheon system), anjmistic 
religions (revering the spirits inherent in nature), or 
even forces and philosophies that don't center on deities. 
TIGHT PANTHEONS 
In contrast to a loose pantheon , a tight pantheon focuses 
on a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace 
a small group of deities. Followers of a tight pantheon 
might favor one of its member deities over another, 
but they respect all the deities and honor them with 
sacrifices and prayer as appropriate. 
The key trait to a tight pantheon is that its worshipers 
embrace a single ethos or dogma that includes all the 
deities. The gods of the tight pantheon work as one to 
protect and guide their followers. You can think of a 
tight pantheon as similar to a family. One or two deities 
who lead the pantheon serve as parent figures, with 
the rest serving as patrons of important aspects of the 
culture that worships the pantheon. A single temple 
honors all members of the pantheon. 
Most tight pantheons have one or more aberrant 
gods-deities whose worship isn't sanctioned by the 
priests of the pantheon as a whole. These are usually 
evil deities and enemies of the pantheon , such as the 
Greek Titans. These deities have cults of their own, 
attracting social outcasts and villains to their worship. 
These cults resemble mystery cults, their members strictly devoted to their single god, though even 
members of aberrant cults pay lip service in the temples 
of the tight pantheon. 
The Norse deities serve as an example of a tight 
pantheon. Odin is the pantheon's leader and father 
figure. Deities such as Thor, Tyr, and Freya embody 
important aspects of Norse culture. Meanwhile, Loki 
and his devotees lurk in the shadows, sometimes aiding 
the other deities, and sometimes working against them 
with the pantheon's enemies. 
MYSTERY CULTS 
A mystery cult is a secretive religious organization 
based on a ritual of initiation, in which the initiate is 
mystically identified with a god, or a handful of related 
gods. Mystery cults are intensely personal, concerned 
with the initiate's relationship with the divine. 
Sometimes a mystery cult is a type of worship within 
a pantheon. It acknowledges the myths and rituals of 
the pantheon , but presents its own myths and rites as 
primary. For instance, a secretive order of monks might 
immerse themselves in a mystical relationship to a god 
who is part of a broadly worshiped pantheon. 
A mystery cult emphasizes the history of its god, 
which is symbolically reenacted in its initiation ritual. 
The foundation myth of a mystery cult is usually simple 
and often involves a god's death and rising, or a journey 
to the underworld and a return. Mystery cults often 
revere sun and moon deities and agricultural deities­
gods whose portfolios reflect the cycles of nature. 
DIVINE RANK 
The divine beings of the multiverse are often categorized 
according to their cosmic power. Some gods are worshiped 
on multiple worlds and have a different rank on each world, 
depending on their influence there. 
Greater deities are beyond mortal understanding. They 
can't be summoned, and they are almost always removed 
from direct involvement in mortal affairs. On very rare 
occasions they manifest avatars similar to lesser deities, but 
slaying a greater god's avatar has no effect on the god itself. 
Lesser deities are embodied somewhere in the planes. 
Some lesser deities live in the Material Plane, as does the 
unicorn-goddess Lurue of the Forgotten Realms and the 
titanic shark-god Sekolah revered by the sahuagin . Others 
live on the Outer Planes, as Lolth does in the Abyss. Such 
deities can be encountered by mortals. 
Quasi-deities have a divine origin, but they don't hear or 
answer prayers, grant spells to clerics, or control aspects of 
mortal life. They are still immensely powerful beings, and in 
theory they could ascend to godhood if they amassed enough 
worshipers. Quasi-deities fall into three subcategories: 
demigods, titans, and vestiges. 
Demigods are born from the union of a deity and a mortal 
being. They have some divine attributes, but their mortal 
parentage makes them the weakest quasi-deities. 
Titans are the divine creations of deities. They might be 
birthed from the union of two deities, manufactured on 
a divine forge, born from the blood spilled by a god, or 
otherwise brought about through divine will or substance . 
Vestiges are deities who have lost nearly all their worshipers 
and are considered dead, from a mortal perspective. Esoteric 
rituals can sometimes contact these beings and draw on 
their latent power. 
"""' 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
TI 
12 The cult's ritual of initiation follows the pattern of its 
foundation myth. Neophytes retrace the god's footsteps 
in order to share the god's ultimate fate. In the case of 
dying and rising gods, the symbolic death of the initiate 
represents the idea of death to the old life and rebirth 
into a transformed existence. Initiates are born into 
a new life, remaining in the world of mortal affairs 
but feeling elevated to a higher sphere. The initiate is 
promised a place in the god's realm after death, but also 
experiences new meaning in life. 
MONOTHEISM 
Monotheistic religions revere only one deity, and in 
some cases, deny the existence of any other deity. If you 
introduce a monotheistic religion into your campaign , 
you need to decide whether other gods exist. Even if 
they don't, other religions can exist side by side with 
the monotheistic religion. If these religions have clerics 
with spellcasting ability, their spells might be powered 
by the one true deity, by lesser spirits who aren't deities 
(possibly including powerful aberrations , celestials , fey, 
fiends, or elementals) , or simply by their faith. 
The deity of a monotheistic religion has an extensive 
portfolio and is portrayed as the creator of everything, in 
control of everything , and concerned with every aspect 
of existence. Thus, a worshiper of this god offers prayers 
and sacrifices to the same god regardless of what 
aspect of life is in need of divine assistance. Whether 
marching into war, setting off on a journey, or hoping 
to win someone's affections, the worshiper prays to 
the same god. 
Some monotheistic religions describe different 
aspects of their deity. A single god appears in different 
aspects as the Creator and the Destroyer , and the clerics 
of that god focus on one aspect or the other, determining 
their domain access and possibly even their alignment 
on that basis. A cleric who venerates the Destroyer 
aspect chooses the Tempest or War domain, while 
one who worships a Creator aspect chooses the Life 
or Nature domains. In some monotheistic religions, 
clerics group themselves into distinct religious orders to 
differentiate clerics who choose different domains. 
DUALISM 
A dualistic religion views the world as the stage for 
a conflict between two diametrically opposed deities 
or divine forces. Most often, the opposed forces are 
good and evil, or opposed deities representing those 
forces. In some pantheons, the forces or deities of law 
and chaos are the fundamental opposites in a dualistic 
system. Life and death, light and darkness , rna ter and 
spirit, body and mind, health and illness, purity and 
defilement , positive energy and negative energy-the 
D&D universe is full of polar opposites that could serve 
as the foundation for a dualistic religion. Whatever the 
terms in which the dualism is expressed, half of the pair 
is usually believed to be good-beneficial , desirable, 
or holy-while the other half is considered bad, if not 
explicitly evil. If the fundamental conflict in a religion is 
expressed as the opposition between matter and spirit, 
the followers of that religion believe that one of the two 
(usually matter) is evil and the other (spirit) is good, and 
CHAPTER I j A WORLD Of YOUR OWN so seek to liberate their spirits from this material world 
and its evils through asceticism and contemplation. 
Rare dualistic systems believe that the two opposing 
forces must remain in balance, always pulling away 
from each other but remaining bound together in 
creative tension. 
In a cosmology defined by an eternal conflict between 
good and evil, mortals are expected to take sides. The 
majority of those who follow a dualistic religion worship 
the deity or force identified as good. Worshipers of 
the good deity trust themselves to that god's power to 
protect them from the evil deity's minions. Because 
the evil deity in such a religion is usually the source 
of everything that is detrimental to existence , only the 
perverse and depraved worship this god. Monsters 
and fiends serve it, as do certain secretive cults. The 
myths of a dualistic religion usually predict that the 
good deity will triumph in an apocalyptic battle, but the 
forces of evil believe that the outcome of that battle isn't 
predetermined and work to promote their deity's victory. 
Deities in a dualistic system maintain large portfolios. 
All aspects of existence reflect the dualistic struggle, 
and therefore all things can fall on one side or the other 
of the conflict. Agriculture , mercy, the sky, medicine , 
and poetry reside in the portfolio of the good deity, and 
famine, hatred, disease, and war belong to the evil deity. 
ANIMISM 
Animism is the belief that spirits inhabit every part of 
the natural world. In an animistic worldview , everything 
has a spirit, from the grandest mountain to the lowliest 
rock, from the great ocean to a babbling brook, from the 
sun and moon to a fighter's ancestral sword. All these 
objects, and the spirits that inhabit them, are sentient, 
though some are more aware, alert, and intelligent 
than others. The most powerful spirits might even 
be considered deities. All are worthy of respect if not 
veneration. 
Animists don't typically pay allegiance to one spirit 
over the others. Instead, they offer prayers and sacrifices 
to different spirits at different times, as appropriate 
to the situation. A pious character might make daily 
prayers and offerings to ancestor spirits and the spirits 
of the house, regular petitions to important spirits 
such as the Seven Fortunes of Good Luck, occasional 
sacrifices of incense to location spirits such as the 
spirit of a forest, and sporadic prayers to a host of other 
spirits as well. 
An animistic religion very tolerant. Most spirits don't 
care to whom a character also offers sacrifices, as long 
as they receive the sacrifices and respect they are due. 
As new religions spread through animist lands, those 
religions typically win adherents but not converts. 
People incorporate new spirits and deities into their 
prayers without displacing the old ones. Contemplatives 
and scholars adopt complex philosophical systems and 
practices without changing their belief in and respect 
for the spirits they already venerate. 
Animism functions as a large tight pantheon. Animist 
clerics serve the pantheon as a whole, and so can 
choose any domain, representing a favorite spirit for 
that cleric. 
FORCES AND PHILOSOPHIES 
Not all divine powers need to be derived from deities. 
In some campaigns , believers hold enough conviction 
in their ideas about the universe that they gain magical ·, · 
power from that conviction. In other campaigns , ' 
impersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods 
by granting power to mortals attuned to them. Just as 
druids and rangers can gain their spell ability from the 
force of nature rather than from a specific nature deity, 
some clerics devote themselves to ideals rather than to 
a god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and 
chivalry rather than a specific deity. 
Forces and philosophies aren't worshiped; they aren't 
beings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept 
sacrifices . Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn't 
necessarily exclusive of service to a deity. A person can 
be devoted to the philosophy of good and offer worship 
to various good deities, or revere the force of nature 
and also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might 
be seen as personal manifestations of an impersona l 
force. In a world that includes deities with demonstrable 
power (through their clerics), it's unusual for a 
philosophy to deny the existence of deities, although a 
common philosophica l belief states that the deities are 
more like mortals than they would have mortals believe. 
According to such philosophies, the gods aren't truly 
immortal (just very long-lived) , and mortals can attain 
divinity. In fact, ascending to godhood is the ultimate 
goal of some philosophies. . 
The power of a philosophy stems from the belief that 
mortals invest in it. A philosophy that only one person 
believes in isn't strong enough to bestow magical power 
on that person. 
HUMANOIDS AND THE GODS 
When it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider 
range of beliefs and institutions than other races do. In 
many D&D settings, orcs, elves, dwarves , goblins, and 
other humanoids have tight pantheons. It is expected 
that an ore will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of 
subordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces 
a staggering variety of deities. Each human culture 
might have its own array of gods. 
In most D&D settings, there is no single god that 
can claim to have created humanity . Thus, the human 
proclivity for building institutions extends to religion. 
A single charismatic prophet can convert an entire 
kingdom to the worship of a new god. With that 
prophet's death, the religion might wax or wane, or the 
prophet's followers might turn against one another and 
found several competing religions. 
In comparison, religion in dwarven society is set in 
stone. The dwarves of the Forgotten Realms identify 
Moradin as their creator. While individual dwarves 
might follow other gods, as a culture the dwarves are 
pledged to Moradin and the pantheon he leads. His 
teachings and magic are so thoroughly ingrained in 
dwarven culture that it would take a cataclysmic shift to 
replace him. 
With that in mind, consider the role of the gods in 
your world and their ties to different humanoid races. 
· Does each race have a creator god? How does that god • 
shape that race's culture? Are other folk free of such 
divine ties and free to worship as they wish? Has a race 
turned against the god that created it? Has a new race 
appeared , created by a god within the past few years? 
A deity might also have ties to a kingdom, noble 
line, or other cultural institution . With the death of 
the emperor, a new ruler might be selected by divine 
portents sent by the deity who protected the empire in 
its earliest days. In such a land, the worship of other 
gods might be outlawed or tightly controlled. 
Finally, consider the difference between gods who 
are tied to specific humanoid races and gods with 
more diverse followers. Do the races with their own 
pantheons enjoy a place of privilege in your world, with 
their gods taking an active role in their affairs? Are the 
other races ignored by the gods, or are those races the 
deciding factor that can tilt the balance of power in favor 
of one god or another? 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN !3 
I4 MAPPING YouR CAMPAIGN 
When creating the world where your campaign takes 
place, you'll want a map. You can take one of two 
approaches with it: top-down or bottom-up. Some DMs 
like to start at the top, creating the big picture of the 
world at the start of the campaign by having a map 
that shows whole continents, and then zooming in on 
smaller areas. Other DMs prefer to go the opposite 
direction , starting with a small campaign area that is 
mapped at a province or kingdom scale, then zooming 
out as adventures take the characters into new territory. 
Whichever approach you take, hexes work well for 
mapping outdoor environments where travel can go 
in any direction and calculating distance might be 
important. A single sheet of hex paper with 5 hexes to 
the inch is ideal for most maps. Use a scale for your map 
that's best suited to the level of detail you want. Chapter 
7 offers more information about creating and mapping 
wilderness areas. 
PROVINCE SCALE 
For the most detailed areas of your world, use a 
province scale where each hex represents 1 mile. A 
full-page map at this scale represents an area that 
can be covered in one day's travel in any direction 
from the center of the map, assuming clear terrain. As 
such, province scale is a useful scale for mapping a 
campaign's starting area (see "Creating a Campaign, " 
later in this chapter) or any location where you expect 
to track the adventurers ' movement in hours rather 
than days. • 
The ground cover of an area this size will include 
broad stretches of one predominant terrain type, broken 
up by other isolated terrain types. 
A settled region mapped at this scale might have one 
town and eight to twelve villages or farming hamlets. 
A wilder region might have only a single keep, or no 
settlements at all. You can also indicate the extent of 
the cleared farmland that surrounds each city or town. 
On a province-scale map, this will show as a belt a few 
hexes wide surrounding each town or village. Even 
small villages farm most of the arable land within a 
mile or two. 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN KINGDOM SCALE 
On a kingdom-scale map, each hex represents 6 miles. 
A map at this scale covers a large region, about the size 
of Great Britain or half the size of the state of California. 
That's plenty of room for adventuring. 
The first step of mapping a region at this scale is to 
sketch out the coastlines and any major bodies of water 
in the area. Is the region landlocked or on a coast? A 
coastal region might include islands offshore, and a 
landlocked area might include an inland sea or major 
lakes. Alternatively , the region could consist of a single 
large island, or an isthmus or peninsula with multiple 
coastlines. 
Next, sketch in any major mountain ranges. Foothills 
form a transition between the mountains and lowlands, 
and broad patches of gentle hills might dot the region. 
That leaves the rest of your map for relatively fiat 
terrain: grasslands , forests, swamps, and the like. Place 
these elements as you see fit. 
Map out the courses of any rivers that flow through 
the area. Rivers are born in mountains or inland areas 
that see a lot of rainfall, winding down to the nearest 
major body of water that doesn't require the river to 
cross over higher elevation. Tributaries join rivers as 
they grow larger and move toward a lake or the sea. 
Finally, place the major towns and cities of the region. 
At this scale, you don't need to worry about small towns 
and villages, or about mapping every belt of farmland. 
Even so, a settled region this size might easily have 
eight to twelve cities or towns to put on the map. 
CONTINENT SCALE 
For mapping a whole continent, use a scale where 
1 hex represents 60 miles. At this scale, you can't 
see more than the shape of coastlines, the biggest 
mountain ranges, major rivers, huge lakes, and political 
boundaries. A map at this scale is best for showing how 
multiple kingdom-scale maps fit together, rather than 
tracking the movement of adventurers day by day. 
The same process you use for mapping a region at 
kingdom scale works for mapping a whole continent. 
A continent might have eight to twelve large cities that 
deserve a place on the map, most likely major trade 
centers and the capitals of kingdoms. 
COMBINING SCALES 
--~--------------Whichever scale you start with, it's easy to zoom in or 
out on your maps. At continent scale, 1 hex represents 
the same area as 10 kingdom-scale hexes. Two cities 
that are 3 hexes (180 miles) apart on your continent 
map would be 30 hexes apart on your kingdom map, 
and might define the opposite ends of the region you're 
detailing. At kingdom scale, 1 hex equals 6 province­
scale hexes, so it's easy to put the region covered by your 
province-scale map into the center of a kingdom-scale 
map and create interesting areas around it. 
SETTLEMENTS 
The places where people live-bustling cities, 
prosperous towns, and tiny villages nestled among 
miles of farmland -help define the nature of civilization 
in your world. A single settlement -a home base for 
your adventurers -is a great place to start a campaign 
and begin your world building. Consider the following 
questions as you create any settlement in your world: 
What purpose does it serve in your game? 
How big is it? Who lives there? 
What does it look, smell, a-nd sound like? 
Who governs it? Who else holds power? Is it part 
of a larger state? 
What are its defenses? 
• Where do characters go to find the goods and services 
they need? 
• What temples and other organizations feature 
prominently? 
• What fantastic elements distinguish it from an 
ordinary town? 
Why should the characters care about the settlement? 
The guidelines in this section are here to help you build 
the settlement you want for whatever purpose you have 
in mind. Disregard any advice here that runs counter to 
your vision for a settlement. 
PURPOSE 
A settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story 
and fun of your campaign. Other than that point, the 
settlement's purpose determines the amount of detail 
you put into it. Create only the features of a settlement 
that you know you'll need, along with notes on general 
features. Then allow the place to grow organically as the 
adventurers interact with more and more of it, keeping 
notes on new places you invent. 
LOCAL COLOR 
A settlement might serve as a place where the 
characters stop to rest and to buy supplies. A settlement 
of this sort needs no more than a brief description. 
Include the settlement's name, decide how big it is, 
add a dash of flavor ("The smell of the local tanneries 
never lifts from this town"), and let the adventurers get 
on with their business. The history of the inn where 
the characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the 
shopkeeper they buy supplies from-you can add this 
level of detail, but you don't have to. If the characters 
return to the same settlement, start adding these local 
features so that it begins to feel a little more like a home 
base, albeit a temporary one. Let the settlement develop 
as the need arises. 
HOME BASE 
A settlement gives the adventurers a place to live, 
train, and recuperate between adventures. An entire 
campaign can center on a particular town or city. 
Such a settlement is the launching pad from which the 
characters go out into the wider world. 
Designed well, a home base can hold a special place 
in the adventurers ' hearts, particularly if they care about 
one or more NPCs who live there. 
To make a home base come alive, you'll need to 
invest some time fleshing out details, but the players 
can help you with that work. Ask them to tell you a bit 
about mentors, family members , and other important 
people in their characters' lives. Feel free to add to and 
modify what they give you, but you'll start with a solid 
foundation of the non player characters (NPCs) who are 
important to the characters. Let the players describe 
where and how their characters spend their time-a 
favorite tavern, library, or temple, perhaps. 
Using these NPCs and locations as a starting point, 
flesh out the settlement's cast of characters . Detail 
its leadership , including law enforcement (discussed 
later in the chapter). Include characters who can 
provide information , such as sages, soothsayers, 
librarians , and observant vagabonds. Priests can 
provide spellcasting as well as information. Make note 
of merchants who might regularly interact with the 
adventurers and perhaps compete with one another for 
the party's business. Think about the people who run 
the adventurers ' favorite tavern. And then add a handful 
of wild cards: a shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired 
mercenary , a drunken rake, or anyone else who adds a 
dash of adventure and intrigue to your campaign. 
ADVENTURE SITE 
A village harboring a secret cult of devil worshipers. A 
town controlled by a guild of wererats. A city conquered 
by a hobgoblin army. These settlements aren't merely 
rest stops but locations where adventures unfold. In 
a settlement that doubles as an adventure location, 
detail the intended adventure areas, such as towers 
and warehouses. For an event-based adventure, note 
the NPCs who play a part in the adventure. This 
work is adventure preparation as much as it is world 
building, and the cast of characters you develop for 
your adventure-including allies, patrons, enemies, and 
extras-can become recurring figures in your campaign. 
SIZE 
Most settlements in a D&D world are villages clustered 
around a larger town or city. Farming villages supply the 
town or city population with food in exchange for goods 
the farmers can't produce themselves . Towns and cities 
are the seats of the nobles who govern the surrounding 
area, and who carry the responsibility for defending the 
villages from attack. Occasionally, a local lord or lady 
lives in a keep or fortress with no nearby town or city. 
VILLAGE 
Population: Up to about 1,000 
Government: A noble (usually not a resident) rules the 
village, with an appointed agent (a reeve) in residence 
to adjudicate disputes and collect taxes. 
Defense: The reeve might have a small force of soldiers. 
Otherwise , the village relies on a citizen militia. 
Commerce: Basic supplies are readily available, 
possibly from an· inn or a trading post. Other goods 
are available from traveling merchants . 
Organizations: A village might contain one or two 
temples or shrines, but few or no other organizations. 
_ lost settlements are agricultur al villages, supporting 
themselves and nearby towns or cities with crops and 
meat. Villagers produce food in one way or another-if 
not by tending the crops, then supporting those who do 
by shoeing horses, weaving clothes, milling grain, and 
the like. The goods they produce feed their families and 
upply trade with nearby settlements . 
A village's population is dispersed around a large area 
of land. Farmers live on their land, which spreads them 
videly around the village center. At the heart of the 
\·illage, a handful of structures cluster together: a well, 
a marketplace , a small temple or two, a gathering place, 
and perhaps an inn for travelers . 
TowN 
Population: Up to about 6,000 
Government: A resident noble rules and appoints a lord 
mayor to oversee administration. An elected town 
council represents the interests of the middle class. 
Defense: The noble commands a sizable army of 
professional soldiers, as well as personal bodyguards. 
Commerce: Basic supplies are readily available, though 
exotic goods and services are harde·r to find. Inns and 
taverns support travelers. 
Organizations: The town contains several temples, 
as well as various merchant guilds and other 
organizations. 
Towns are major trade centers, situated where important 
industries and reliable trade routes enabled the 
population to grow. These settlements rely on commerce: 
!.he import of raw materials and food from surrounding 
·illages, and the export of crafted items to those villages, 
as well as to other towns and cities. A town's population 
i more diverse than that of most villages. 
Towns arise where roads intersect waterways, at the 
meeting of major land trade routes, around strategic 
defensive locations, or near significant mines or similar 
natural resources. 
CITY 
Population: Up to about 25,000 
Government: A resident noble presides, with several 
other nobles sharing responsibility for surrounding 
areas and government functions. One such noble is 
the lord mayor, who oversees the city administration. 
An elected city council represents the middle class 
and might hold more actual power than the lord 
mayor. Other groups serve as important power 
centers as well. 
Defense: The city supports an army of professional 
soldiers, guards, and town watch. Each noble in 
residence maintains a small force of personal 
bodyguards. 
Commerce: Almost any goods or services are readily 
available. Many inns and taverns support travelers . 
Organizations: A multitude of temples, guilds, and 
other organizations, some of which hold significant 
power in city affairs, can be found within the 
city's walls. 
Cities are cradles of civilization. Their larger 
populations require considerable support from both 
urrounding villages and trade routes, so they're rare. Cities typically thrive in areas where large expanses 
of fertile, arable land surround a location accessible to 
trade, almost always on a navigable waterway. 
Cities almost always have walls, and the stages of a 
city's growth are easily identified by the expansion of 
the walls beyond the central core. These internal walls 
naturally divide the city into wards (neighborhoods 
defined by specific features), which have their own 
representatives on the city council and their own noble 
administrators. 
Cities that hold more than twenty-five thousand people 
are extremely rare. Metropolises such as Waterdeep in 
the Forgotten Realms, Sharn in Eberron, and the Free 
City of Greyhawk stand as vital beacons of civilization in 
the D&D worlds. 
ATMOSPHERE -------
What do the adventurers first notice as they approach 
or enter a settlement? The towering wall bristling 
with soldiers? The beggars with hands outstretched, 
pleading for aid outside the gate? The noisy hubbub of 
merchants and buyers thronging the market square? 
The overpowering stench of manure? 
Sensory details help bring a settlement to life and 
vividly communicate its personality to your players. 
Settle on a single defining factor that sums up a 
settlement 's personality and extrapolate from there. 
Maybe a city is built around canals, like real-world 
Venice. That key element suggests a wealth of sensory 
details: the sight of colorful boats floating on muddy 
waters, the sound of lapping waves and perhaps singing 
gondoliers, the smells of fish and waste polluting 
the water, the feel of humidity. Or perhaps the city is 
shrouded in fog much of the time, and you describe the 
tendrils of cold mist reaching through every crack and 
cranny, the muffled sounds of hooves on cobblestones, 
the cold air with the smell of rain, and a sense of 
mystery and lurking danger. 
The climate and terrain of a settlement's environment, 
its origin and inhabitants , its government and political 
position, and its commercial importance all have a 
bearing on its overall atmosphere. A city nestled against 
the edge of a jungle has a very different feel than one 
on the edge of a desert. Elf and dwarf cities present 
a distinct aesthetic, clearly identifiable in contrast to 
human-built ones. Soldiers patrol the streets to quell 
any hint of dissent in a city ruled by a tyrant, while a city 
fostering an early system of democracy might boast an 
open-air market where philosophical ideas are traded as 
freely as produce. All the possible combinations of these 
factors can inspire endless variety in the settlements of 
your campaign world. 
GOVERNMENT 
In the feudal society common in most D&D worlds, 
power and authority are concentrated in towns and 
cities. Nobles hold authority over the settlements 
where they live and the surrounding lands. They collect 
taxes from the populace, which they use for public 
building projects, to pay the soldiery, and to support a 
comfortable lifestyle for themselves (although nobles 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
18 often have considerable hereditary wealth). In exchange, 
they promise to protect their citizens from threats 
such as ore marauders, hobgoblin armies, and roving 
human bandits. 
Nobles appoint officers as their agents in villages, to 
supervise the collection of taxes and serve as judges 
in disputes and criminal trials. These reeves, sheriffs, 
or bailiffs are commoners native to the villages they 
govern, chosen for their positions because they already 
hold the respect of their fellow citizens. 
Within towns and cities, lords share authority and 
administrative responsibility with lesser nobles (usually 
their own relatives), and also with representatives of 
the middle class, such as traders and artisans. A lord 
mayor of noble birth is appointed to head the town or 
city council and to perform the same administrative 
functions that reeves carry out in villages. The council 
consists of representatives elected by the middle class. 
Only foolish nobles ignore the wishes of their councils, 
since the economic power of the middle class is often 
more important to the prosperity of a town or city than 
the hereditary authority of the nobility. 
The larger a settlement , the more likely that other 
individuals or organizations hold significant power 
there as well. Even in a village, a popular individual-a 
wise elder or a well-liked farmer-can wield more 
influence than the appointed reeve, and a wise reeve 
avoids making an enemy of such a person. In towns 
and cities, the same power might lie in the hands of a 
prominent temple, a guild independent of the council, or 
an individual with magical power. 
FORMS OF GOVERNMENT 
A settlement rarely stands alone. A given town or city 
might be a theocratic city-state or a prosperous free city 
governed by a merchant council. More likely, it's part of 
a feudal kingdom, a bureaucratic empire, or a remote 
realm ruled by an iron-fisted tyrant. Consider how your 
settlement fits into the bigger picture of your world or 
region-who rules its ruler, and what other settlements 
might also lie under its control.

Typical and fantastical forms of government are 
described below. Choose one or randomly determine a 
form of government for a nation or city from the Forms 
of Government table. 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN Autocracy. One hereditary ruler wields absolute 
power. The autocrat either is supported by a well­
developed bureaucracy or military or stands as the 
only authority in an otherwise anarchic society. The 
dynastic ruler could be immortal or undead. Aundair 
and Karrnath, two kingdoms in the Eberron campaign 
setting, have autocrats with royal blood in their veins. 
Whereas Queen Aurala of Aundair relies on wizar.ds 
and spies to enforce her will, Kaius, the vampire king of 
Karrnath , has a formidable army of living and undead 
soldiers under his command. 
Bureaucracy. Various departments compose the 
government, each responsible for an aspect of rule. The 
department heads, ministers , or secretaries answer to a 
figurehead autocrat or council. 
Confederacy. Each individual city or town within 
the confederacy governs itself, but all contribute to a 
league or federation that promotes (at least in theory) 
the common good of all member states. Conditions and 
attitudes toward the central government vary from place 
to place within the confederacy. The Lords' Alliance in 
the Forgotten Realms setting is a loose confederacy of 
cities, while the Mror Holds in the Eberron campaign 
setting is a confederacy of allied dwarf clans. 
Democracy. Citizens or their elected representatives 
determine the laws in a democracy. A bureaucracy or 
military carries out the day-to-day work of government, 
with positions filled through open elections. 
Dictatorship. One supreme ruler holds absolute 
authority, but his or her rule isn't necessarily dynastic. 
In other respects this resembles an autocracy. In the 
Greyhawk campaign setting, a half-demon named Iuz is 
the dictator of a conquered land that bears his name. 
Feudalism. The typical government of Europe in 
the Middle Ages, a feudalistic society consists of layers 
of lords and vassals. The vassals provide soldiers or 
scutage (payment in lieu of military service) to the lords, 
who in turn promise protection to their vassals. 
Gerontocracy. Elders preside over this society. In 
some cases, long-lived races such as elves or dragons 
are entrusted with the leadership of the land. 
Hierarchy. A feudal or bureaucratic government 
where every member, except one, is subordinate to 
another member. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, 
the dragonarmies of Krynn form a military hierarchy , 
with the Dragon Highlords as leaders under the dragon 
queen Takhisis. 
Kleptocracy. This government is composed of groups 
or individuals primarily seeking wealth for themselves, 
often at the expense of their subjects. The grasping 
Bandit Kingdoms in the Grey hawk campaign setting 
are prime examples. A kingdom run by thieves' guilds 
would also fall into this category. 
Magocracy. The governing body is composed of 
spellcasters who rule directly as oligarchs or feudal 
lords, or participate in a democracy or bureaucracy. 
Examples include the Red Wizards of Thay in the 
Forgotten Realms campaign setting and the sorcerer­
kings of Athas in the Dark Sun campaign setting. 
Matriarchy or Patriarchy. This society is governed 
by the eldest or most important members of one gender. 
Draw cities are examples of theocratic matriarchies, for 
each is ruled by a council of drow high priestesses who 
answer to Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders. 
Meritocracy. The most intelligent and educated 
people oversee the society, often with a bureaucracy 
to handle the day-to-day work of government. In the 
Forgotten Realms, scholarly monks preside over the 
fortress-library of Candlekeep, overseen by a master of 
lore called the Keeper. 
Militocracy. Military leaders run the nation under 
martial law, using the army and other armed forces. A 
militocracy might be based on an elite group of soldiers, 
an order of dragon riders, or a league of sea princes. 
olamnia, a nation ruled by knights in the Dragonlance 
campaign setting, falls into this category. 
Monarchy. A single hereditary sovereign wears the 
crown. Unlike the autocrat, the monarch 's powers are 
limited by law, and the ruler serves as the head of a 
democracy, feudal state, or militocracy . The kingdom 
of Breland, in the Eberron campaign setting, has both 
a parliament that makes laws and a monarch who 
enforces them. 
Oligarchy. A small number of absolute rulers share 
power, possibly dividing the land into districts or 
provinces under their control, or jointly ruling together. 
_.\group of adventurers who take control of a nation 
together might form an oligarchy. The Free City of 
Greyhawk is an oligarchy composed of various faction 
leaders, with a Lord Mayor as its figurehead. 
Plutocracy. Society is governed by the wealthy. The 
elite form a ruling council, purchase representati"on at 
rhe court of a figurehead monarch , or rule by default 
because money is the true power in the realm. Many 
cities in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, 
including Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, are plutocracies. 
Republic. Government is entrusted to representatives 
of an established electorate who rule on behalf of the 
electors. Any democracy in which only landown ers or 
certain classes can vote could be considered a republic. 
Satrapy. Conquerors and representatives of another 
government wield power, ruling the settlement or region 
as part of a larger empire. The satraps are bureaucrats 
and military officers, or unusual characters or monsters. 
The cities of High port and Suder ham in the Greyhawk 
campaign setting are satrapies controlled by agents of a 
,·icious gang of marauders known as the Slave Lords. 
Theocracy. Rulership falls to a direct representative 
or a collection of agents of a deity. The centers of power 
in a theocracy are usually located on sacred sites. In 
the Eberron campaign setting, the nation of Thrane is 
a theocracy devoted to the Silver Flame, a divine spirit 
that resides in Thrane's capital of Flamekeep.

Countess COMMERCE 
Even small villages can provide characters access to the 
gear they need to pursue their adventures . Provisions, 
tents, backpacks, and simple weapons are commonly 
available. Traveling merchants carry armor, martial 
weapons, and more specialized gear. Most villages have 
inns that cater to travelers , where adventurers can find 
a hot meal and a bed, even if the quality leaves much to 
be desired. 
Villages rely heavily on trade with other settlements, 
including larger towns and cities. Merchants pass 
through regularly, selling necessities and luxuries to the 
vil,Iagers , and any successful merchant has far-reaching 
contacts across the region. Traveling merchants pass 
on gossip and adventure hooks to the characters as 
they conduct their business. Since merchants make 
their living traversing roads that might be menaced 
by bandits or wandering monsters , they hire guards to 
keep their goods safe. They also carry news from town 
to town, including reports of situations that cry out for 
the attention of adventurers. 
These merchants can't provide the services normally 
found in a city. For instance, when the characters are in 
need of a library or a dedicated sage, a trainer who can 
handle the griffon eggs they've found, or an architect to 
design their castle, they're better off going to a large city 
than looking in a village. 
CURRENCY 
The straightforward terms "gold piece" (gp), "silver 
piece" (sp), "copper piece" (cp), "electrum piece" (ep), 
and "platinum piece" (pp) are used throughout the game 
rules for clarity. You can imbue these denominations 
with more interesting descriptions in your game 
world. People give coins specific names, whether 
as plain as "dime" or lively as "gold double-eagle." A 
country typically mints its own currency, which might 
correspond to the basic rules terms. In most worlds, few 
currencies achieve widespread distribution , but nearly 
all coins are accepted worldwide -except by those 
looking to pick a fight with a foreigner. 
ExAMPLE : THE FoRGOTTEN REALMS 
The world of the Forgotten Realms provides an 
extensive example of currencies. Although barter, 
blood notes, and similar letters of trade are common 
enough in Faerfin, metal coins and trade bars are the 
everyday currency. 
Common Coinage. Coins appear in a bewildering 
variety of shapes, sizes, names, and materials . Thanks 
to the ambitious traders of Sembia, that nation's oddly 
shaped coins can be found throughout Faerfin. In 
Sembia, square iron steelpence replace copper coins. 
Triangular silver pieces are ravens, diamond-shaped 
electrum pieces are harmarks (commonly called "blue 
eyes"), and five-sided gold pieces are nobles. Sembia 
doesn't mint platinum coins. All coinage is accepted 
in Sembia, including copper and platinum pieces 
from abroad. 
In Waterdeep, the bustling cosmopolitan center 
of trade, coppers are called nibs, silvers are shards, 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 19 
20 electrum pieces are moons, gold pieces are dragons, 
and platinum coins are suns. The city's two local coins 
are the toal and the harbor moon. The toal is a square 
brass trading-coin pierced with a central hole to permit 
it to be easily strung on a ring or string, worth 2 gp in 
the city and nothing outside Waterdeep. The harbor 
moon is a flat crescent of platinum with a central 
hole and an electrum inlay, named for its traditional 
use in the docks for buying large amounts of cargo at 
once. The coin is worth 50 gp in Waterdeep and 30 gp 
elsewhere. 
The northern city of Silverymoon mints a crescent­
shaped, shining blue coin called an electrum moon, 
worth 1 gp in that city and 1 ep elsewhere. The city also 
issues a larger coin called an eclipsed moon, which 
looks like an electrum moon combined a darker silver 
wedge to form a round coin worth 5 ep within the city 
and 2 ep outside it. 
The favored form of currency in the kingdom of 
Cormyr is the royal coinage of the court, stamped with 
a dragon on one side and a treasury date mark on the 
other. There, coppers are called thumbs, silvers are 
silver falcons, electrum pieces are blue eyes, gold pieces 
are golden lions, and platinum coins are tricrowns. 
Even city-states mint their own copper, silver, and gold 
pieces. Electrum and platinum pieces are rarer in these 
lands. Smaller states use coinage borrowed from other 
nations and looted from ancient sources. Travelers from 
certain lands (notably the wizard-dominated realms of 
Thay and Halruaa) use the currencies of other realms 
when trading abroad because their own coins and 
tokens are feared to be magically cursed, and so are 
shunned by others. 
Conversely, the coins of long-lost, legendary lands 
and centers of great magic are honored, though those 
who find them are wise to sell them to collectors rather 
than merely spending them in markets. The coins of the 
old elven court of Cormanthyr are particularly famous: 
thalvers (coppers), bedoars (silvers), thammarchs 
(electrum), shilmaers (golds), and ruendils (platinum). 
These coins are fine, numerous, and sometimes still 
used in trade among elves.

CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN Trade Bars. Large numbers of coins can be difficult 
to transport and account for. Many merchants prefer 
to use trade bars-ingots of precious metals and alloys 
(usually silver) likely to be accepted by virtually anyone. 
Trade bars are stamped or graven with the symbol of the 
trading company or government that originally crafted 
them. These bars are valued by weight, as follows: 
• A 2-pound silver bar is worth 10 gp and is about 5 
inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1/2 inch thick. 
A 5-pound silver bar is worth 25 gp and is about 6 
inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. 
A 5-pound gold bar is worth 250 gp and is about the 
size of a 2-pound silver bar. 
The city of Baldur's Gate mints large numbers of 
silver trade bars and sets the standard for this form of 
currency. The city of Mirabar issues black iron spindle­
shaped trade bars with squared ends weighing about 
2 pounds each, worth 10 gp in that city, markedly less 
in nearby trade centers, and as iron is normally valued 
elsewhere (1 sp per pound). 
Odd Currency. Coins and bars aren't the only forms 
of hard currency. Gond bells are small brass bells worth 
10 gp in trade, or 20 gp to a temple of Gond. Shaar 
rings, pierced and polished slices of ivory threaded 
onto strings by the nomads of the Shaar, are worth 3 gp 
per slice. 
CREATING YouR OwN 
As shown in the previous examples, currency doesn't 
need to obey a universal standard in your world. Each 
country and era can have its own coins with its own 
values. Your adventurers might travel through many 
different lands and find long-lost treasures. Finding 
· six hundred ancient bed oars from the rule of Coronal 
Eltargrim twelve centuries before offers a deeper sense 
of immersion in your world than finding 60 sp. 
Varying names and descriptions of coins for the 
major contemporary and historical realms of your world 
adds an additional layer of texture. The golden lions of 
Cormyr convey the noble nature of that kingdom. If a 
nation mints gold coins stamped with leering demonic 
faces and called torments , that currency expresses a 
distinct flavor. 
Creating new coins connected to specific locations, 
like the toals ofWaterdeep or the eclipsed moons of 
Silverymoon, provides another level of detail. As long as 
you keep the value of these new coins simple (in other 
words, don't invent a coin worth 1.62 gp), you add local 
flavor to key locations in your world without adding 
undue complexity. 
LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS 
When fleshing out your world, you can create new 
languages and dialects to reflect its unique geography 
and history. You can replace the default languages 
presented in the Player's Handbook with new ones, or 
split languages up into several different dialects. 
In some worlds, regional differences might be much 
more important than racial ones. Perhaps all the 
dwarves, elves, and humans who live in one kingdom 
speak a common language , which is completely different 
11ARPER5 ORDER OF THE GAUNTLET EMERALD ENCLAVE LoRDs' ..ALLIANCE ZHENTARIM 
from that spoken in the neighboring kingdom. This 
might make communication (and diplomacy) between 
rwo kingdoms significantly more difficult. 
Widely used languages might have ancient versions, 
or there might be completely different ancient tongues 
that adventurers find written in tombs and ruins. Such 
languages can add an element of mystery to inscriptions 
and tomes that characters encounter. 
You might invent additional secret languages , besides 
Druidic and thieves' cant, that allow members of certain 
organizations or political affiliations to communicate. 
You could even decide that each alignment has its 
own language, which might be more of an argot used 
primarily to discuss philosophical concepts. 
In a region where one race has subjugated another, 
the language of the conquerors can become a mark of 
ocial status. Similarly, reading and writing might be 
restricted by law to the upper classes of a society. 
FACTIONS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS 
Temples, guilds, orders, secret societies , and 
colleges are important for.ces in the social order of 
any civilization. Their influence might stretch across 
multiple towns and cities, with or without a similarly 
wide-ranging political authority . Organizations can 
play an important part in the Jives of player characters, 
becoming their patrons, allies, or enemies just like 
individual non player characters. When characters join 
these organizations, they become part of something 
larger than themselves, which can give their adventures 
a context in the wider world. 
ADVENTURERS AND ORGANIZATIONS 
At the start of a campaign , backgrounds are a great 
way to connect adventurers to your world. As the game 
progresses, though, background ties often become less 
important. 
Factions and organizations aimed at player characters 
are a way to keep higher-level adventurers connected 
m your world, providing ties to key NPCs and a clear 
agenda beyond individual gain. In the same way, 
Yillainous organizations create an ongoing sense of 
menace above and beyond the threat of solitary foes. 
Having different characters tied to different factions 
can create interesting situations at the gaming table, as 
long as those factions have similar goals and don't work 
in opposition to one another all the time. Adventurers representing different factions might have competing 
interests or priorities while they pursue the same goals. 
Adventurer organizations are also a great source of 
special rewards beyond experience points and treasure. 
Increased standing in an organization has value in and 
of itself, and might also come with concrete benefits 
such as access to an organization 's information, 
equipment, magic, and other resources. 
CREATING FACTIONS 
Factions and organizations that you create for your 
campaign should grow out of the stories that are 
important to the world. Create organizations that your 
players will want to interact with, whether as allies, 
members, or enemies. 
As a starting point, decide what role you want an 
organization to play in the world. What is it all about? 
What are its goals? Who founded it and why? What do 
its members do? Answering these questions should 
SAMPLE FACTION: THE HARPERS 
The Harpers is a scattered network of spellcasters and spies 
who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of 
power, magical or otherwise. 
The organization has risen, been shattered, and risen 
again several times. Its longevity and resilience are largely 
due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the 
autonomy of its various members. The Harpers have small 
cells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms, 
although they interact and share information with one 
another from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers' 
ideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their 
ingenuity and incorruptibility. Harpers don't seek power or 
glory, only fair and equal treatment for all. 
Motto. "Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all." 
Beliefs. The Harpers' beliefs can be summarized as follows: 
One can never have too much information or arcane 
knowledge . 
• Too much power leads to corruption, and the abuse of 
magic in particular must be closely monitored. 
No one should be powerless . 
Goals. Gather information throughout FaerCln, discern 
the political dynamics within each region, and promote 
fairness and equality by covert means. Act openly as a last 
resort. Thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group 
that grows too powerful. Aid the weak, the poor, and the 
oppressed . 
Typical Quests. Typical Harper quests include securing 
an artifact that would upset the balance of power in a 
region, gathering information on a powerful individual or 
organization , and determining the true intentions of an 
ambitious political figur~ or evil spellcaster. 
CHAPTER l I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 21 
give you a good sense of the organization's personality. 
From there, think about typical members. How might 
people describe them? What are the typical members' 
classes and alignments? What personality traits do they 
tend to share? 
Choosing a symbol and a motto for the organization 
is a way of summing up the work you've done so far. 
A faction that uses a stag as a symbol probably has a 
very different personality from one that uses a winged 
viper. For a motto, choose not just a message but also 
a tone and style of speech that fits the organization as 
you've defined it. Consider the motto of the Harpers: 
"Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all." The 
Harpers have a straightforward message of freedom 
and prosperity. Contrast that with the motto of a 
group of politically allied cities in the North calling 
themselves the Lords' Alliance: "Threats to home must 
be terminated without prejudice. Superiority is our 
security." These are sophisticated people involved in 
a delicate political alliance, with more emphasis on 
stability than on fairness and equality. 
Finally, think about the ways that player characters 
might come into contact with the organization. Who 
are the important members-not just the leaders, 
but the agents in the field that the adventurers might 
encounter? Where are they active, and where do they 
have headquarters or strongholds? If adventurers do 
join, what kind of missions might they be sent on? What 
rewards can they gain? 
RENOWN 
Renown is an optional rule you can use to track an 
adventurer's standing within a particular faction or 
organization. Renown is a numerical value that starts 
at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and 
reputation within a particular organization. You can tie 
benefits to a character's renown, including ranks and 
titles within the organization and access to resources. 
A player tracks renown separately for each 
organization his or her character is a member of. For 
example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within 
one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the 
character's interaction with each organization over the 
course of the campaign. 
GAINING RENOWN 
A character earns renown by completing missions or 
quests that serve an organization's interests or involve 
the organization directly. You award renown at your 
discretion as characters complete these missions 
or quests, typically at the same time you award 
experience points.

CHAPTER l I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN Advancing an organization's interests increases 
a character 's renown within that organization by 1. 
Completing a mission specifically assigned by that 
organization , or which directly benefits the organization, 
increases the character's renown by 2 instead. 
For example, characters with connections to the noble 
Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which 
they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. 
Because the order likes to punish evildoers , you might 
increase each character 's renown within the order 
by 1. Converse ly, if killing the dragon was a mission 
given to the adventurers by a senior member of the 
order, completing the task might instead increase each 
character 's renown by 2, showing the adventurers as 
effective allies. 
Meanwhile, the party's rogue might have looted a box 
of rare poisons from the dragon's hoard and sold it to 
a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might 
increase the rogue's renown within the Zhentarim by 2 
since this action directly increased that group's power 
and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an 
agent of the Zhentarim. 
BENEFITS OF RENOWN 
The benefits of increasing renown within an 
organization can include rank and authority , friendly 
attitudes from members of the organization, and 
other perks. 
Rank. Characters can earn promotions as their 
renown increases. You can establish certain thresholds 
of renown that serve as prerequisites (though not 
necessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in 
rank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table. 
For example, a character might join the Lords' Alliance 
after earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining 
the title of cloak. As the character's renown within the 
organization increases, he or she might be eligible for 
further increases in rank. 
You can add rank prerequisites. For example, a 
character affiliated with the Lords' Alliance might have 
to be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at 
least lOth level to be a warduke, and at least 15th level 
to be a lioncrown. 
You can set these thresholds of renown to any 
numbers that work for your game, creating appropriate 
ranks and titles for the organizations in your campaign. 
Attitudes of Organization Members. As a character's 
renown within an organization grows, members of 
that organization are increasingly likely to have heard 
of the character. You can set thresholds at which the 
default attitude of an organization's members toward 
the character becomes indifferent or friendly. For 
example, members of the Emerald Enclave-a faction 
Emerald Enclave Lord's Alliance Zhentarim 
Springwarden Cloak Fang 
Summerstrider Redknife Wolf 
Autumnreaver Stingblade Viper 
Winterstalker Warduke Ardragon 
Master of the Wild Lion crown Dread Lord 
dedicated to preserving the natural order-might be 
less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated 
at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming 
-riendly by default only when a character has gained 10 
renown within the Emerald Enclave. These thresholds 
apply only to the default attitude of most members of an 
organization, and such attitudes aren't automatic. NPC 
faction members might dislike an adventurer despite 
that character's renown-or perhaps because of it. 
Perks. Earning a rank within an organization comes 
with certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of 
low rank might gain access to a reliable contact and 
adventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to 
offer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked 
character might gain a follower (see chapter 4, "Creating 
_ -onplayer Characters"), access to potions and scrolls, 
the ability to call in a favor, or backup on dangerous 
missions. A high-ranking character might be able to 
call on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item, 
gain access to a helpful spellcaster , or assign special 
missions to members of lower rank. 
Downtime Activities. You might allow characters 
to spend downtime between adventures building 
;elationships and gaining renown within an 
organization. For more information on downtime 
activities, see chapter 6, "Between Adventures." 
LOSING RENOWN 
Disagreements with members of an organization 
aren't enough to cause a loss of renown within that 
organization. However, serious offenses committed 
against the organization or its members can result 
in a loss of renown and rank within the organization. 
The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is 
left to your discretion. A character's renown within an 
organization can never drop below 0. 
PIETY 
\Vith a few alterations , the renown system can also 
erve as a measure of a character's link to the gods. It's 
a great option for campaigns where the gods take active 
roles in the world. 
Using this approach, you track renown based on 
pecific divine figures in your campaign. Each character 
bas the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with 
goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any 
renown he or she earns is called piety. A character 
gains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their 
commands, . and respecting their taboos. A character 
loses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring 
them, defiling their temples, and foiling their aims. 
The gods bestow favors on those who prove their 
devotion. With each rank of piety gained, a character 
can pray for divine favor once per day. This favor usually 
comes in the form of a cleric spell like bless. The favor 
often comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for 
example, a character dedicated to Thor might receive a 
pel! accompanied by the boom of thunder. 
A high level of piety can also lead to a character 
gaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a 
blessing or charm (see chapter 7, "Treasure, " for such 
upernatural gifts). MAGIC IN YouR WoRLD 
In most D&D worlds, magic is natural but still wondrous 
and sometimes frightening. People everywhere know 
about magic, and most people see evidence of it at some 
point in their lives. It permeates the cosmos and moves 
through the ancient possessions of legendary heroes, 
the mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched 
by the gods, creatures born with supernatural power, 
and individuals who study the secrets of the multiverse. 
Histories and fireside tales are filled with the exploits of 
those who wield it. 
What normal folk know of magic depends on where 
th.ey live and whether they know characters who 
practice magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet might not 
have seen true magic used for generations and speak 
in whispers of the strange powers of the old hermit 
living in the nearby woods. In the city of Waterdeep 
in the Forgotten Realms setting, the Watchful Order 
of Magists and Protectors is a guild of wizards. These 
arcanists wish to make wizardry more accessible so the 
order's members can profit from selling their services. 
Some D&D settings have more magic in them than 
others. On Athas, the harsh world of the Dark Sun 
setting, arcane magic is a hated practice that can drain 
life from the world. Much of Athas's magic lies in the 
hands of evildoers. Conversely, in the world of Eberron, 
magic is as commonplace as any other commodity. 
Mercantile houses sell magic items and services to 
SAMPLE FACTION: THE ZHENTARIM 
The Zhentarim (also known as the Black Network) is an 
unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its 
influence and power throughout the Forgotten Realms. 
The public face of the Black Network appears relatively 
benign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and services, 
both legal and illicit, thus destroying its competitors and 
making everyone dependent on it. 
A member of the Zhentarim thinks of himself or herself 
as a member of a very large family and relies on the Black 
Network for resources and security. However, members are 
granted the autonomy to pursue their own interests and gain 
some measure of personal wealth and influence. As a whole, 
the Zhentarim promises "the best of the best," although 
in truth the organization is more interested in spreading 
its own propaganda and influence than investing in the 
improvement of its individual members. 
Motto. "join us and prosper. Oppose us and suffer." 
Beliefs. The Zhentarim's beliefs can be summarized 
as follows: 
• The Zhentarim is your family. You watch out for it, and it 
watches out for you. 
• You are the master of your own destiny. Never be less than 
what you deserve to be. 
Everything and everyone has a price. 
Goals. Amass wealth, power, and influence, and thereby 
dominate Faerun. 
Typical Quests. Typical Zhentarim quests include 
plundering or stealing a treasure hoard, powerful magic item, 
or artifact; securing a lucrative business contract or enforcing 
a preexisting one; and establishing a foothold in a place 
where the Zhentarim holds little sway. 
CHAPTER I I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 23 
anyone who can afford them. People purchase tickets to 
ride airships and trains propelled by elemental magic. 
Consider these questions -when fitting magic into 
your world: 
Is some magic common? Is some socially 
unacceptable? Which magic is rare? 
How unusual are members of each spellcasting 
class? How common are those who can cast high­
level spells? 
How rare are magic items, magical locations, 
and creatures that have supernatural powers? At 
what power level do these things go from everyday 
to exotic? 
How do authorities regulate and use magic? How 
do normal folks use magic and protect them­
selves from it? 
The answers to some questions suggest the answers 
to others. For example, if spell casters of low-level 
spells are common, as in Eberron, then authorities and 
common folk are more likely to have access to and use 
the results of such spells. Buying commonplace magic 
isn't only possible, but also less expensive. People are 
more likely to keep well-known magic in mind, and to 
protect against it, especially in risky situations. 
RESTRICTIONS ON MAGIC 
Some civilized areas might restrict or prohibit the use 
of magic. Spellcasting might be forbidden without a 
license or official permission. In such a place, magic 
items and continual magical effects are rare, with 
protections against magic being the exception. 
Some localities might prohibit specific spells. It could 
be a crime to cast any spells used to steal or swindle, 
such as those that bestow invisibility or produce 
illusions. Enchantments that charm or dominate others 
are readily outlawed, since they rob their subjects of 
free will. Destructive spells are likewise prohibited, for 
obvious reasons. A local ruler could have a phobia about 
a specific effect or spell (such as shapeshifting effects if 
he or she were afraid of being impersonated) and enact 
a law restricting that type of magic. 
SCHOOLS OF MAGIC 
The rules of the game refer to the schools of magic 
(abjuration, illusion, necromancy, and so on), but it's 
up to you to determine what those schools signify in 
your world. Similarly, a few class options suggest the 
existence of magic-using organizations in the world­
bardic colleges and druid circles-which are up to you to 
flesh out. · 
You could decide that no formal structures like these 
exist in your world. Wizards (and bards and druids) 
might be so rare that a player character learns from a 
single mentor and never meets another character of the 
same class, in which case wizards would learn their 
school specialization without any formal training. 
However, if magic is more common, academies can 
be the embodiments of the schools of magic. These 
institutions have their own hierarchies, traditions, 
regulations, and procedures. For example, Materros 
the necromancer could be a brother of the necromantic 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN Cabal of Thar-Zad. As a sign of his high standing within 
its hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green 
robes of a master. Of course, when he wears these 
robes, his occupation is easily identified by those who 
know of the cabal. This recognition could be a boon or 
a nuisance , since the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a fearsome 
reputation. 
If you go this route, you can treat schools of magic, 
bardic colleges, and druid circles as organizations, 
using the guidelines for organizations presented earlier 
in this chapter. A player character necromancer might 
cultivate renown within the Cabal of Thar-Zad, while 
a bard seeks increasing renown within the College of 
Mac-Fuirmidh. 
TELEPORTATION CIRCLES 
The presence of permanent teleportation circles in 
major cities helps cement their important place in the 
economy of a fantasy world. Spells such as plane shift, 
teleport, and teleportation circle connect with these 
circles, which are found in temples, academies, the 
headquarters of arcane organizations, and prominent 
civic locations. However, since every teleportation circle 
is a possible means of entry into a city, they're guarded 
by military and magical protection. 
As you design a fantasy city, think about the 
teleportation circles it might contain and which ones 
adventurers are likely to know about. If the adventurers 
commonly return to their home base by means of 
a teleportation circle, use that circle as a hook for 
plot developments in your campaign. What do the 
adventurers do if they arrive in a teleportation circle and 
find all the familiar wards disabled and guards lying 
in pools of blood? What if their arrival interrupts an 
.argument between two feuding priests at the temple? 
Adventure ensues! 
BRINGING BACK THE DEAD 
When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves 
the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, 
and goes to abide on the plane where the creature's 
deity resides. If the creature didn't worship a deity, its 
soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. 
Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving 
the soul from that plane and returning it to its body. 
Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for 
a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping 
the body prevents others from using raise dead or 
resurrection to restore the slain character to life. 
A soul can't be returned to life if it doesn't wish to 
be. A soul knows the name, alignment , and patron 
deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and 
might refuse to return on that basis. For example, if 
the honorable knight Sturm Brightblade is slain and a 
high priestess of Takhisis (god of evil dragons) grabs 
his body, Sturm might not wish to be raised from the 
dead by her. Any attempts she makes to revive him 
automatically fail. If the evil cleric wants to revive Sturm 
to interrogate him, she needs to find some way to trick 
his soul, such as duping a good cleric into raising him 
and then capturing him once he is alive again. 
CREATING A CAMPAIGN 
The world you create is the stage for the 
adventures you set in it. You don't have to give more 
thought to it than that. You can run adventur es in 
an episodic format, with the characters as the only 
common element, and also weave themes throughout 
those adventures to build a greater saga of the 
characters' achievements in the world. 
Planning an entire campaign might seem like a 
daunting task, but you don't have to plot out every 
detail right from the start. You can start with the 
basics, running a few adventures , and think about 
larger plotlines you want to explore as the campaign 
progresses. You're free to add as much or as little detail 
a you wish. 
The start of a campaign resembles the start of an 
adventure. You want to jump quickly into the action, 
how the players that adventure awaits, and grab 
their attention right away. Give the players enough 
information to make them want to come back week after 
·eek to see how the story plays out. 
START SMALL 
\"hen you first start building your campaign, start 
-mall. The characters need to know only about the 
city, town, or village where they start the game, and 
perhaps the nearby dungeon. You might decide that 
the barony is at war with a nearby duchy, or that a 
distant forest is crawling with ettercaps and giant 
piders, and you should note these things. But at 
the start of the game, the local area is enough to get 
the campaign off the ground. Follow these steps to 
create that local area: 
1. CREATE A HOME BASE 
ee the "Settlements" section earlier in this chapter 
;"or guidance on building this settlement. A small 
·own or village at the edge of the wilderness serves 
a fine home base in most D&D campaigns. Use 
a larger town or city if you want a campaign with 
rban adventuring. 
2. CREATE A LOCAL REGION 
-ee "Mapping the Campaign" earlier in this chapter 
:or guidance. Draw a map at province scale (1 hex= 
l mile) with the home base near the center. Fill 
n the area within a day's travel-about 25 to 30 
:niles-of the home base. Pepper it with two to 
:our dungeons or similar adventure locales . 
. -ill area that size is likely to have one to three 
additional settlements as well as the home base, 
so give thought to them as well. 
3. CRAFT A STARTING ADVENTURE 
ingle dungeon makes a good first adventur e 
'or most campaigns. See chapter 3, "Creating 
_ dventures," for guidance. 
A home base provides a common starting 
.ocation for the characters. This starting point 
might be the village where they grew up or a 
ci _-that attracted them from points beyond. 
Or perhaps they begin the campaign in the dungeons 
of an evil baron's castle where they've been locked up 
for various reasons (legitimate or otherwise), throwing 
them into the midst of the adventure. 
For each of these steps, give the locations only as 
much detail as they need. You don't need to identify 
every building in a village or label every street in a large 
city. If the characters start in the baron's dungeon , you'll 
need the details of this first adventure site, but you 
don't have to name all the baron's knights. Sketch out 
a simple map, think about the surrounding area, and 
consider whom the characters are most likely to interact 
with early in the campaign. Most important, visualize 
how this area fits into the theme and story you have in 
mind for your campaign. Then start working on your 
first adventure! 
SET THE STAGE 
As you start to develop your campaign , you'll need to 
fill in the players on the basics. For easy distribution, 
compile essential information into a campaign 
handout. Such a handout typically includes the 
following material: 
Any restrictions or new options for character creation, 
such as new or prohibited races. 
Any information in the backs tory of your campaign 
that the characters would know about. If you have 
a theme or direction in mind for the campaign, this 
information could include seeds hinting at that focus. 
• Basic information about the area where the characters 
are starting, such as the name of the town, important 
locations in and around it, prominent NPCs they'd 
know about, and perhaps rumors that point to trouble 
that's brewing. 
Keep this handout short and to the point. Two pages 
is a reasonable maximum. Even if you have a burst of 
creative energy that produces twenty pages of great 
background material, save it for your adventures. Let 
the players uncover the details gradually in play. 
INVOLVING THE CHARACTERS 
Once you've identified what your campaign is about, 
let the players help tell the story by deciding how their 
characters are involved. This is their opportunity to 
tie their characters' history and background to the 
campaign, and a chance for you to determine how the 
various elements of each character 's background tie 
into the campaign's story. For example, what secret has 
the hermit character learned? What is the status of the 
noble character 's family? What is the folk hero's destiny? 
Some players might have trouble coming up with 
ideas-not everyone is equally inventive. You can help 
spur their creativity with a few questions about their 
characters: 
Are you a native, born and raised in the area? If so, 
who's your family? What's your current occupation? 
• Are you a recent arrival? Where did you come from? 
Why did you come to this area? 
CHAPTER I I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN Are you tied to any of the organizations or people 
involved in the events that kick off the campaign? Are 
they friends or enemies? 
Listen to the players' ideas, and say yes if you can. 
Even if you want all the characters to have grown up in 
the starting town, consider allowing a recent arrival or 
a transplant if the player's story is convincing enough. 
Suggest alterations to a character's story so it better fits 
your world, or weave the first threads of your campaign 
into that story. 
CREATING A BACKGROUND 
Backgrounds are designed to root player characters 
in the world, and creating new backgrounds is a great 
way to introduce players to the special features of your 
world. Backgrounds that have ties to particular cultures, 
organizations, and historical events from your campaign 
are particularly strong. Perhaps the priests of a certain 
religion live as beggars supported by a pious populace, 
singing the tales of their deity's exploits to entertain 
and enlighten the faithful. You could create a mendicant 
priest background (or modify the acolyte background) 
to reflect these qualities. It could include musical 
instrument proficiency , and its feature probably involves 
receiving hospitality from the faithful. 
Guidelines for creating a new background are 
provided in chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop." 
CAMPAIGN EVENTS 
Significant events in the history of a fantasy world tend 
toward immense upheavals: wars that pit the forces 
of good against evil in an epic confrontation, natural 
disasters that lay waste to entire civilizations , invasions 
of vast armies or extra planar hordes, assassinations 
of world leaders. These world-shaking events title the 
chapters of history. 
In a D&D game, such events provide the sparks that 
can ignite and sustain a campaign. The most common 
pitfall of serial stories without a set beginning , mfddle, 
and end is inertia. Like many television shows and 
comic-book series, a D&D campaign runs the risk of 
retreading the same ground long after the enjoyment's 
gone. Just as actors or writers drift away from those 
other mediums , so can players-the actors and writers 
of a D&D game. Games stagnate when the story 
meanders too long without a change in tone, when the 
same villains and similar adventures grow tiresome and 
predictable, and when the world doesn't change around 
the characters and in response to their actions. 
World-shaking events force conflict. They set new 
events and power groups in motion. Their outcomes 
change the world by altering the tone of the setting 
in a meaningful way. They chronicle the story of your 
world in big, bold print. Change-especially change that 
occurs as a result of the characters' actions-keeps the 
story moving. If change is imperceptible , the actions 
of the characters lack significance. When the world 
becomes reliable, it's time to shake things up. 
PuTTING EvENTS IN MoTION --------
World-shaking events can happen at any time in 
a campaign or story arc, but the biggest incidents 
naturally fall at the beginning , middle, and end 
of a story. 
That placement reflects the structure of dramatic 
stories. At the beginning of a story, something happens 
to shake the protagonists' world and spur them into 
action. The characters take action to resolve their 
problems , but other forces oppose them. As they reach a 
significant milestone toward their goal, a major conflict 
disrupts the characters ' plans, shaking their world 
again; failure seems imminent. At the end of the story, 
they succeed or fail, and the world is shaken again by 
the way the characters changed it for good or ill. 
At the beginning of a D&D campaign , world-shaking 
events create instant adventure hooks and affect the 
characters' lives directly. In the middle, they make great 
turning points as the characters' fortunes reverse­
rising after a defeat or falling after a victory. Near 
the end of a campaign, such events serve as excellent 
climactic episodes with far-reaching effects. They might 
even occur after the story has ended, as a result of the 
characters ' actions. 
WHEN NoT To SHAKE IT UP -----
In constructing a narrative , beware of "false action," 
or action for its own sake. False action doesn't move 
a story forward, engage characters, or cause them to 
change. Many action movies suffer from false action, in 
which car chases, gunfights , and explosions abound but 
do little more than inconveni ence the characters and 
eventually bore the audience with their repetition and 
dearth of meaningful stakes. Some D&D campaigns fall 
into the same trap, stringing world-spanning disasters 
together one after another with little impact on the 
characters or the world. Thus, it's probably not in the 
DM's best interest to reorder the world every single time 
there's a lull in the action, lest world-shaking events 
become ordinary. 
As a general rule, a campaign can sustain up to 
three large-scale, world-shaking events: one near the 
beginning, one near the middle, and one near the 
end. Use as many small-scale events that disturb the 
bounded microcosms of towns, villages, tribes, fiefs, 
duchies, provinces, and so forth as you like. Every 
significant event shakes someone 's ·world, after all, no 
matter how small that world might be. Let unexpected 
and terrible events regularly afflict the world's smaller 
territories, but unless your story demands it, save the 
large-scale map-spanning events for the biggest, most 
important moments of your campaign.

Eras are often defined by the prominent leaders, 
innovators, and tyrants of the day. These people change 
the world and etch their signatures indelibly on the 
pages of history. When they rise to power, they shape 
the time and place where they live in monumen tal ways. 
When they fall from power or pass away, the ghost of 
their presence lingers.

or passing era. You can choose the type of leader or

Political leaders are monarchs , nobles, and chiefs. 
Religious leaders include deities' avatars, high priests, 
and messiahs , as well as those in charge of monasteries 
and leaders of influential religious sects. Major military 
leaders control the armed forces of countries. They 
include military dictators , warlords, and the heads of 
a ruler's war council. Minor military leaders include 
the heads of local militias, gangs, and other martial 
organizations. At the broadest scale, a criminal or 
underworld leader wields power through a network of 
spies, bribes, and black-mark et trade. On the smallest 
scale, these are local gang bosses, pirate captains, and 
brigands. A leader in art or culture is a virtuoso whose 
work reflects the spirit of the age and changes the way 
people think: a prominent playwright , bard, or court fool 
in whose words, art, or performan ce the people perceive 
universal truth. On a smaller scale, this might be an 
influential local poet, minstrel, satirist, or sculptor. 
A major leader in philosophy , learning, or magic is 
a genius philosopher , a counselor to emperors, an 
enlightened thinker, the head of the highest institution 
of learning in the world, or an archmage. A minor leader 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 
?..7 
might be a local sage, seer, hedge wizard, wise elder, 
or teacher. 
Rise of a Leader, Beginning of an Era. In dramatic 
stories, a new leader's rise often comes at the end of 
a period of struggle or turmoil. Sometimes it's a war 
or uprising; other times it's an election, the death of a 
tyrant, a prophecy fulfilled, or the appointment of a hero. 
Converse ly, the new leader might be a tyrant, a fiend, or 
black-hearted villain, and the era that just ended could 
have been one of peace, tranquility, and justice. 
A new leader shakes the foundations of your campaign 
world and begins a new era in the selected region. How 
does this person or this era begin to affect the world? 
Here are several things to consider when determining 
the leader's impact on the world: 
• Name one thing that has been consistently true about 
the world, which is now no longer true due to this 
leader's rise or influence. This is the biggest change 
that occurs when the new leader takes power and 
becomes the prevailing trait that defines the era, the 
characteristic for which it is remembered. 
• Name the person (or people) whose death, defeat, or 
loss opened the door for this leader to take power. 
This might be a military defeat, the overthrow of 
old ideas, a cultural rebirth, or something else. Who 
died, lost, or was defeated? What weren't they willing 
to compromise? Was the new leader complicit in 
the death, defeat, or loss, or was the opportunity 
serendipitous? 
• Despite the leader's virtues, one flaw in particular 
outrages a certain segment of the populace. What 
is that flaw? What person or group of persons will 
do their utmost to foil this leader because of it? 
Conversely, what is this leader's greatest virtue, and 
who rises to the leader's defense because of it? 
• Who believes in this leader now, but still retains 
doubts? This is someone close to the leader, who has 
the leader's trust and knows his or her secret fears, 
doubts, or vices. 
FaJJ of a Leader, End of an Era. All that begins must 
end. With the fall of kings and queens, the maps of the 
world are redrawn. Laws change, new customs become 
all the rage, and old ones fall out of favor. The attitude 
of the citizens toward their fallen leader shifts subtly at 
first and then changes dramatically as they look back or 
reminisce about the time before. 
The fallen leader might have been a benevolent 
ruler, an influential citizen, or even an adversary to the 
characters. How does the death of this person affect 
those formerly under his or her influence? ijere are 
several things to consider when determining the effects 
of a leader's passing: 
• Name one positive change that the leader brought to 
his or her domain or sphere of influence. Does that 
change persist after the leader's death? 
State the general mood or attitude of the people under 
this person's power. What important fact didn't they 
realize about this person or his or her reign, which 
will later come to light? 
Name one person or group that tries to fill the leader's 
shoes in the resulting power vacuum. 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN Name one person or group that plotted against 
this leader. 
Name three things for which this leader will be 
remembered. 
3. CATACLYSMIC DISASTER 
Earthquak e, famine, fire, plague, flood-disasters on a 
grand scale can eradicate whole civilizations without 
warning. Natural (or magical) catastrophes redraw 
maps, destroy economies , and alter worlds. Sometimes 
the survivors rebuild from the ruins. The Great Chicago 
Fire, for instance, provided an opportunit y to rebuild 
the city according to a modern plan. Most of the time 
the disaster leaves only ruins-buried under ash like 
Pompeii, or sunk beneath the waves like Atlantis. 
You can choose the cataclysm or determine one 
randomly using the Cataclysmic Disasters table. 
CATACLYSMIC DISASTERS

5 Plaguefdisease 
6 Rain of fire (meteoric impact) 
7 Storm (hurricane , tornado, tsunami) 
8 Volcanic eruption 
9 Magic gone awry or a planar warp 
10 Divine judgment 
Some of the disasters on the table might not make 
immediate sense in the context of your campaign 
world. A flood in the desert? A volcanic eruption on 
grassy plains? If you randomly determine a disaster 
that conflicts with your setting, you can reroll, but the 
challenge of justifying the catastrophe can produce 
interesting results. 
With two exceptions, the disasters on the table 
resemble those that affect our own world. Think 
of planar warps and magic gone awry like nuclear 
incidents; they're big events that unnaturally alter 
the land and its people. For example, in the Eberron 
campaign setting, a magical catastrop he lays waste 
to an entire country, transforming it into a hostile 
wasteland and ending the Last War. 
Divine judgment is something else entirely. This 
disaster takes whatever form you want, but it's always a 
big, bold, unsubtle sign of a deity's displeasure. 
You might decide to wipe a town, region, or nation off 
the map of your world. A disaster ravages the land and 
effectively eliminates a place the characters once knew. 
Leave one or two survivors to tell the characters what 
happened, and ensure that the characters feel the depth 
of the catastrophe. What are the ongoing effects of this 
cataclysm? The following points can help you define the 
nature and consequences of the disaster: 
• Decide what caused this cataclysm and where it 
originated. 
• An omen presaged this event, or a series of signs and 
omens. Describe the omen in detail. 
• Describe or name the creature that warned the 
populace about the oncoming disaster. Who listened? 
ho were the lucky (or unlucky) ones who survived? 
• Describe what the area looks like after the disaster, in 
contrast to how it looked before. 
~.ASSAULT OR INVASION 
ne of the most common world-shaking events, an 
Yasion occurs when one group forcibly takes over 
.another, usually by military strength, but also by 
.nfiltration and occupation. 
An assault differs from an invasion in that the 
acking force isn't necessarily interested in occupation 
r taking power. On the other hand, an assault might be 
e first step of an invasion. 
Regardless of the scale, a world-shaking assault or 
vasion stands out because its repercussions change 
e characters ' world, and its effects echo long after the 
.nitial attack or takeover. 
Imagine that part of your campaign world is attacked 
r invaded. Depending on the current scale of your 
ampaign, the area might be as small as a section 
of a city or as large as a continent , world, or plane of 
existence. 
Define the aggressor and whether it represents a 
..mown enemy or a previously unknown adversary. 
-elect a threat that already poses a danger to the area 
_·ou've chosen, or use the Invading Forces table to 
determine the aggressor. 
INVADING FoRCEs 
d8 Invading Force 
A criminal enterprise 
2 Monsters or a unique monster 
3 A planar threat 
4 A past adversary reawakened, reborn, or resurgent 
5 A splinter faction 
6 A savage tribe 
7 A secret society 
8 A traitorous ally Now consider these other aspects of the conflict: 
Name one element of the invasion or assault that the· 
defenders didn't expect or couldn't repel. 
Something happened to the first defenders who stood 
against the invasion or assault-something no one 
wants to talk about. What was it? 
• The attackers or invaders had a motive for their 
action that wasn't obvious or understood at first. 
What was it? 
• Who turned traitor, and at what point did they turn? 
Why did they do it? Did an attacker try to stop the 
incursion, or did a prominent defender throw in with 
the invaders? 
5. REBELLION, REVOLUTION, OVERTHROW 
Dissatisfied with the current order, a person or group 
of people overturns the dominant regime and takes 
over-or fails to take over. Regardless of the result, a 
revolution (even an attempted one) can shape the destiny 
of nations. 
The scale of a revolution need not involve the common 
masses against the nobility. A revolution can be as small 
as a merchants ' guild revolting against its leadership 
or a temple overthrowing its priesthood in favor of a 
new creed. The spirits of the forest might attempt to 
overthrow the forces of civilization in a nearby city that 
cut down trees for timber. Alternatively, the scale can be 
as dramatic as humanity rising to overthrow the gods. 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 29 
Imagine that part of your campaign world erupts in 
revolution . Pick a power group in your current campaign 
and name (or invent) a group that opposes it, fomenting 
revolution. Then let the following points help you flesh 
out the conflict: 
Name three things the rebels want or hope to achieve. 
• The rebels achieve a victory against those they wish 
to overthrow, even if it's a pyrrhic victory. Which of 
their three goals do they achieve? How long is this 
achievement likely to last? 
State the cost exacted upon the old order after its 
fall from power. Does anyone from the former power 
group remain in power during the next regime? If the 
old order remains in power, describe one way that its 
leaders punish the revolutionaries. 
• One of the rebellion's prominent leaders-in some 
respects the face of the revolution -was driven by a 
personal reason for his or her part in events. Describe 
this person and state the true reason he or she led the 
rebellion. 
• What problem existed before the revolution that 
persists in spite of it? 
6. EXTINCTION OR DEPLETION 
Something that once existed in the campaign world 
is gone. The lost resource might be a precious metal, 
a species of plant or animal that held an important 
place in the local ecology, or an entire race or culture of 
people. Its absence causes a chain reaction that affects 
every creature that uses or relies on it. 
You can eliminate a people, place, or thing that 
previously existed in a certain location or area in your 
campaign world. On a small scale, the last of a family 
. dynasty passes away or a once-thriving mining town 
in the region dries up and becomes a ghost town. On a 
grand scale, magic dies, the last dragon is slain, or the 
final fey noble departs the world. 
What is gone from the world-or the region of the 
world you've chosen-that once existed there? If the 
answer isn't immediately evident, consult the Extinction 
or Depletion table for ideas. 
EXTINCTION OR DEPLETION 
d8 Lost Resource 
A kind of animal (insect, bird, fish, livestock) 
2 Habitable land 
3 Magic or magic-users (all magic, or specific kinds or 
schools of magic) 
4 A mineral resource (gems, metals, ores) 
5 A type of monster (unicorn, manticore , dragon) 
6 A people (family line, clan, culture, race) 
7 A kind of plant (crop, tree, herb, forest) 
8 A waterway (river, lake, ocean) 
Then consider these additional questions: 
Name a territory, race, or type of creature that relied 
on the thing that was lost. How do they compensate? 
How do they attempt to substitute for what was lost? 
Who or what is to blame for the loss? 
Describe an immediate consequence of the loss. 
Forecast one way that the loss impacts or changes 
the world in the long term. Who or what suffers the 
most as a result of the loss? Who or what benefits the 
most from it? 
7. NEW ORGANIZATION 
The foundation of a new order, kingdom, religion, 
society, cabal, or cult can shake the world with its 
actions, doctrine, dogma, and policies. On a local 
scale, a new organization contends with existing power 
groups, influencing, subverting, dominating , or allying 
with them to create a stronger base of power. Large 
and powerful organizations can exert enough influence 
to rule the world. Some new organizations benefit the 
populace, while others grow to threaten the civilization 
they once protected. 
Perhaps an important new organization arises in one 
part of your world. It could have humble or auspicious 
beginnings, but one thing is certain: it is destined to 
change the world as long as it progresses along its 
present course. Sometimes an organization's alignment 
is apparent from inception, but its morality can remain 
ambiguous until its doctrines , policies, and traditions 
are revealed over time. Choose the type of organization, 
or use the New Organizations table to generate ideas. 
NEW ORGANIZATIONS

6 Philosophy/discipline dedicated to a principle or ideal 
7 Realm (village, town, duchy, kingdom) 
8 Religionjsectjdenomination 
9 Schoolfuniversity 
10 Secret societyfcultfcabal 
Then consider some or all of the following options: 
The new order supplants a current power group in 
the world, gaining territory, converts, or defectors and 
reducing the previous power group's numbers. Who or 
what does the foundation of this new order supplant? 
The new order appeals to a specific audience. Decide 
whether this order attracts a certain race, social class, 
or character class. 
The leader of this new order is known for a particular 
quality valued by his or her followers. Elaborate on 
why they respect him or her for this quality, and 
what actions this leader has taken to retain the 
followers' support. 
A rival group opposes the foundation of this new 
organization . Choose an existing power group from 
your campaign to oppose the new organization, or 
create one from the categories on the table. Decide 
why they oppose the new group, who leads them, and 
what they plan to do to stop their rival. 8. DISCOVERY, EXPANSION , INVENTION 
Discoveries of new lands expand the map and change 
the boundaries of empires. Discoveries of new magic 
or technology expand the boundaries of what was once 
thought possible. New resources or archaeological finds 
create opportunity and wealth and set prospectors and 
power groups in motion to vie for their control. 
A new discovery-or rediscovery-can impact your 
campaign world in a meaningful way, shaping the 
course of history and the events of the age. Think of this 
discovery as a big adventure hook or series of hooks. 
This is also an opportunity to create a unique monster, 
item, god, plane, or race for your world. As long as the 
discovery matters, it doesn't have to be wholly original, 
just flavored for your campaign. 
A discovery is particularly impressive when the 
adventurers in your campaign are the ones who 
make it. If they discover a new mineral with magical 
properties, map a new land that's eminent ly suitable 
for colonization , or uncover an ancient weapon with 
the power to wreak devastation on your world, they 
are likely to set major events in motion. This gives 
the players the opportunity to see exactly how much 
influence their actions have on your world. 
Decide on the type of discovery that is made or use 
the Discoveries table to generate ideas. 
DISCOVERIES 
dl 0 Discovery

2 Animalfmonsterfmagical mutation 
3 lnventionftechnologyjmagic (helpful, destructive) 
4 New (or forgotten) god or planar entity

6 New land (island, continent, lost world, demiplane) 
7 Otherworldly object (planar portal, alien spacecraft) 
8 People (race, tribe, lost civilization , colony) 
9 Plant (miracle herb, fungal parasite, sentient plant) 
10 Resource or wealth (gold, gems, mithral) 
Once you have determined the type of discovery, flesh 
it out by deciding exactly what it is, who discovered 
it, and what potential effect it could have on the 
world. Ideally, previous adventures in your campaign 
will help you fill in the blanks, but also keep the 
following in mind: 
This discovery benefits a particular person, group, or 
faction more than others. Who benefits most? Name 
three benefits they stand to gain from this discovery. 
This discovery directly harms another person, group, 
or faction. Who is harmed the most? 
• This discovery has consequences. Name three 
repercussions or side effects. Who ignores the 
repercussions? 
Name two or three individuals or factions struggling 
to possess or control this discovery. Who is likely to 
win? What do they stand to gain, and what are they 
willing to do to control the discovery? 
CHAPTER l I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 3l 
9. PREDICTION' OMEN' PROPHECY 
Sometimes the foretelling of a world-shaking event 
becomes a world-shaking event: an omen that predicts 
the fall of empires, the doom of races, and the end 
of the world. Sometimes an omen points to change 
for the good, such as the arrival of a legendary hero 
or savior. But the most dramatic prophecies warn of 
future tragedies and predict dark ages. Unlike other 
world-shaking events, the outcome doesn't happen 
immediately. Instead, individuals or factions strive to 
fulfill or avert the prophecy-or shape the exact way it 
will be fulfilled-according to how it will affect them. 
The prophecy 's helpers or hinderers create adventure 
hooks in the campaign by the actions they take. A 
prophecy should foretell a big event on a grand scale, 
since it will take time to come true (or be averted). 
Imagine that a world-shaking prophecy comes to light. 
If events continue on their present course, the prophecy 
will come true and the world will change dramatically 
as a result. Don't shy away from making this prophecy 
both significant and alarming, keeping in mind the 
following points: 
Create a prophecy that foretells a major change to 
the campaign world. You can build one from scratch 
using ideas from the current campaign or randomly 
determine a world-shaking event and fl~sh out 
the details. 
Write a list of three or more omens that will occur 
before the prophecy comes to pass. You can use 
events that have already occurred in the campaign so 
that the prophecy is closer to being fulfilled. The rest 
are events that might or might not happen, depending 
on the actions of the characters. 
Describe the person or creature that discovered 
the prophecy and how it was found. What did this 
creature gain by revealing it? What did this person 
lose or sacrifice? 
• Describe the individual or faction that supports the 
prophecy and works to ensure its fulfillment, and the 
one that will do all in its power to avert the prophecy . 
What is the first step each takes? Who suffers for 
their efforts? 
One part of the prophecy is wrong. Choose one of the 
omens you listed or one of the details you created for 
the world-shaking event that the omen predicts. The 
chosen omen is false, and if applicable , its opposite is 
true instead. 
10. MYTH AND LEGEND 
If wars, plagues, discoveries, and the like can be called 
regular world-shaking events, mythic events exceed 
and surpass them. A mythic event might occur as the 
fulfillment of an ancient or long-forgotten prophecy , or it 
might be an act of divine intervention. 
Once again, your current campaign probably provides 
a few ideas for the shape of this event. If you need 
inspiration, roll a d8 on the World-Shaking Events table, 
instead of the normal dlO. Address the bullet-point 
notes for that disaster, but magnify the result to the 
grandest scale you can imagine. 
CHAPTER 1 j A WORLD OF YOUR OWN The rise or fall of a leader or era is the death or 
birth of a god, or the end of an age or the world. A 
cataclysmic disaster is a world-drowning deluge, an ice 
age, or a zombie apocalypse . An assault or invasion is 
a world war, a world-spanning demonic incursion, the 
awakening of a world-threatening monster, or the final 
clash between good and evil. A rebellion dethrones a 
god or gods, or raises a new force (such as a demon 
lord) to divinity. A new organization is a world-spanning 
empire or a pantheon of new gods. A discovery is a 
doomsday device or a portal to eldritch dimensions 
where world-shattering cosmic horrors dwell. 
TRACKING TIME 
A calendar lets you record the passage of time in the 
campaign. More importantly, it lets you plan ahead for 
the critical events that shake up the world. For simple 
time tracking, use a calendar for the current year in 
the real world. Pick a date to indicate the start of the 
campaign , and make note of the days that adventurers 
spend on their travels and various activities . The 
calendar tells you when the seasons change and 
the lunar cycle. More importantly , you can use your 
calendar to track important festivals and holidays, as 
well as key events that shape your campaign. 
This method is a good starting point, but the calendar 
of your world need not follow a modern calendar. If you 
want to customize your calendar with details unique to 
your world, consider these types of features. 
THE BASICS 
A fantasy world's calendar doesn't have to mirror the 
modern one, but it can (see "The Calendar of Harptos" 
sidebar for an example). Do the weeks of a month have 
names? What about specific days of each month, like the 
ides, nones, and calends of the Roman calendar? 
PHYSICAL CYCLES 
Determine when the seasons fall, marked by the 
solstices and equinoxes. Do the months correspond 
to the phases of the moon (or moons)? Do strange 
and magical effects occur at the same time as these 
phenomena? 
RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES 
Sprinkle holy days throughout your calendar. Each 
significant deity in your world should have at least one 
holy day during the year, and some gods' holy days 
correspond to celestial phenomena such as new moons 
or equinoxes. Holy days reflect the portfolio of a deity (a 
god of agriculture is honored in the harvest season) or 
significant events in the history of the deity's worship, 
such as the birth or death of a holy person, the date of 
a god's manifestation, the accession of the current high 
priest, and so on. 
Certain holy days are civic events, observed by every 
citizen of a town where a god's temple can be found. 
Harvest festivals are often celebrations on a grand 
scale. Other holy days are important only to people 
particularly devoted to a single deity. Still others are 
observed by priests, who perform private rites and 
sacrifices inside their temples on certain days or specific 
times of day. And some holy days are local, observed by 
dle faithful of a specific temple. 
Give some thought to how priests and common folk 
-elebrate holy days. Going into a temple, sitting in a 
pew, and listening to a sermon is a mode of worship 
"oreign to most fantasy religions. More common ly, 
celebrants offer sacrifices to their gods. The faithful 
bring animals to the temple to be slaughtered or 
urn incense as an offering. The wealthiest citizens 
oring the largest animals, to flaunt their wealth and 
emonstrate their piety. People pour out libations at the 
graves of their ancestors. They spend all-night vigils in 
darkened shrines or enjoy splendid feasts celebrating a 
god's bounty. 
CIVIC OBSERVANCES 
Holy days provide the majority of the special 
celebrations in most calendars, but local or national 
:estivals account for many others. The birthday of a 
:nonarch, the anniversary of a great victory in a war, 
craft festivals, market days, and similar events all 
;>rovide excuses for local celebrations. 
fANTASTIC EVENTS 
-ince your setting is a fantasy world and not a mundane 
::nedieval society, add in a few events of an obviously 
magical nature. For example, perhaps a ghostly castle 
appears on a certain hill on the winter solstice every 
_·ear, or every third full moon fills lycanthropes with a 
particularly strong bloodlust. Also, the thirteenth night 
of every month could mark the ghostly wanderings of a 
ong-forgotten nomadic tribe. 
Extraordinary events, such as the approach of a comet 
or a lunar eclipse, make good adventure elements, and 
:ou can drop them in your calendar wherever you want. 
Your calendar can tell you when there's a full moon for 
a lunar eclipse, but you can always fudge the date for a 
articular effect. 
ENDING A CAMPAIGN 
A campaign's ending should tie up all the threads of 
beginning and middle, but you don't have to take a 
campaign all the way to 20th level for it to be satisfying. 
.\'rap up the campaign whenever your story reaches its 
atural conclusion . 
:Make sure you allow space and time near the end 
of your campaign for the characters to finish up any 
personal goals. Their own stories need to end in 
a atisfying way, just as the campaign story does. 
deally, some of the characters' individual goals will be 
:ulfilled by the ultimate goal of the final adventure. Give 
haracters with unfinished goals a chance to finish them 
before the very end. 
Once the campaign has ended, a new one can begin. 
f you intend to run a new campaign for the same group 
of players, using their previous characters' actions as 
r.he basis of legends gives them immediate investment in 
dle new setting. Let the new characters experience how 
me world has changed because of their old characters. 
n the end, though, the new campaign is a new story 
·ith new protagonists. They shouldn't have to share the 
-potlight with the heroes of days gone by. The world of the Forgotten Realms uses the Calendar of 
Harptos, named after the long-dead wizard who invented 
it. Each year of 365 days is divided into twelve months of 
thirty days each, which roughly correspond to months in the 
real-world Gregorian calendar. Each month is divided into 
three tendays. Five special holidays fall between the months 
and mark the seasons. Another special holiday, Shieldmeet, 
is inserted into the calendar after Midwinter every four years, 
much like leap years in the modern Gregorian calendar.

CHAPTER l I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 33 
34 PLAY STYLE 
By building a new world (or adopting an existing one) 
and creating the key events that launch your campaign, 
you determined what your campaign is about. Next, you 
have to decide how you want to run your campaign. 
What's the right way to run a campaign? That depends 
on your play style and the motivations of your players. 
Consider your players' tastes, your strengths as a 
DM, table rules (discussed in part 3), and the type of 
game you want to run. Describe to the players how you 
envision the game experience and let them give you 
input. The game is theirs, too. Lay that groundwork 
early, so your players can make informed choices and 
help you maintain the type of game you want to run. 
Consider the following two exaggerated examples of 
play style. 
HACK AND SLASH 
The adventurers kick in the dungeon door, fight the 
monsters , and grab the treasure. This style of play is 
straightforward , fun, exciting, and action-oriented. The 
players spend relatively little time developing personas 
for their characters , roleplaying noncombat situations , 
or discussing anything other than the immediate 
dangers of the dungeon. 
In such a game, the adventurers face clearly evil 
monsters and opponents and occasionally meet clearly 
good and helpful NPCs. Don't expect the adventurers 
to anguish over what to do with prisoners, or to debate 
whether it's right or wrong to invade and wipe out a 
bugbear lair. Don't track money or time spent in town. 
Once they've completed a task, send the adventurers 
back into the action as quickly as possible. Character 
motivation need be no more developed than a desire to 
kill monsters and acquire treasure. 
lMMERSIVE STORYTELLING 
Waterdeep is threatened by political turmoil. The 
adventurers must convince the Masked Lords, the city's 
secret rulers, to resolve their differences, but can do so 
A WORLD TO EXPLORE 
Much of a campaign involves the adventurers traveling from 
place to place, exploring the environment , and learning 
about the fantasy world. This exploration can take place in 
any environment, including a vast wilderness, a labyrinthine 
dungeon, the shadowy passages of the Underdark, the 
crowded streets of a city, and the undulating waters of 
the sea. Determining a way around an obstacle, finding a 
hidden object, investigating a strange feature of a dungeon, 
deciphering clues, solving puzzles, and bypassing or 
disabling traps can all be part of exploration. 
Sometimes exploration is an incidental part of the game. 
For instance, you might gloss over an unimportant journey 
by telling the players that they spend three uneventful days 
on the road before moving along to the next point of interest. 
Other times exploration is the focus, a chance to describe 
a wondrous part of the world or story that increases the 
players' feeling of immersion. Similarly, you should consider 
playing up exploration if your players enjoy solving puzzles, 
finding their way around obstacles, and searching dungeon 
corridors for secret doors. 
CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN ,. only after both the characters and the lords have come 
to terms with their differing outlooks and agendas. 
This style of gaming is deep, complex, and challenging. 
The focus isn't on combat but on negotiations, political 
maneuverings, and character interaction. A whole game 
session might pass without a single attack roll. 
In this style of game, the NPCs are as complex and 
richly detailed as the adventurers, although the focus 
lies on motivation and personality, not game statistics. 
Expect long digressions from each player about what 
his or her character does, and why. Going to a temple to 
ask a priest for advice can be as important an encounter 
as fighting orcs. (And don't expect the adventurers to 
fight the orcs at all unless they are motivated to do 
so.) A character will sometimes take actions against 
the player's better judgment , because "that's what the 
character would do." 
Since combat isn't the focus, game rules take a back 
seat to character development. Ability check modifiers 
and skill proficiencies take precedence over combat 
bonuses. Feel free to change or ignore rules to fit the 
players' roleplaying needs, using the advice presented in 
part 3 of this book. 
SOMETHING IN BETWEEN 
The style of play in most campaigns falls between these 
two extremes . There's plenty of action, but the campaign 
offers an ongoing storyline and interaction between 
characters as well. Players develop their characters ' 
motivations and relish the chance to prove their skills 
in combat. To maintain the balance, provide a mixture 
of roleplaying encounters and combat encounters. Even 
in a dungeon setting, you can present NPCs that aren't 
meant to be fought but rather helped out, negotiated 
with, or just talked to. 
Think about your preferred style of play by 
considering these questions: 
• Are you a fan of realism and gritty consequen ces, or 
are you more focused on making the game seem like 
an action movie? 
• Do you want the game to maintain a sense of medieval 
fantasy, or do you want to explore alternate time lines 
or modern thinking? 
Do you want to maintain a serious tone, or is humor 
your goal? 
• Even if you are serious, is the action lighthearted 
or intense? 
• Is bold action key, or do the players need to be 
thoughtful and cautious? 
Do you like to plan thoroughly in advance, or do you 
prefer improvising on the spot? 
• Is the game full of varied D&D elements , or does it 
center on a theme such as horror? 
• Is the game for all ages, or does it involve 
mature themes? 
Are you comfortable with moral ambiguity, such as 
allowing the characters to explore whether the end 
justifies the means? Or are you happier with straight­
forward heroic principles , such as justice, sacrifice, 
and helping the downtrodden? 

CHARACTER NAMES 
Part of your campaign style has to do with naming 
characters . It's a good idea to establish some ground 
rules with your players at the start of a new campaign. 
In a group consisting of Sithis, Travok, Anastrianna , 
and Kairon, the human fighter named Bob II sticks out, 
especially when he's identical to Bob I, who was killed 
by kobolds. If everyone takes a lighthearted approach 
to names, that's fine. If the group would rather take the 
characters and their names a little more seriously , urge 
Bob's player to come up with a more appropriate name. 
Player character names should match each other 
in flavor or concept, and they should also match the 
flavor of your campaign world-so should the non player 
characters ' names and place names you create. Travok 
and Kairon don't want to undertake a quest for Lord 
Cupcake, visit Gumdrop Island, or take down a crazy 
wizard named Ray. 
CONTINUING OR 
EPISODIC CAMPAIGNS 
The backbone of a campaign is a connected series 
of adventures , but you can connect them in two 
different ways. 
In a continuing campaign , the connected adventures 
share a sense of a larger purpose or a recurring 
theme (or themes). The adventures might feature 
returning villains, grand conspiracies, or a single 
mastermind who's ultimately behind every adventure 
of the campaign. 
A continuing campaign designed with a theme and 
a story arc in mind can feel like a great fantasy epic. 
The players derive the satisfaction of knowing the 
actions they take during one adventure matter in the 
next. Plotting and running that kind of campaign can 
be demanding on the DM, but the payoff is a great and 
memorab le story. 
An episodic campaign, in contrast, is like a television 
show where each week's episode is a self-contained 
story that doesn't play into any overarching plot. It 
might be built on a premise that explains its nature: the 
player characters are adventurers-for-hire, or explorers 
venturing into the unknown and facing a string of 
unrelated dangers. They might even be archaeologists , 
venturing into one ancient ruin after another in search 
of artifacts. An episodic game like this lets you create 
adventures-or buy published ones-and drop them into 
your campaign without worrying about how they fit with 
the adventures that came before and follow after. 
CAMPAIGN THEME 
A theme in a campaign, as in a work of literature , 
expresses the deeper meaning of a story and the 
fundamental elements of human experience that the 
story explores. Your campaign doesn't have to be a work 
of literature, but it can still draw on common themes 
that lend a distinctive flavor to its stories. Consider 
these examples: 
CHAPTER I I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN A campaign about confronting the inevitability of 
mortality , whether embodied in undead monsters or 
expressed through the death of loved ones. 
A campaign revolving around an insidious evil, 
whether dark gods, monstrous races such as the 
yuan-ti, or creatures of unknown realms far removed 
from mortal concerns. As heroes confront this evil, 
they must face the selfish, cold tendencies of their own 
kind as well. 
A campaign featuring troubled heroes who confront 
not only the savagery of the bestial creatures of the 
world, but also the beast within-the rage and fury 
that lies in their own hearts. 
A campaign exploring the insatiable thirst for power 
and domination , whether embodied by the hosts of the 
Nine Hells or by humanoid rulers bent on conquering 
the world. 
With a theme such as "confrontation with mortality, " 
you can craft a broad range of adventures that aren't 
necessarily connected by a common villain. One 
adventure might feature the dead bursting from their 
graves and threatening to overwhelm a whole town. 
In the next adventure , a mad wizard creates a flesh 
golem in an effort to revive his lost love. A villain could 
go to extreme lengths to achieve immortality to avoid 
confronting its own demise. The adventurers might 
help a ghost accept death and move on, or one of the 
adventurers might even become a ghost! 
VARIATIONS ON A THEME 
Mixing things up once in a while allows your players 
to enjoy a variety of adventures. Even a tightly themed 
campaign can stray now and then. If your campaign 
heavily involves intrigue, mystery, and roleplaying , your 
players might enjoy the occasional dungeon crawl­
especially if the tangent is revealed to relate to a larger 
plot irr the campaign. If most of your adventures are 
dungeon expeditions, shift gears with a tense urban 
mystery that eventually leads the party into a dungeon 
crawl in an abandoned building or tower. If you run 
horror adventures week after week, try using a villain 
who turns out to be ordinary, perhaps even silly. Comic 
relief is a great variation on almost any D&D campaign, 
though players usually provide it themselves. 
TIERS OF PLAY 
As characters grow in power, their ability to change the 
world around them grows with them. It helps to think 
ahead when creating your campaign to account for this 
change. As the characters make a greater impact on the 
world, they face greater danger whether they want to 
or not. Powerful factions see them as a threat and plot 
against them, while friendly ones court their favor in 
hopes of striking a useful alliance. 
The tiers of play represent the ideal milestones for 
introducing new world-shaking events to the campaign . 
As the characters resolve one event, a new danger 
arises or the prior trouble transforms into a new threat 
in response to the characters' actions. Events.need to 
grow in magnitude and scope, increasing the stakes and 
drama as the characters become increasingly powerful. 
This approach also allows you to break your design 
work down into smaller pieces. Create material such 
as adventures , NPCs, maps, and so on for one tier at 
a time. You only need to worry about the details of the 
next tier as the characters approach it. Even better, as 
the campaign takes unexpected turns in response to the 
players' choices, you don't have to worry about redoing 
much work. 
LEVELS 1-4: LOCAL HEROES 
Characters in this tier are still learning the range of 
class features that define them, including their choice 
of specialization. But even 1st-level characters are 
heroes, set apart from the common people by natural 
characteristics, learned skills, and the hint of a greater 
destiny that lies before them. 
At the start of their careers, characters use 1st-
and 2nd-level spells and wield mundane gear. The 
magic items they find include common consumabl e 
items (potions and scrolls) and a very few uncommon 
permanent items. Their magic can have a big impact in 
a single encounter , but it doesn't change the course of an 
adventure. 
The fate of a village might hang on the success or 
failure of low-level adventurers , who trust their lives 
to their fledgling abilities. These characters navigate 
dangerous terrain and explore haunted crypts, where 
they can expect to fight savage orcs, ferocious wolves, 
giant spiders, evil cultists, bloodthirsty ghouls, and 
hired thugs. If they face even a young dragon, they're 
better off avoiding a fight. 
LEVELS 5-10: HEROES OF THE REALM 
By the time they reach this tier, adventurers have 
mastered the basics of their class features, though they 
continue to improve throughout these levels. They have 
found their place in the world and have begun to involve 
themselves in the dangers that surround them. 
Dedicated spellcasters learn 3rd-level spells at the 
start of this tier. Suddenly characters can fly, damage 
large numbers of foes with fireball and lightning bolt 
pells, and even breathe underwater. They master 
5th-level spells by the end of the tier, and spells such 
as teleportation circle, scrying, flame strike, legend 
lore, and raise dead can have a significant impact on 
their adventures. They start acquiring more permanent 
magic items (uncommon and rare ones) as well, which 
will serve them for the rest of their careers. 
The fate of a region might depend on the adventures 
that characters of levels 5 to 10 undertake. These 
adventurers venture into fearsome wilds and ancient 
ruins, where they confront savage giants, ferocious 
hydras, fearless golems, evil yuan-ti, scheming devils, 
bloodthirsty demons, crafty mind flayers, and drow 
assassins. They might have a chance of defeating a 
young dragon that has established a lair but not yet 
extended its reach far into the surrounding territory. LEVELS 11-16: MASTERS OF THE 
REALM 
By 11th level, characters are shining examples of 
courage and determination-true paragons in the world, 
set well apart from the masses. At this tier, adventurers 
are far more versatile than they were at lower levels, and 
they can usually find the right tool for a given challenge. 
Dedicated spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells 
at 11th level, including spells that completely change 
the way adventurers interact with the world. Their big, 
flashy spells are significant in combat-disintegrate , 
blade barrier, and heal, for example -but behind-the­
scenes spells such as word of recall, find the path, 
contingency, teleport, and true seeing alter the way 
players approach their adventures. Each spell level after 
that point introduces new effects with an equally large 
impact. The adventurers find rare magic items (and very 
rare ones) that bestow similarly powerful abilities. 
The fate of a nation or even the world depends on 
momentous quests that such characters undertake . 
Adventurers explore uncharted regions and delve into 
long-forgotten dungeons, where they confront terrible 
masterminds of the lower planes, cunning rakshasas 
and beholders, and hungry purple worms. They might 
encounter and even defeat a powerful adult dragon 
that has established a lair and a significant presence in 
the world. 
At this tier, adventurers make their mark on the 
world in a variety of ways, from the consequences of 
their adventures to the manner in which they spend 
their hard-won treasure and exploit their well-deserved 
reputations. Characters of this level construct fortresses 
on land deeded them by local rulers. They found guilds, 
temples, or martial orders. They take on apprentices 
or students of their own. They broker peace between 
nations or lead them into war. And their formidable 
reputations attract the attention of very powerful foes. 
LEVELS 17-20: MASTERS OF THE 
WORLD 
By 17th level, characters have superheroic capabilities , 
and their deeds and adventures are the stuff of legend. 
Ordinary people can hardly dream of such heights of 
power-or such terrible dangers. 
Dedicated spellcasters at this tier wield earthshaking 
9th-level spells such as wish, gate, storm of vengeance , 
and astral projection. Characters have several rare 
and very rare magic items at their disposal, and begin 
discovering legendary items such as a vorpal sword or a 
staff of the magi. 
Adventures at these levels have far-reaching 
consequences , possibly determining the fate of 
millions in the Material Plane and even places beyond. 
Characters traverse otherworldly realms and explore 
demiplanes and other extraplanar locales, where they 
fight savage bator demons, titans, archdevils , lich 
archmages , and even avatars of the gods themselves. 
The dragons they encounter are wyrms of tremendous 
power, whose sleep troubles kingdoms and whose 
waking threatens existence itself. 
CHAPTER l I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN 37 
g8 Characters who reach 20th level have attained 
the pinnacle of mortal achievement. Their deeds are 
recorded in the annals of history and recounted by 
bards for centuries. Their ultimate destinies come to 
pass. A cleric might be taken up into the heavens to 
serve as a god's right hand. A warlock could become 
a patron to other warlocks. Perhaps a wizard unlocks 
the secret to immortality (or undeath) and spends eons 
exploring the farthest reaches of the multiverse . A druid 
might become one with the land, transforming into a 
nature spirit of a particular place or an aspect of the 
wild. Other characters could found clans or dynasties 
that revere the memory of their honored ancestors 
from generation to generation, create masterpi eces of 
epic literature that are sung and retold for thousands 
of years, or establish guilds or orders that keep the 
adventurers' principles and dreams alive. 
Reaching this point doesn't necessarily dictate the 
end of the campaign . These powerful characters might 
be called on to undertake grand adventures on the 
cosmic stage. And as a result of these adventures, their 
capabilities can continue to evolve. Characters gain no 
more levels at this point, but they can still advance in 
meaningful ways and continue performing epic deeds 
that resound throughout the multiverse . Chapter 7 
details epic boons you can use as rewards for these 
characters to maintain a sense of progress. 
STARTING AT HIGHER LEVEL -----
Experienced players familiar with the capabilities of 
the character classes and impatient for more significant 
adventures might welcome the idea of starting a 
campaign with characters above 1st level. Creating a 
higher-level character uses the same character creation 
steps outlined in the Player's Handbook. Such a 
character has more hit points, class features, and spells, 
and probably starts with better equipment. 
Starting equipment for characters above 1st level is 
entirely at your discretion, since you give out treasure 
at your own pace. That said, you can use the Starting 
Equipment table as a guide. 
STARTING EQUIPMENT FLAVORS OF FANTASY 
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is a fantasy game, but that broad 
category encompasses a lot of variety. Many different 
flavors of fantasy exist in fiction and film. Do you want 
a horrific campaign inspired by the works of H. P. 
Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith? Or do you envision a 
world of muscled barbarians and nimble thieves, along 
the lines of the classic sword-and-sorcery books by 
Robert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber? Your choice can 
have a impact on the flavor of your campaign. 
HEROIC FANTASY 
~~------------------
Heroic fantasy is the baseline assumed by the D&D 
rules. The Player's Handbook describes this baseline: 
a multitude of humanoid races coexist with humans in 
fantastic worlds. Adventurers bring magical powers to 
bear against the monstrous threats they face. These 
characters typically come from ordinary backgrounds, 
but something impels them into an adventuring life. The 
adventurers are the "heroes" of the campaign, but they 
might not be truly heroic, instead pursuing this life for 
selfish reasons. Technology and society are based on 
medieval norms, though the culture isn't necessarily 
European. Campaigns often revolve around delving into 
ancient dungeons in search of treasure or in an effort to 
destroy monsters or villains. 
This genre is also common in fantasy fiction. Most 
novels set in the Forgotten Realms are best described as 
heroic fantasy, following in the footsteps of many of the 
authors listed in appendix E of the Player's Handbook. 
SwoRD AND SoRCERY 
A grim, hulking fighter disembowels the high priest 
of the serpent god on his own altar. A laughing rogue 
spends ill-gotten gains on cheap wine in filthy taverns. 
Hardy adventurers venture into the unexplored jungle in 
search of the fabled City of Golden Masks. 
A sword-and-sorcery campaign emulates some of the 
classic works of fantasy fiction, a tradition that goes 
back to the roots of the game. Here you'll find a dark, 
gritty world of evil sorcerers and decadent cities, where

uch a campaign can draw on the myths and legends 
c any culture, not just the familiar Greek tales. 
DARK FANTASY 
Vampires brood on the battlements of their accursed 
castles. Necromancers toil in dark dungeons to create 
horrid servants made of dead flesh. Devils corrupt the 
innocent, and werewolves prowl the night. All of these 
elements evoke horrific aspects of the fantasy genre. 
If you want to put a horror spin on your campaign, 
you have plenty of material to work with. The Monster 
Manual is full of creatures that perfectly suit a storyline 
of supernatura l horror. The most important element of 
such a campaign , though, isn't covered by the rules. A 
dark-fantasy setting requires an atmosphere of building 
dread, created through careful pacing and evocative 
description. Your players contribute too; they have to 
be willing to embrace the mood you're trying to evoke. 
Whether you want to run a full-fledged dark-fantasy 
campaign or a single creepy adventure , you should 
discuss your plans with the players ahead of time to 
make sure they're on board. Horror can be intense 
and personal, and not everyone is comfortable with 
such a game. 
Novels and game products set in Ravenloft, the 
Demiplane of Dread, explore dark-fantasy elements in a 
D&D context. 
INTRIGUE 
The corrupt vizier schemes with the baron's oldest 
daughter to assassinate the baron. A hobgoblin army 
sends doppelganger spies to infiltrate the city before the 
invasion. At the embassy ball, the spy in the royal court 
makes contact with his employer . 
Political intrigue, espionage , sabotage , and similar 
cloak-and-dagger activities can provide the basis for 
an exciting D&D campaign. In this kind of game, the 
characters might care more about skill training and 
making contacts than about attack spells and magic 
weapons. Roleplaying and social interaction take on 
greater importance than combat, and the party might go 
for several sessions without seeing a monster. 
Again, make sure your players know ahead of time 
that you want to run this kind of campaign. Otherwise, 
a player might create a defense-focused dwarf paladin, 
only to find he is out of place among half-elf diplomats 
and tiefling spies. 
The Brimstone Angels novels by Erin M. Evans focus 
on intrigue in the Forgotten Realms setting, from the 
backstabbing politics of the Nine Hells to the contested 
s_uccession of Cormyrean royalty. MYSTERY 
Who stole three legendary magic weapons and hid them 
away in a remote dungeon, leaving a cryptic clue to their 
location? Who placed the duke into a magical slumber, 
and what can be done to awaken him? Who murdered 
the guildmaster , and how did the killer get into the 
guild's locked vault? 
A mystery-themed campaign puts the characters in 
the role of investigators, perhaps traveling from town 
to town to crack tough cases the local authorities can't 
handle. Such a campaign emphasizes puzzles and 
problem-solving in addition to combat prowess. 
A larger mystery might even set the stage for the 
whole campaign. Why did someone kill the characters' 
mentor, setting them on the path of adventure? Who 
really controls the Cult of the Red Hand? In this case, 
the characters might uncover clues to the greater 
mystery only once in a while; individual adventures 
might be at best tangentially related to that theme. A 
diet of nothing but puzzles can become frustrating, so 
be sure to mix up the kinds of encounters you present. 
Novels in various D&D settings have explored the 
mystery genre with a fantasy twist. In particular , Murder 
in Cormyr (by Chet Williamson), Murder in Halruaa (by 
Richard S. Meyers), and Spellstorm (by Ed Greenwood) 
are mysteries set in the Forgotten Realms. Murder 
in Tarsis (by John Maddox Roberts) takes the same 
approach in the Dragonlance setting. 
SWASHBUCKLING 
Rapier-wielding sailors fight off boarding sahuagin. 
Ghouls lurk in derelict ships, waiting to devour treasure 
hunters. Dashing rogues and charming paladins weave 
their way through palace intrigues and leap from 
balconies onto waiting horses below. 
The swashbuckling adventures of pirates and 
musketeers suggest opportunities for a dynamic 
campaign. The characters typically spend more 
time in cities, royal courts, and seafaring vessels 
than in dungeon delves, making interaction skills 
important (though not to the extent of a pure intrigue 
campaign). Nevertheless , the heroes might end up in 
classic dungeon situations, such as searching storm 
sewers beneath the palace to find the evil duke's 
hidden chambers. 
A good example of a swashbuckling rogue in the 
Forgotten Realms is Jack Ravenwild , who appears in 
novels by Richard Baker (City of Ravens and Prince 
of Ravens). 
WAR 
A hobgoblin army marches toward the city, leading 
elephants and giants to batter down the stronghold's 
walls and ramparts . Dragons wheel above a barbarian 
horde, scattering enemies as the raging warriors 
cut a swath through field and forest. Salamanders 
muster at an efreeti's command, poised to assault an 
astral fortress.

CROSSING THE STREAMS 
The renowned paladin Murlynd, from the world of 
Oerth (as featured in Greyhawk novels and game

Old West and wears a pair of six-shooters strapped

Somewhere in the Barrier Peaks of Oerth, the wreckage

lifeforms and strange items of technology on board. And

Deep in D&D's roots are elements of science 
fiction and science fantasy, and your campaign might 
draw on those sources as well. It's okay to send your 
characters hurtling through a magic mirror to Lewis 
Carroll's Wonderland, put them aboard a ship traveling 
between the stars, or set your campaign in a far-future 
world where laser blasters and magic missiles exist 
side by side. The possibilities are limitless. Chapter 
9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop ," provides tools for 
exploring those possibilities.

HAPTER 2: CREATING A MULTIVERSE 
lHEN ADVENTURERS REACH HIGHER LEVELS, 
their path extends to other dimensions of 
reality: the planes of existence that form the 
multiverse. The characters might be called 
on to rescue a friend from the horrific depths 
of the Abyss or to sail the shining waters of 
the River Oceanus. They can hoist a tankard 
-lhe friendly giants ofYsgard or face the chaos of 
-bo to contact a wizened githzerai sage. 
::>Janes of existence define the extremes of strange

d. Planar adventures offer unprecedented dangers 
- . ·onders. Adventurers walk on streets made of solid 
or test their mettle on a battlefield where the fallen 
;-e urrected with each dawn. 
: :arious planes of existence are realms of myth 
mystery. They're not simply other worlds, but 
-ensions formed and governed by spiritual and 
~ ental principles. 
-e Outer Planes are realms of spirituality and

-merely a place where good creatures dwell, and not

. hen they die. It is the plane of goodness, a spiritual 
where evil can't flourish. It is as much a state of 
-a and of mind as it is a physical location. 
e Inner Planes exemplify the physical essence 
-elemental nature of air, earth, fire, and water. 
--Elemental Plane of Fire, for example, embodies 
~ e ence of fire. The plane's entire substance is = ed with the fundamental nature of fire: energy, 
--·on, transformation , and destruction. Even objects 
: lid brass or basalt seem to dance with flame, in a 
ilile and palpable manifestation of the vibrancy of 
· dominion. 
-lhis context, the Material Plane is the nexus where 
· ese philosophical and elemental forces collide in 
:umbled existence of mortal life and matter. The 
- d of D&D exist within the Material Plane, making 
e starting point for most campaigns and adventures. 
--e rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the 
.,-erial Plane. 
l: ..... A.NAR CATEGORIES 
--e planes of the default D&D cosmology are grouped 
--:he following categories : 
e Material Plane and Its Echoes. The Feywild and 
·· e Shadowfell are reflections of the Material Plane. 
e Transitive Planes. The Ethereal Plane and the 
. · tral Plane are mostly featureless planes that 
: rve primarily as pathways to travel from one plane 
•o another. The Inner Planes. The four Elemental Planes (Air, 
Earth, Fire, and Water), plus the Elemental Chaos that 
surrounds them, are the Inner Planes. 
The Outer Planes. Sixteen Outer Planes correspond 
to the eight non-neutral alignments and shades of 
philosophical difference between them. 
The Positive and Negative Planes. These two planes 
enfold the rest of the cosmology , providing the raw 
forces of life and death that underlie the rest of 
existence in the multiverse. 
PUTTING THE PLANES TOGETHER 
As described in the Player's Handbook , the assumed 
D&D cosmology includes more than two dozen planes. 
For your campaign, you decide what planes to include, 
inspired by the standard planes, drawn from Earth's 
myths, or created by your own imagination. 
At minimum , most D&D campaigns require 
these elements: 
• A plane of origin for fiends 
A plane of origin for celestials 
A plane of origin for elementals 
• A place for deities, which might include any or all of 
the previous three 
The place where mortal spirits go after death, which 
might include any or all of the first three 
A way of getting from one plane to another 
A way for spells and monsters that use the Astral 
Plane and the Ethereal Plane to function 
Once you've decided on the planes you want to use in 
your campaign , putting them into a coherent cosmology 
is an optional step. Since the primary way of traveling 
from plane to plane, even using the Transitive Planes, 
is through magical portals that link planes together, the 
exact relationship of different planes to one another is 
largely a theoretical concern. No being in the multiverse 
can look down and see the planes in their arrangement 
the same way as we look at a diagram in a book. No 
mortal can verify whether Mount Celestia is sandwiched 
between Bytopia and Arcadia, but it's a convenient 
theoretical construct based on the philosophical 
shading among the three planes and the relative 
importance they give to law and good. 
Sages have constructed a few such theoretical models 
to make sense of the jumble of planes, particularly the 
Outer Planes. The three most common are the Great 
INVENTING YOUR OWN PLANES 
Each of the planes described in this chapter has at least 
one significant effect on travelers who venture there. When 
you design your own planes, it's a good idea to stick to 
that model. Create one simple trait that players notice, that 
doesn't create too much complication at the gaming table, 
and that's easy to remember. Try to reflect the philosophy and 
mood of the place, not merely its physical characteristics . 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULT!VERSE 
43 
Wheel, the World Tree, and the World Axis , but you 
can create or adapt whatever model works best for the 
planes you want to use in your game. 
THE GREAT WHEEL 
The default cosmological arrangement presented 
in the Player's Handbook visualizes the planes as a 
group of concentric wheels, with the Material Plane 
and its echoes at the center. The Inner Planes form 
a wheel around the Material Plane, enveloped in the 
Ethereal Plane. Then the Outer Planes form another 
wheel around and behind (or above or below) that one, 
arranged according to alignment, with the Outlands 
linking them all. 
This arrangement makes sense of the way the River 
Styx flows among the Lower Planes, connecting 
Acheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the 
Abyss, and Pandemonium like beads on a string. But it's 
not the only possible explanation of the river's course. 
THE WORLD TREE 
A different arrangement of planes envisions them 
situated among the roots and branches of a great cosmic 
tree, literally or figuratively. 
For example, the Norse cosmology centers on the 
World Tree Yggdrasil. The three roots of the World 
Tree touch the three realms: Asgard (an Outer Plane 
that includes Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, and other 
regions), Midgard (the Material Plane), and Niflheim 
(the underworld). The Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, 
is a unique transitive plane that connects Asgard 
and Midgard. 
Similarly , one vision of the planes where the deities 
of the Forgotten Realms reside situates a number of 
celestial planes in the branches of a World Tree, while 
the fiendish planes are linked by a River of Blood. 
Neutral planes stand apart from them. Each of these 
planes is primarily the domain of one or more deities, 
though they are also the homes of celestial and fiendish 
creatures. 
THE WORLD AxiS 
In this view of the cosmos, the Material Plane and its 
echoes stand between two opposing realms. The Astral 
Plane (or Astral Sea) floats above them, holding any 
number of divine domains (the Outer Planes). Below 
the Material Plane is the Elemental Chaos, a single, 
undifferentiated elemental plane where all the elements 
clash together. At the bottom of the Elemental Chaos is 
the Abyss, like a hole torn in the fabric of the cosmos. 
OTHER VISIONS 
As you build your own cosmology , consider the 
following alternatives . 
The Omniverse. This simple cosmology covers the 
bare minimum: a Material Plane; the Transitive Planes; 
a single Elemental Chaos; an Overheaven , where good­
aligned deities and celestials live; and the Underworld , 
where evil deities and fiends live. 
Myriad Planes. In this cosmology , countless planes 
clump together like soap bubbles, intersecting with each 
other more or less at random. 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A Mt.:LTI\ ERSE The Orrery. All the Inner and Outer Planes orbit the 
Material Plane, exerting greater or lesser influence on 
the world as they come nearer and farther. The world of 
Eberron uses this cosmological model. 
The Winding Road. In this cosmology, every plane is 
a stop along an infinite road. Each plane is adjacent to 
two others, but there's no necessary cohesion between 
adjacent planes; a traveler can walk from the slopes of 
Mount Celestia onto the slopes of Gehenna. 
Mount Olympus. In the Greek cosmology, Mount 
Olympus stands at the center of the world (the Material 
Plane), with its peak so high that it's actually another 
plane of existence : Olympus, the home of the gods. All 
the Greek gods except Hades have their own domains 
within Olympus. In Hades, named for its ruler, mortal 
souls linger as insubstantial shades until they eventually 
fade into nothing. Tartarus , where the titans are 
imprisoned in endless darkness, lies below Hades. And 
far to the west of the known world in the Material Plane 
are the blessed Elysian Fields. The souls of great heroes 
reside there. 
Solar Barge. The Egyptian cosmology is defined by 
the daily path of the sun-across the sky of the Material 
Plane, down to the fair Offering Fields in the west, 
where the souls of the righteous live in eternal reward, 
and then beneath the world through the nightmarish 
Twelve Hours of Night. The Solar Barge is a tiny Outer 
Plane in its own right, though it exists within the Astral 
Plane and the other Outer Planes in the different stages 
of its journey. 
One World. In this model, there are no other 
planes of existence, but the Material Plane includes 
places like the bottomless Abyss, the shining Mount 
Celestia, the strange city of Mechanus , the fortress of 
Acheron, and so on. All the planes are locations in the 
wodd, reachable by ordinary means of travel-though 
extraordinary effort is required , for example, to sail 
across the sea to the blessed isles of Elysium. 
The Otherworld. In this model, the Material Plane 
has a twin realm that fills the role of all the other planes. 
Much like the Feywild, it overlays the Material Plane 
and can be reached through "thin places" where the 
worlds are particularly close: through caves, by sailing 
far across the sea, or in fairy rings in remote forests. It 
has dark, evil regions (homes of fiends and evil gods), 
sacred isles (homes of celestials and the spirits of the 
blessed death), and realms of elemental fury. This 
otherworld is sometimes overseen by an eternal city, or 
by four cities that each represent a different aspect of 
reality. The Celtic cosmology has an otherworld , called 
Tfr na n6g, and the cosmologies of some religions 
inspired by Asian myth have a similar Spirit World. 
PLANAR TRAVEL 
When adventurers travel to other planes of existence, 
they undertake a legendary journey that might force 
them to face supernatural guardians and undergo 
various ordeals. The nature of that journey and the trials 
along the way depend in part on the means of travel, and 
whether the adventurers find a magic portal or use a 
spell to carry them. 
"PLANAR PORTALS 
• aistlin's] eyes studied the Portal, studied every detail

nnection that links a specific location on one plane 
a pecific location on another. Some portals function

? ing through a planar portal can be the simplest 
_-w travel from the Material Plane to a desired 
arion on another plane. Most of the time, though, a 
:tal presents an adventure in itself. 
:=-t. the adventurers must find a portal that leads 
ere they want to go. Most portals exist in distant 
ations, and a portal's location often has thematic 
-arities to the plane it leads to. For example, a portal 
-e heavenly mountain of Celestia might be located 
a mountain peak. 
-cond, portals often have guardians charged with 
illfing that undesirable people don't pass through. 
:;>ending on the portal's destination, "undesirable 
-pie·· might include evil characters, good characters , 
:ards, thieves, anyone wearing a robe, or any mortal 
-e ture. A portal's guardian is typically a powerful 
-· gical creature, such as a genie, sphinx, titan, or 
.-e of the portal's destination plane. 
-=-mally, most portals don't stand open all the time, 
_-open only in particular situations or when a certain 
_ ·rement is met. A portal can have any conceivab le 
-ement, but the following are the most common: 
e. The portal functions only at particular times: 
ilfing a full moon on the Material Plane, or every ten 
y . or when the stars are in a particular position. 
nee it opens, such a portal remains open for a 
ired time, such as for three days following the full 
~n. or for an hour, or for ld4 + 1 rounds. 
--ation. The portal functions only if a particular 
ondition is met. A situation-keyed portal opens on a clear night, or when it rains, or when a certain 
spell is cast in its vicinity . 
Random. A random portal functions for a random 
period, then shuts down for a similarly random 
duration. Typically, such a portal allows ld6 + 
6 travelers to pass through, then shuts down 
for ld6 days. 
Command Word. The portal functions only if a 
particular command word is spoken. Sometimes the 
word must be spoken as a character passes through 
the portal (which is otherwise a mundane doorway , 
window, or similar opening) . Other portals open when 
the command word is spoken and remain open for a 
short time. 
Key. The portal functions if the traveler is holding a 
particular object; the item acts much like a key to 
ll. door. This key item can be a common object or a 
particular key created for that portal. The city of Sigil 
above the Outlands is known as the City of Doors 
because it features an overwhelming number of such 
item-keyed portals. 
Learning and meeting a portal's requirements can 
draw characters into further adventures as they chase 
down a key item, scour old libraries for command 
words, or consult sages to find the right time 
to visit the portal. 
SPELLS 
Sa~ya raised her hands and began to declaim the words of 
a very powerful spell, one of the most dangerous she knew, 
a spell designed to breach the barriers between the planes 
and create a magical bridge into another realm of existence. 
The myth a/ thrummed in response, the intangible pulse of 
the old device taking on a new and different note. Sarya 
ignored the myth a/ stone's change and pressed on, finishing 
her gate spell with skill and confidence. 
"The gate is open!" she cried. "Malkizid, come forth!" 
Before Sarya a great ring or hoop of golden magic 
coalesced from the air. Through it she glimpsed the realm 
of Malkizid, an infernal wasteland of parched desert, 
windswept rifts, and black, angry skies torn by crimson 
lightning. Then, through the gate, the archdevil Malkizid 
appeared . With one smooth step he crossed from his 
infernal plane into the myth a/ chamber. 
-Richard Baker, Farthest Reach 
A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to 
other planes of existence . Plane shift and gate can 
directly transport adventurers to any other plane, with 
different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows 
adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane. And the astral 
projection spell lets adventurers project themselves 
into the Astral Plane and from there travel to the 
Outer Planes. 
Plane Shift. The plane shift spell has two important 
limitations . The first is the material component: a 
small, forked, metal rod (like a tuning fork) attuned to 
the desired planar destinati on. The spell requires the 
proper resonating frequency to home in on the correct 
location, and the fork must be made of the right material 
(sometimes a complex alloy) to focus the spell's magic 
properly. Crafting the fork is expensive (at least 250 gp), 
but even the act of researching the correct specifications 
can lead to adventure. After all. not many people 
voluntarily travel into the depth of Carceri, so very few 
know what kind of tuning fork i required to get there. 
Second, the spell doesn't end the caster to a specific 
location unless he or she ha pecialize d information. 
The sigil sequence of a teleponation circle located on 
another plane allows the ca rer ro travel directly to that 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A E circle, but such knowledge is even harder to come 
by than the specifications of the required tuning 
fork. Otherwise, the spell transports the caster to 
a location in the general vicinity of the desired spot. 
Wherever the adventurers arrive, they'll most likely 
still need to undertake a journey to reach the object of a 
planar quest. 
Gate. The gate spell opens a portal linked to a specific 
point on another plane of existence. The spell provides 
a shortcut to a planar destination, bypassing many of 
the guardians and trials that would normally fill such 
a journey. But this 9th-level spell is out of reach for all 
but the most powerful characters, and it does nothing to 
negate any obstacles that wait at the destination. 
The gate spell is powerful, but not infallible. A deity, 
demon lord, or other powerful entity can prevent such a 
portal from opening within its dominion. 
ASTRAL PLANE 
Halisstra opened her eyes and found herself drifting in 
an endless silver sea. Soft gray clouds moved slowly in 
the distance , while strange dark streaks twisted violently 
through the sky, anchored in ends so distant she couldn't 
perceive them, their middle parts revolving angrily like 
pieces of string rolled between a child'sfingertips. She 
glanced down, wondering what supported her, and saw 
nothing but more of the strange pearly sky beneath her feet 
and all around her. 
She drew in a sudden breath, surprised by the sight, and 
felt her lungs fill with something sweeter and perhaps a l ittle 
more solid than air, but instead of gagging or drowning 
on the stuff she seemed perfectly acclimated to it. An 
electric thrill raced through her limbs as she found herself 
mesmerized by the simple act of respiration. 
-Richard Baker, Condemna tio 
The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, 
where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach 
the Outer Planes. It is a great silvery sea, the same 
above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray 
streaking among motes of light like distant stars. Most 
of the Astral Sea is a vast, empty expanse. Visitors 
occasionally stumble upon the petrified corpse of a 
dead god or other chunks of rock drifting forever in the 
silvery void. Much more commonp lace are color pools­
magical pools of colored light that flicker like radiant, 
spinning coins. 
Creatures on the Astral Plane don't age or suffer from 
hunger or thirst. For this reason, humanoids that live 
on the Astral Plane (such as the githyanki) establish 
outposts on other planes, often the Material Plane, so 
their children can grow to maturity. 
A traveler in the Astral Plane can move by simply 
thinking about moving, but distance has little meaning. 
In combat, though, a creature's walking.speed (in feet) is 
equal to 3 x its Intelligence score. The smarter a creature 
is, the easier it can control its movement by act of will. 
ASTRAL PROJECTION 
Traveling through the Astral Plane by means of 
the astral projection spell involves projecting one's 
consciousness there, usually in search of a gateway to an 
Outer Plane to visit. Since the Outer Planes are as much 
spiritual states of being as they are physical places, this 
allows a character to manifest in an Outer Plane as if he 
or she had physically traveled there, but as in a dream. 
A character's death-either in the Astral Plane or on 
the destination plane-causes no actual harm. Only the 
severing of a character 's silver cord while on the Astral 
Plane (or the death of his or her helpless physical body 
on the Material Plane) can result in the character's true 
death. Thus, high-level characters sometimes travel to 
the Outer Planes by way of astral projection rather than 
eek out a portal or use a more direct spell. 
Only a few things can sever a traveler's silver cord, the 
most common being a psychic wind (described below). 
The legendary silver swords of the githyanki also have 
this ability. A character who travels bodily to the Astral 
Plane (by means of the plane shift spell or one of the 
.-are portals that leads directly there) has no silver cord. 
COLOR POOLS 
Gateways leading from the Astral Plane to other 
planes appear as two-dimensional pools of rippling 
colors, ld6 x 10 feet in diameter. Traveling to another 
plane requires locating a color pool that leads to the 
desired plane. These gateways to other planes can be 
:dentified by color, as shown on the Astral Color Pools 
table. Finding the right color pool is a matter of chance: 
.ocating the correct one takes ld4 x 10 hours of travel. AsTRAL CoLoR PooLs

PSYCHIC WIND 
A psychic wind isn't a physical wind like that found on 
the Material Plane, but a storm of thought that batters 
travelers ' minds rather than their bodies. A psychic 
wind is made up of lost memories , forgotten ideas, 
minor musings, and subconscious fears that went 
astray in the Astral Plane and conglomerated into this 
powerful force. 
A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of 
the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes 
as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the 
traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself 
was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes, 
the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal 
in a few rounds. 
The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a 
location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers 
journeying together suffers the same location effect. 
Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a 
DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the 
traveler suffers the mental effect as well. Roll a d20 
twice and consult the Psychic Wind Effects table to 
determine the location and mental effects.

ASTRAL PLANE ENCOUNTERS 
Planar travelers and refugees from other planes wander 
the expanses of the Astral Plane. The most prominent 
denizens of the Astral Plane are the githyanki, an 
outcast race of reavers that sail sleek astral ships, 
slaughter astral travelers, and raid planes touched 
by the AstraL Their city, Tu'narath, floats through the 
Astral Plane on a chunk of rock that is actually the body 
of a dead god. 
Celestials, fiends, and mortal explorers often scour 
the Astral Plane for color pools leading to desired 
destinations. Characters who linger for too long 
in the Astral might have an encounter with one or 
more wandering angels, demons, devils, night hags, 
yugoloths , or other planar travelers. ETHEREAL PLANE 
Tamlinfelt a hand on him, felt his body shimmer into 
mist The screams and shouts sounded far off-The walls 
around him appeared to be only gray shadows. Rival en 
and Brenn us stood beside him. 
"The ethereal plane," Rivalen said. "The dragon's breath 
cannot affect us here." 
-PaulS. Kemp, Shadowstor m 
The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension . 
Its "shores," called the Border Ethereal , overlap the 
Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every 
location on those planes has a corresponding location 
on the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the Border Ethereal 
is limited to 60 feet The plane's depths comprise a 
region of swirling mist and fog called the Deep EthereaL 
where visibility is limited to 30 feet 
Characte rs can use the etherealness spell to enter 
the Border EthereaL The plane shift spell allows 
transport to the Border Ethereal or the Deep Ethereal, 
but unless the intended destination is a specific location 
or a teleportation circle, the point of arrival could be 
anywhere on the plane. 
BORDER ETHEREAL ------
From the Border Ethereal , a traveler can see into 
whatever plane it overlaps , but that plane appears muted 
and indistinct , its colors blurring into each other and 
its edges turning fuzzy. Ethereal denizens watch the 
plane as though peering through distorted and frosted 
glass, and can't see anything beyond 30 feet into the 
other plane. Conversely, the Ethereal Plane is usually 
invisible to those on the overlapped planes, except with 
the aid of magic. 
-Normally, creatures in the Border Ethereal can't 
attack creatures on the overlapped plane, and vice 
versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible and 
utterly silent to someone on the overlapped plane, and 
solid objects on the overlapped plane don't hamper 
the movement of a creature in the Border EthereaL 
The exceptions are certain magical effects (including 
anything made of magical force) and living beings. This 
makes the Ethereal Plane ideal for reconnaissanc e, 
spying on opponents, and moving around without being 
detected. The Ethereal Plane also disobeys the laws 
of gravity; a creature there can move up and down as 
easily as walking. 
DEEP ETHEREAL -------
To reach the Deep Ethereal , one needs a plane shift 
spell or arrive by means of a gate spell or magical portaL 
Visitors to the Deep Ethereal are engulfed by roiling 
mist Scattered throughout the plane are curtains of 
vaporous color, and passing through a curtain leads a 
traveler to a region of the Border Ethereal connected to 
a specific Inner Plane, the Material Plane, the Feywild. 
or the ShadowfelL The color of the curtain indicates the 
plane whose Border Ethereal the curtain conceals; see 
the Ethereal Curtains table.

Traveling through the Deep Ethereal to journey from 
one plane to another is unlike physical travel. Distance 
is meaningless , so although travelers feel as if they can 
move by a simple act of will, it's impossible to measure 
speed and hard to track the passage of time. A trip 
between planes through the Deep Ethereal takes 1d10 
x 10 hours, regardless of the origin and destination. In 
combat, however, creatures are considered to move at 
their normal speeds. 
ETHER CYCLONES 
An ether cyclone is a serpentine column that spins 
through the plane. The cyclone appears abruptly, 
distorting and uprooting ethereal forms in its path and 
carrying the debris for leagues. Travelers with a passive 
Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or more receive 1d4 
rounds of warning: a deep hum in the ethereal matter. 
Travelers who can't reach a curtain or portal leading 
elsewhere suffer the cyclone's effect. Roll a d20 and 
consult the Ether Cyclone table to determine the effect 
on all creatures in the vicinity.

d20 Effect 
1-12 Extended journey 
13-19 Blown to the Border Ethereal of a random plane 
(roll on the Ethereal Curtains table) 
20 Hurled into the Astral Plane 
The most common effect of an ether cyclone is to 
extend the duration of a journey. Each character in a 
group traveling together must make a DC 15 Charisma 
aving throw. If at least half the group succeeds, travel 
is delayed by 1d10 hours. Otherwise, the journey's travel 
time is doubled. Less often, a group is blown into the 
Border Ethereal of a random plane. Rarely, the cyclone 
rears a hole in the fabric of the plane and hurls the party 
into the Astral Plane. 
ETHEREAL PLANE ENCOUNTERS 
_lost encounters in the Border Ethereal are with 
eatures on the Material Plane whose senses or 
abilities extend into the Ethereal Plane (phase spiders, 
:or example). Ghosts also move freely between the 
:=:rhereal and Material Planes. 
In the Deep Ethereal , most encounters are with other 
~ve lers , particularly ones from the Inner Planes (such 
...: elementals, genies, and salamanders) , as well as the 
-casional celestial, fiend, or fey. FEYWILD 
Stepping into the portal was like settling into a warm bath, 
though the chill didn't jade from the air. At first everything 
muted-the roar of the river around the rocks below, the 
chirping of frogs and crickets on shore, the evening bustle of 
the town behind him .... A moment later, the world erupted 
into vibrant life. Frogs and night birds sang a chorus; the air 
was awash with autumn scents; the moonlight painted the 
flowers in iridescent blue, silver, and violet; and the rushing 
of the river became a complex symphony . 
-James Wyatt, Oath of Vigilance 
The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of 
soft lights and wonder, a place of music and death. It is a 
realm of everlasting twilight, with glittering faerie lights 
bobbing in the gentle breeze and fat fireflies buzzing 
through groves and fields. The sky is alight with the 
faded colors of an ever-setting sun, which never truly 
sets (or rises for that matter); it remains stationary , 
dusky and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas 
ruled by the seelie fey that compose the Summer Court, 
the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed brambles and 
syrupy fens-perfect territory for the unseelie fey to hunt 
their prey. 
The Feywild exists in parallel to the Material 
Plane, an alternate dimension that occupies the same 
cosmological space. The landscape of the Feywild 
mirrors the natural world but turns its features into 
spectacular forms. Where a volcano stands on the 
Material Plane, a mountain topped with skyscraper­
sized crystals that glow with internal fire towers in the 
Feywild. A wide and muddy river on the Material Plane 
might be echoed as a clear and winding brook of great 
beauty. A marsh could be reflected as a vast black bog of 
sinister character. And moving to the Feywild from old 
ruins on the Material Plane might put a traveler at the 
door of an arch fey's castle. 
The Feywild is inhabited by sylvan creatures, such 
as elves, dryads, satyrs, pixies, and sprites, as well as 
centaurs and magical creatures such as blink dogs, 
faerie dragons, treants, and unicorns. The darker 
regions of the plane are home to such malevolent 
creatures as hags, blights, goblins, ogres, and giants. 
SEELIE AND UNSEELIE FEY 
Two queens hold court in the Feywild, and most fey owe 
allegiance to one or the other. Queen Titania and her 
Summer Court lead the seelie fey, and the Queen of Air and 
Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court, leads the unseelie fey. 
Seelie and unseelie do not directly correlate with good and 
evil, though many mortals make that equation. Many seelie 
fey are good, and many unseelie are evil, but their opposition 
to each other stems from their queens' jealous rivalry, not 
abstract moral concerns. Ugly denizens of the Feywild, such 
as fomorians and hags, are almost never members of either 
court, and fey of independent spirit reject the courts entirely. 
The courts have warred at times, but they also compete in 
more-or-less friendly contests and even ally with one another 
in small and secret ways. 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE 49 
so FEY CROSSINGS 
Fey crossings are places of mystery and beauty on the 
Material Plane that have a near-perfect mirror in the 
Feywild, creating a portal where the two planes touch. 
A traveler passes through a fey crossing by entering a 
clearing, wading into a pool, stepping into a circle of 
mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. To 
the traveler, it seems like he or she has simply walked 
into the Feywild with a step. To an observer, the traveler 
is there one moment and gone the next. 
Like other portals between planes, most fey crossings 
open infrequently . A crossing might open only during 
a full moon, on the dawn of a particular day, or for 
someone carrying a certain type of item. A fey crossing 
can be closed permanently if the land on either side is 
dramatically altered-for example, if a castle is built 
over the clearing on the Material Plane. 
OPTIONAL RULES: FEYWILD MAGIC 
Tales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures 
and spirited away to the Feywild, only to return to their 
parents years later without having aged a day, and 
with no memories of their captors or the realm they 
came from. Likewise , adventurers who return from an 
excursion to the Feywild are often alarmed to discover 
upon their return that time flows differently on the 
Plane of Faerie, and that the memories of their visit 
are hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the 
strange magic that suffuses the plane. 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTTVERSE MEMORY LOSS 
A creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC 
10 Wisdom saving throw. Fey creatures automatically 
succeed on the saving throw, as do any creatures, like 
elves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature that 
fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its 
time spent in the Feywild. On a successful save, the 
creature's memories remain intact but are a little hazy. 
Any spell that can end a curse can restore the creature's 
lost memories. 
TIME WARP 
While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, 
characters might spend a day there and realize, upon 
leaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed 
everywhere else in the multiverse . 
Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves 
the Feywild after spending at least 1 day on that plane, 
you can choose a time change that works best for your 
campaign , if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp 
table. A wish spell can be used to remove the effect on 
up to ten creatures. Some powerful fey have the ability 
to grant such wishes and might do so if the beneficiaries 
agree to subject themselves to a geas spell and complete 
a quest after the wish spell is cast.

~he foothills and plains near it, so numerous their glowing 
~res looked like swarms of fireflies. He felt the darkness in 
everything he could see.jelt it as an extension of himself, 
and the feeling made him too big by half. 
-PaulS. Kemp, The Godborn 
he Shadowfell , also called the Plane of Shadow, is a 
dimension of black, gray, and white where most other 
color has been leached from everything. It is a place of 
darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black 
ault with neither sun nor stars. 
The Shadowfell overlaps the Material Plane in much 
r.be same way as the Feywild. Aside from the colorless 
landscape, it appears similar to the Material Plane. 
Landmarks from the Material Plane are recognizable 
on the Shadowfell, but they are twisted and warped­
distorted reflections of what exists on the Material Plane. Where a mountain stands on the Material Plane, 
the corresponding feature on the Shadowfell is a jagged 
rock outcropping with a resemblance to a skull, a heap 
of rubble, or perhaps the crumbling ruin of a once-great 
castle. A forest on the Shadowfell is dark and twisted, 
its branches reaching out to snare travelers ' cloaks, and 
its roots coiling and buckling to trip those who pass by. 
Shadow dragons and undead creatures haunt this 
bleak plane, as do other creatures that thrive in the 
gloom, including cloakers and darkmantles. 
SHADOW CROSSINGS 
Similar to fey crossings , shadow crossings are locations 
where the veil between the Material Plane and the 
Shadowfell is so thin that creatures can walk from one 
plane to the other. A blot of shadow in the corner of a 
dusty crypt might be a shadow crossing, as might an 
open grave. Shadow crossings form in gloomy places 
where spirits or the stench of death lingers, such as 
battlefields, graveyards , and tombs. They manifest only 
in darkness, closing as soon as they feel light's kiss. 
DOMAINS OF DREAD 
In remote corners of the Shadowfell, it is easy to reach 
horrific demiplanes ruled over by accursed beings of 
terrible evil. The best known of these is the valley of 
Barovia, overlooked by the towering spires of Castle 
Ravenloft and ruled by Count Strahd von Zarovich, 
the first vampire. Beings of the Shadowfell called the 
Dark Powers created these domains as prisons for 
these "darklords ," and through cruelty or carelessness 
trapped innocent mortals in these domains as well. 
OPTIONAL RULE: 
SHADOWFELL DESPAIR 
A melancholic atmosphere pervades the Shadowfell. 
Extended forays to this plane can afflict characters with 
despair, as reflected in this optional rule. 
When you deem it appropriate , though usually not 
more than once per day, you can require a character 
not native to the Shadowfell to make a DC 10 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failure, the character is affected by 
despair. Roll a d6 to determine the effects, using the 
Shadowfell Despair table. You can substitute different 
despair effects of your own creation. 
SHADOWFELL DESPAIR 
d6 Effect 
l-3 Apathy. The character has disadvantage on 
death saving throws and on Dexterity checks for 
initiative, and gains the following flaw: "I don't 
believe I can make a difference to anyone or 
anything." 
4-5 Dread. The character has disadvantage on all 
saving throws and gains the following flaw: "I am 
convinced that this place is going to kill me." 
6 Madness. The character has disadvantage 
on ability checks and saving throws that use 
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, and gains the 
following flaw: "I can't tell what's real anymore." 
If a character is already suffering a despair effect and 
fails the saving throw, the new despair effect replaces 
the old one. After finishing a long rest, a character 
can attempt to overcome the despair with a DC 15 
Wisdom saving throw. (The DC is higher because it's 
harder to shake off despair once it has taken hold.) 
On a successful save, the despair effect ends for that 
character. 
A calm emotions spell removes despair, as does any 
spell or other magical effect that removes a curse. 
EVER NIGHT 
The city of Neverwinter in the world of the Forgotten Realms 
has a dark reflection on the Shadowfell: the city of Evernight. 
Evernight is a city of cracked stone edifices and homes of 
rotten wood. Its roads are made mostly of trampled grave 
dust, and its few cobbled streets are missing enough stones 
that they appear pockmarked. The sky is corpse gray, and the 
breeze blows cold and humid, bringing a chill to the skin. 
The city's living residents include mad necromancers , 
corrupt purveyors of human flesh, worshipers of evil deities, 
and others who are able to make themselves useful and crazy 
enough to want to live here. But the living are a minority 
in Evernight, for the bulk of the population consists of the 
shambling dead. Zombies, wights, vampires , and other 
undead make the city their home, all under the watchful eyes 
of the ruling caste: intelligent, flesh-eating ghouls. 
Rumors abound that this foul place mirrors one city on 
every world.

CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE jill' INNER PLANES 
He was lying on his back upon baked and smoldering stone. 
staring up at a smoky gray sky lit from distant and unseen 
fires. Around him, a sea of lava burped gouts of gas and jets 
of flame. The Elemental Plane of Fire. 
Thank the fell ones, Vhok thought. I never thought I'd be 
so happy to be here. 
-Thomas M. Reid, The Gossamer Plain 
The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material 
Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental 
substance from which all worlds were made. The four 
Elemental Planes-Air, Earth, Fire, and Water-form 
a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within 
a churning realm known as the Elemental Chaos. 
These planes are all connected, and the border regions 
between them are sometimes described as distinct 
planes in their own right. 
At their innermost edges, where they are closest 
to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal 
geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes 
resemble places in the Material Plane. The four 
elements mingle together as they do in the Material 
Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. But the dominant 
element exerts a strong influence on the environment , 
reflecting its fundamental qualities. 
The inhabitants of this inner ring include aarakocra , 
azers, dragon turtles, gargoyles , genies, mephits, 
salamanders , and xorn. Some originated on the 
Material Plane, and all can travel to the Material 
Plane (if they have access to the magic required) and 
survive there. 
As. they extend farther from the Material Plane, 
the Elemental Planes become increasingly alien and 
hostile. Here, in the outermost regions, the elements 
exist in their purest form: great expanses of solid earth, 
blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. Any 
foreig-n substance is extremely rare; little air can be 
found in the outermost reaches of the Plane of Earth, 
and earth is all but impossible to find in the outermost 
reaches of the Plane of Fire. These areas are much less 
hospitable to travelers from the Material Plane than 
the border regions are. Such regions are little known, 
so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a 
speaker usually means the border region. 
The outermost regions are largely the domains of 
elemental spirits barely recognizable as creatures. 
The creatures usually called elementals dwell here, 
including the Elemental Princes of Evil (primordial 
beings of pure elemental fury) and elemental spirits 
that spellcasters can bind into galeb duhrs, golems, 
invisible stalkers, magmin, and water weirds. These 
elemental creatures don't need food or other sustenanc e 
on their home planes, because they are sustained by the 
elemental energies that saturate those planes. 
ELEMENTAL CHAOS ----
At the farthest extents of the Elemental Planes, the pure 
elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending 
wt of clashing energies and colliding substance 
ed the Elemental Chaos. Elementals can be found 
-a well, but they usually don't stay long, preferring 
~ .:omfort of their native planes. Reports indicate 
~xis tence of weird hybrid elementals native to the 
ental Chaos, but such creatures are seldom seen 
• er planes. 
~A entia! nature of air is movement , animation, and

At the other end of the plane. near the Frostfell (the 
plane of ice that borders the Plane of Water), is a region 
of frigid winds called the Mistral Reach. These gales 
drive snowstorms into the Frostfell and away from it, 
.toward the heart of the plane. Earth motes in the reach 
are covered with snow and ice. 
PLANE OF EARTH 
I Earth symbolizes stability, rigidity, stern resolve, and 
tradition. The plane's position opposite the Plane of 
Air in the ring of the Elemental Planes reflects its 
opposition to almost everything air represents. 
The Plane of Earth is a chain of mountains rising 
higher than any mountain range in the Material Plane. 
It has no sun of its own, and no air surrounds the peaks 
of its highest mountains. Most visitors to the plane 
arrive by way of caves and caverns that honeycomb the 
mountains. 
The largest cavern beneath the mountains, called 
the Great Dismal Delve or the Sevenfold Mazework, is 
home to the capital city of the dao, the City of jewels. 
The dao take great pride in their wealth and send teams 
of slaves across the plane in search of new veins of 
ore and gemstones to exploit. Thanks to their efforts, 
every building and significant object in the city is made 
from precious stones and metals, including the slender 
gemstone-inlaid spires that top most buildings. The city 
is protected by a powerful spell that alerts the entire dao 
population if a visitor steals even a single stone. Theft is 
punishable by death, with punishment extending to the 
thief's relatives . 
The mountains nearest the Fountains of Creation (on 
the Plane of Fire) are called the Furnaces. Lava seeps 
through their caverns, and the air reeks of sulfur. The 
dao have great forges and smelting furnaces here to 
process their ores and shape their precious metals. 
The border region between the planes of Water and 
Earth is a horrid swamp where twisted, gnarled trees 
and thick, stinging vines grow from the dense muck and 
slime. Here and there within the Swamp of Oblivion 
(also called the Plane of Ooze), stagnant lakes and pools 
play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous swarms of 
mosquitoes. The few settlements here consist of wooden 
structures suspended above the muck. Most are built on 
platforms between trees, but a few stand on stilts driven 
deep into the muck. No solid earth underlies the mud 
of the swamp, so houses built on poles eventually sink 
down into it. 
It is said that any object cast into the Swamp of 
Oblivion can't be found again for at least a century. Now 
and then, a desperate soul casts an artifact of power into 
this place, removing it from the multiverse for a time. 
The promise of powerful magic lures adventurers to 
brave the monstrous insects and hags of the swamp in 
search of these treasures. 
The region of the plane nearest the Swamp of 
Oblivion is called the Mud Hills. Landslides constantly 
wear away the slopes of the hills, sending cascades 
of earth and stone into the bottomless swamp. The 
Plane of Earth seems to constantly regenerate the land, 
pushing new hills up as the old ones erode to nothing. 
PLANE OF FIRE 
Fire represents vibrancy, passion, and change. At 
its worst, it is cruel and wantonly destructive, as the 
efreet often are, but at its best, fire reflects the light of 
inspiration, the warmth of compassion, and the flame 
of desire. 
A blazing sun hangs at the zenith of a golden sky 
above the Plane of Fire, waxing and waning on a 
1-l-hour cycle. It ranges from white hot at noon to deep 
::-ed at midnight , so the darkest hours of the plane 
display a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is nearly 
lin ding. Most business in the City of Brass (see below) 
takes place during the darker hours. 
The weather on the plane is marked by fierce winds 
and thick ash. Although the air is breathable , creatures 
ot native to the plane must cover their mouths and 
eyes to avoid stinging cinders. The efreet use magic to 
·eep the cinder storms away from the City of Brass, 
-ut elsewhere in the plane, the wind is always at least 
· lustery and rises to hurricane force during the 
orst storms. 
The heat in the Plane of Fire is comparable to 
a hot desert on the Material Plane, and poses a 
::imilar threat to travelers (see "Extreme Heat" in 
hapter 5, "Adventure Environm ents"). The deeper 
one goes into the plane, the rarer water becomes. 
3eyond a point, the plane holds no sources of water, 
-travelers must carry their own supplies or produce 
ater by magic. 
The Plane of Fire is dominated by the vast Cinder 
astes, a great expanse of black cinders and embers 
ossed by rivers of lava. Roving bands of salamanders 
bartle each other, raid azer outposts, and avoid the 
~ reet. Ancient ruins dot the desert-remnants of 
:"orgotten civilizations. 
A great range of volcanic mountains called the 
Fountains of Creation is home to azers. These rocky 
;>eaks curl from the edge of the Plane of Earth around 
-e Cinder Wastes toward the fiery heart of the plane. 
the edge of the plane, the mountains are also called 
e Plane of Magma. Fire giants and red dragons 
:nake their homes here, as well as creatures from the 
eighboring planes. 
Lava flows through the volcanoes toward the Plane 
fAir and pools into a great lava sea, called the Sea 
of Fire, sailed by efreet and azers in great brass ships. 
-lands of obsidian and basalt jut up from the sea, 
otted with ancient ruins and the lairs of powerful 
::-ed dragons. On the shore of the Sea of Fire stands 
the City of Brass. 
THE CITY OF BRASS 
Perhaps the best-known location in the Inner Planes is 
the City of Brass, on the shores of the Sea of Fire. This 
i the fabled city of the efreet, and its ornate spires and 
metal walls reflect their grandiose and cruel nature. 
True to the nature of the Plane of Fire, everything in , 
the city seems alive with dancing flames, reflecting the 
.;brant energy of the place. 
Adventurers frequently come here on quests for 
.egendary magic. If it's possible to buy magic items at 
all. the City of Brass is the most likely place to find any 
item for sale, though the price might wei! be more than 
gold. The efreet are fond of trading in favors, especiall y 
when they have the upper hand in negotiations. Perhap 
a magical disease or poison can be cured only with 
something that must be purchased in the bazaars 
of the city. 
The heart of the city is the towering Charcoal 
Palace, where the tyrannical sultan of the efreet reigns 
supreme, surrounded by efreet nobles and a host of 
slaves, guardians, and sycophants. 
PLANE OF WATER 
The nature of water is to flow, not like the gusting wind 
or the leaping flame, but smoothly and steadily. It is the 
rhythm of the tide, the nectar of life, the bitter tears of 
mourning , and the balm of sympathy and healing. Given 
time, it can erode all in its path. 
A warm sun arcs across the sky of the Plane of 
Water, seeming to rise and set from within the water 
at the visible edge of the horizon. Several times a day, 
however, the sky clouds over and releases a deluge 
of rain, often accompanied by spectacular shows of 
lightning, before clearing up again. At night, a glittering 
array of stars and auroras bedecks the sky. 
The Plane of Water is an endless sea, called the Sea 
of Worlds, dotted here and there with atolls and islands 
that rise up from enormous coral reefs that seem to 
stretch forever into the depths. The storms that move 
across the sea sometimes create temporary portals 
to the Material Plane and draw ships into the Plane 
of Water. Surviving vessels from countless worlds 
and navies ply these waters with little hope of ever 
returning home. 
The weather on the plane is a lesson in extremes. 
If the sea isn't calm, it is battered by storms. On rare 
oc.casions, a tremor in the planar firmament sends a 
rogue wave sweeping across the plane, swamping entire 
islands and driving ships down to the reefs. 
Life flourishes in the upper reaches of the Sea of 
Worlds, called the Sea of Light because of the sunlight 
filtering down into the water. Aquatic humanoids craft 
castles and fortresses in the coral reefs. The marids 
are the distant stewards of this region, content to allow 
the lesser folk to compete for territory. The nominal 
emperor of the marids dwells in the Citadel ofTen 
Thousand Pearls, an opulent palace made of coral and 
studded with pearls. 
The deeper extents of the plane, where no sunlight 
reaches, are called the Darkened Depths. Horrid 
creatures dwell here, and the absolute cold and crushing 
pressure mean a swift end to creatures accustomed 
to the surface or the Sea of Light. Krakens and other 
mighty leviathans claim this realm. 
Any land that rises above the surface of the sea is 
hotly contested by the few air-breathers that live on the 
plane. Fleets of rafts and ships lashed together serve 
as solid ground where nothing else is available. Most 
natives of the plane never break the surface of the sea 
and thus ignore these habitations. 
One of the few actual islands on the plane is the Isle 
of Dread. The island is connected to the Material Plane 
by means of a regular storm that sweeps over the island.

Flats. The water is thick with soil and sludge, and turns 
.mo muddy ground before giving way to the great swamp 
between the planes. 
At the other extreme of the plane is the Sea oflce, 
bordering the Frostfell. The frigid water is choked with 
cebergs and sheet ice, inhabited by the cold-loving 
creatures that inhabit the Frostfell. Drifting icebergs 
can carry these creatures farther into the Plane of 
'Yater to threaten ships and islands in warmer seas. 
The Frostfell, also called the Plane of Ice, forms the 
border between the planes of Air and Water and is a 
seemingly endless glacier swept by constant, raging 
blizzards. Frozen caverns twist through the Plane of 
Ice, home to yetis, remorhazes, white dragons, and other 
creatures of cold. The inhabitants of the plane engage in 
a never-ending battle to prove their strength and ensure 
their survival. 
Its dangerous monsters and bitter cold make the 
Frostfell a dangerous place to travel. Most planar 
·:oyagers keep to the air, braving the powerful winds and 
driving snow to avoid setting foot on the great glacier. ·cinder

OUTER PLANES 
Streamers of noxious gas streaked that crimson dome like 
dirty clouds. They whirled to form what looked like giant 
eyes staring down, eyes that were swept away before they 
couldfocus , only to form anew, again and again. Beneath 
the ruby glow lay a dark nightmare land of bare rock and 
flumes of sparks and goutingjlame , where things slithered 
and scrambled half-seen in the shadows. Mountains clawed 
the ruby sky. The Land of Teeth, Azuth had once aptly 
called it, surveying the endless jagged rocks. This was the 
Greeting Ground, the realm of horror that had claimed 
the lives of countless mortals. He was whirling along above 
Avernus, uppermost of the Nine Hells. 
-Ed Greenwood , Elminster in Hell 
If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that 
makes up the multiverse , the Outer Planes provide the 
direction , thought, and purpose for its construction. 
Accordingly , many sages refer to the Outer Planes as 
divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the 
Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities. 
When discussing anything to do with deities, the 
language used must be highly metaphorical. Their 
CHAPTER 2 J CREATING A MULTlVERSE 57 
actual homes aren't literally places at all, but exemplify 
the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and 
spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine 
the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a border 
region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond 
ordinary sensory experience. 
Even in perceptible regions, appearances can be 
deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear 
hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. 
But the landscape can change at a whim of the powerful 
forces that dwell on these planes, which can remake 
them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding 
existence to better fulfill their divine needs. 
Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the 
Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes can 
seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what 
seems like infinity. Adventurers could take a guided 
tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, 
in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it 
could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek 
across a single layer. 
The default Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes 
that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding 
neutrality , which is represented by the Outlands, 
described in the section on "Other Planes") and the 
shades of distinction between them.

The planes with an element of good in their nature are 
called the Upper Planes, while those with an element 
of evil are the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is 
its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't 
match the plane's alignment experiences a sense of 
dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, 
for example, it feels in tune with the plane, but an 
evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little 
uncomfortable. 
The Upper Planes are the home of celestial creatures, 
including angels, couatls, and pegasi. The Lower Planes 
are the home of fiends: demons, devils, yugoloths, 
and their ilk. The planes in between host their own 
unique denizens: the construct race of modrons 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTT\'ERSE inhabit Mechanus, and the aberrations called slaadi 
thrive in Limbo. 
LAYERS OF THE OUTER PLANES 
Most of the Outer Planes include a number of distinct 
environments or realms. These realms are often 
imagined and depicted as a stack of related parts of the 
same plane, so travelers refer to them as layers. For 
example, Mount Celestia resembles a seven-tiered layer 
cake, the Nine Hells has nine layers, and the Abyss has 
a seemingly endless number of layers. 
Most portals from elsewhere reach the first layer of a 
multilayered plane. This layer is variously depicted as 
the top or bottom layer, depending on the plane. As the 
arrival point for most visitors, the first layer functions 
like a city gate for that plane. 
TRAVELING THE OUTER PLANES 
Traveling between the Outer Planes isn't dissimilar 
from reaching the Outer Planes in the first place. 
Characters traveling by means of the astral projection 
spell can go from one plane into the Astral Plane, and 
there search out a color pool leading to the desired 
destination. Characters can also use plane shift to reach 
a different plane more directly. Most often, though, 
characters use portals-either a portal that links the two 
planes directly or a portal leading to Sigil, City of Door . 
which holds portals to all the planes. 
Two planar features connect multiple Outer Planes 
together: the River Styx and the Infinite Staircase. 
Other planar crossings might exist in your campaign , 
such as a World Tree whose roots touch the Lower 
Planes and whose branches reach to the Upper Planes. 
or it might be possible to walk from one plane to another 
in your cosmology. 
THE RIVER STYX 
This river bubbles with grease, foul flotsam, and 
the putrid remains of battles along its banks. Any 
creature other than a fiend that tastes or touches the 
water ·is affected by a feeblemind spell. The DC of the 
Intelligence saving throw to resist the effect is 15. 
The Styx churns through the top layers of Acheron, 
the Nine Hells, Gehenna , Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and 
Pandemonium. Tributaries of the Styx snake onto lower 
layers of these planes. For example, a tendril of the Styx 
winds through every layer of the Nine Hells, allowing 
passage from one layer of that plane to the next. 
Sinister ferries float on the waters of the Styx, crewed 
by pilots skilled in negotiating the unpredictable 
currents and eddies of the river. For a price, these pilots 
are willing to carry passengers from plane to plane. 
Some of them are fiends, while others are the souls of 
dead creatures from the Material Plane. 
THE INFINITE STAIRCASE 
The Infinite Staircase is an extradimensional spiral 
staircase that connects the planes. An entrance to the 
Infinite Staircase usually appears as a nondescript 
door. Beyond the portal lies a small landing with an 
equally nondescript stairway leading up and down. The 
Infinite Staircase changes appearance as it climbs and

The single sacred mountain of Mount Celestia rises 
from a shining Silver Sea to heights barely visible and 
utterly incomprehensible , with seven plateaus marking 
its seven heavenly layers. The plane is the model of 
justice and order, of celestial grace and endless mercy, 
where angels and champions of good guard against 
incursions of evil. It is one of the few places on the 
planes where travelers can let down their guard. Its 
inhabitants strive constantly to be as righteous as 
possible. Countless creatures aim to reach the highest 
and most sublime peak of the mountain, but only the 
purest souls can. Gazing toward that peak fills even the 
most jaded of travelers with awe. 
OPTIONAL RULE: BLESSED BENEFICENCE 
In contrast to the dissonance experienced by evil 
creatures here, good creatures are literally blessed by 
the pervasive beneficence of the plane. Creatures of 
good alignment gain the benefit of the bless spell as long 
as they remain on the plane. In addition, finishing a long 
rest on the plane grants a good creature the benefit of a 
lesser restoration spell. 
BYTOPIA 
The two layers of the Twin Paradises of Bytopia are 
similar yet opposite: one is a tamed, pastoral landscape 
and the other an untamed wilderness, yet both reflect 
the plane's goodness and its acceptance of law and 
order when necessary. Bytopia is the heaven of 
productive work, the satisfaction of a job well done. The 
goodness flowing through the plane creates feelings of 
goodwill and happiness in creatures dwelling there. 
OPTIONAL RULE: PERVASIVE GOODWILL 
At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a 
visitor that is neither lawful good nor neutral good 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE 59 
6o must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed 
save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful good 
or neutral good (whichever is closer to the creature's 
current alignment). The change becomes permanent 
if the creature doesn't leave the plane within ld4 days. 
Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts to normal 
after one day spent on a plane other than Bytopia. 
Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the creature 
also restores its original alignment. 
ELYSIUM 
Elysium is home to creatures of unfettered kindness and 
compassion, and a welcome refuge for planar travelers 
seeking a safe haven. The plane's bucolic landscapes 
glimmer with life and beauty in their prime. Tranquility 
seeps into the bones and souls of those who enter the 
plane. It is the heaven of well-earned rest, a place where 
tears of joy glisten on many a cheek. 
OPTIONAL RuLE: OvERWHELMING joY 
Visitors spending any time on this plane risk becoming 
trapped by overwhelming sensations of contentment 
and happiness. At the end of each long rest taken on 
this plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature is unwilling to leave 
the plane before taking another long rest. After three 
failed saving throws, the creature never willingly leaves 
the plane and, if forcibly removed, does everything in its 
power to return to the plane. A dispel evil and good spell 
removes this effect from the creature. 
THE BEASTLANDS 
The Beastlands is a plane of nature unbound, of forests 
ranging from moss-hung mangroves to snow-laden 
pines, of thick jungles where the branches are woven so 
tight that no light penetrates, of vast plains where grains 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE and wildflowers wave in the wind with vibrant life. The 
plane embodies nature's wildness and beauty, but it also 
speaks to the animal within all living things. 
OPTIONAL RULE: HUNTER'S PARADISE 
Visitors to the Beastlands find their hunting and 
stalking capabilities improved, and characters have 
advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling), Wisdom 
(Perception), and Wisdom (Survival) checks while there. 
OPTIONAL RULE: BEAST TRANSFORMATION 
Whenever a visitor slays a beast native to the plane, the 
slayer must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw 
or become transformed (as the polymorph spell) into the 
type of beast that was slain. In this form, the creature 
retains its intelligence and ability to speak. At the end of 
each long rest, the polymorphed creature can repeat the 
saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature 
returns to its true form. After three failed saving throws. 
the transformation can be undone only by a remove 
curse spell or similar magic. 
ARBOREA 
Larger than life, Arborea is a place of violent moods 
and deep affections, of whim backed by steel, and of 
passions that blaze brightly until they burn out. Its 
good-natured inhabitants are dedicated to fighting evil, 
but their reckless emotions sometimes break free with 
devastating consequences. Rage is as common and as 
honored as joy in Arborea. There the mountains and 
forests are extravagantly massive and beautiful, and 
every glade and stream is inhabited by nature spirits 
that brook no infringement. Travelers must tread lightly. 
Arborea is home to many elves and elven deities. Elve 
born on this plane have the celestial type and are wild at 
heart, ready to battle evil in a heartbeat. Otherwise, they 
look and behave like normal elves. 
OPTIONAL RULE: INTENS E YEARN ING 
-eep track of how many days a visitor spends on 
borea. When the visitor leaves, it must make a 
arisma saving throw against a DC of 5, plus 1 for 
ach day spent on the plane. On a failed save, the 
:;eature becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to 
-;borea. As long as the effect persists, the creature has 
~dvantage on ability checks. At the end of each long 
~-r. the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending 
e effect on a success. A dispel evil and good spell 
-~mov es this effect from the creature. 
GARD 
:gard is a rugged realm of soaring mountains, deep 
-d . and windswept battlefields, with summers that 
-e long and hot, and winters that are wickedly cold 
-unforgiving. Its continents float above oceans of 
anic rock, below which are icy caverns so enormous 
... o hold entire kingdoms of giants, humans, dwarves, 
_-mes, and other beings. Heroes come to Ysgard to 
.:-their mettle not only against the plane itself, but also 
:ainst giants, dragons, and other terrible creatures that 
-:..:nder across Ysgard's vast terrain. 
?TIONAL RULE: IMMORTAL WRATH 
~,ard is the home of slain heroes who wage eternal 
-e on fields of glory. Any creature, other than a 
~ ruct or undead, that is killed by an attack or a 
--· while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the next 
_. The creature has all its hit points restored, and all 
·[ions and afflictions it suffered before its death 
bo is a plane of pure chaos, a roiling soup of 
rmanent matter and energy. Stone melts into 
. [hat freezes into metal, then turns into diamond that burns up into smoke that becomes snow, and 
on and on in an endless, unpredictable process of 
change. Fragments of more ordinary landscapes -bits 
of forest, meadow, ruined castles, and even burbling 
streams-drift through the disorder. The whole plane is 
a nightmarish riot. 
Limbo has no gravity, so creatures visiting th e plane 
float in place. A creature can move up to its walking 
speed in any direction by merely thinking of the desired 
direction of travel. 
Limbo conforms to the will of the creatures inhabiting 
it. Very disciplined and powerful minds can create 
whole islands of their own invention within the plane, 
sometimes maintaining those places for years. A 
simpleminded creature such as a fish, though, might 
have less than a minute before the pocket of water 
surrounding it freezes, vanishes , or turns to glass. 
The slaadi live here and swim amid this chaos, 
creating nothing, whereas githzerai monks build entire 
monasteries with their minds. 
OPTIONAL RULE: POWER OF THE MIND 
As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an 
Intelligence check to mentally move an object on 
the plane that it can see within 30 feet of it. The DC 
depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for 
Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 
for Huge or larger. On a successful check, the creature 
moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for every point by 
which it beat the DC. 
A creature can also use an action to make an 
Intelligence check to alter a non magical object that isn't 
being worn or carried. The same rules for distance 
apply, and the DC is based on the object's size: DC 
10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and 
DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature 
changes the object into another nonliving form of the 
same size, such as turning a boulder into a ball of fire. 
Finally, a creature can use an action to make an 
Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered 
on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the 
sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; 
each additional 10 feet added to the radius increases the 
DC by 5. On a successful check, the creature prevents 
the area from being altered by the plane for 24 hours, or 
until the creature uses this ability again. 
PANDEMONIUM 
Pandemonium is a plane of madness, a great mass of 
rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is 
cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly 
extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches 
and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only 
by yelling, and even then only to a maximum distance 
of 10 feet. Creatures have disadvantage on any ability 
check that relies on hearing. 
Most of the plane's inhabitants are creatures that were 
banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many 
of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds 
or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die 
down until they sound like distant cries of torment. 
OPTIONAL RULE: MAD WINDS 
A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw 
after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a 
failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. 
A creature that reaches six levels of exhaustion while 
on this plane doesn't die. Instead, the creature gains 
a random form of indefinite madness , as described in 
chapter 8, "Running the Game." Finishing a long rest 
doesn't reduce a creature's exhaustion level unless the 
creature can somehow escape the maddening winds. 
THE ABYSS ----------- --
The Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome , and 
chaotic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into 
ever more appalling forms. 
Each layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific 
environment. Although no two layers are alike, they are 
all harsh and inhospitable. Each layer also reflects the 
en tropic nature of the Abyss. In fact, much of what one 
sees or touches on the plane seems to be in a decaying, 
crumbling , or corroded state. 
OPTIONAL RULE: ABYSSAL CORRUPTION 
A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss 
must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a 
failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the 
Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of 
this corruption. You can substitute different corruption 
effects of your own creation. 
After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can 
make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful 
save, the corruption effect ends. A dispel evil and good 
spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends 
the effect. 
If a corrupted creature doesn't leave the plane within 
ld4 + 2 days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil. 
Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the creature 
restores its original alignment. 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE ABYSSAL CoRRUPTION 
dlO Result 
1-4 Treachery . The character gains the following flaw: 
5-7 
8-9 
10 "I can only achieve my goals by making sure that 
my companions don't achieve theirs." 
Bloodlust. The character gains the following flaw: 
"I enjoy killing for its own sake, and once I start, 
it's hard to stop." 
Mad Ambition. The character gains the following 
flaw: "I am destined to rule the Abyss, and my 
companions are tools to that end." 
Demonic Possession. The character is possessed 
by a demonic entity until freed by dispel evil and 
good or similar magic. Whenever the possessed 
character rolls a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, 
or saving throw, the demon takes control of the 
character and determines the character's behavior . 
At the end of each of the possessed character's 
turns, he or she can make a DC 15 Charisma saving 
throw. On a success, the character regains control 
until he or she rolls another 1. 
IMPORTANT LAYERS 
The layers of the Abyss are defined by the demon lords 
who rule them, as the following examples illustrate. 
More information about the demon lords can be found in 
the Monster Manual. 
The Gaping Maw. Demogorgon's layer in the Abyss 
is a vast wilderness of savagery and madness known 
as the Gaping Maw, where even powerful demons 
go insane with fear. Reflecting Demogorgon's dual 
nature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval 
continent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a 
seemingly endless expanse of ocean and brine fiats. The 
Prince of Demons rules his layer from two serpentine 
towers, which emerge from a turbid sea. Each tower 
is topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires 
constitute the fortress of Abysm, where few creatures 
can venture without descending into madness. 
Thanatos. If Orcus had his way, all planes would 
resemble his dead realm of Thanatos, and all creatures 
would become undead under his control. Under its 
black sky, Thanatos is a land of bleak mountains, barren 
moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. 
Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi 
litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, 
bursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any 
creatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus rules 
Thanatos from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted 
of obsidian and bone. Set within a howling wasteland 
called Oblivion's End, the palace is surrounded by tombs 
and burial sites dug into the sheer slopes of narrow 
valleys, creating a tiered necropolis. 
The Demonweb. Lolth's layer is an immense network 
of thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and 
cocoon-like chambers . Throughout the web, buildings, 
structures, ships, and other objects hang as if caught 
in a spider's snare. The nature of Lolth's web creates 
random portals throughout the plane, drawing such 
objects in from demiplan es and Material Plane worlds 
that figure into the schemes of the Spider Queen. 
Lolth's servants also build dungeons amid the webbing, 
trapping and hunting Lolth's hated enemies within 
crisscrossing corridors of web-mort ared stone. 
Far beneath these dungeons lie the bottomless 
Demonweb Pits where the Spider Queen dwells. There, 
Lolth is surrounded by her handmaidens -yochlol 
demons created to serve her and which outrank 
mightier demons while in the Spider Queen's realm. 
The Endless Maze. Baphomet's layer of the Abyss is 
a never-ending dungeon, the center of which holds the 
Horned King's enormous ziggurat palace. A confusing 
jumble of crooked hallways and myriad chambers, the 
palace is surrounded by a mile-wide moat concealing 
a maddening series of submerged stairs and tunnels 
eading deeper into the fortress. 
The Triple Realm. The Dark Prince Graz'zt rules 
over the realm of Azzagrat , which encompasses three 
ayers of the Abyss. His seat of power is the fantastic 
Argent Palace in the city of Zelatar, whose bustling 
markets and pleasure palaces draw visitors from across 
me multiverse in search of obscure magical lore and 
perverse delights. By Graz'zt's command, the demons 
of Azzagrat present a veneer of civility and courtly 
comity. However , the so-called Triple Realm holds as 
uch danger as any other part of the Abyss, and planar 
i itors can vanish without a trace in its mazelike cities 
and in forests whose trees have serpents for branches . 
Death DeJJs. Yeenoghu rules a layer of ravines known 
Death Dells. Here, creatures must hunt to survive. 
.=:ven the plants, which must bathe their roots in blood, 
-are the unwary. Yeenoghu's servants, helping to sate 
eir master's hunger as he prowls his kingdom seeking 
_ ey, capture creatures from the Material Plane for 
lease in the Gnoll Lord's realm. 
CARCERI 
-:-he model for all other prisons in existence, Carceri 
-a plane of desolation and despair. Its six layers hold 
r bogs, fetid jungles, windswept deserts, jagged 
ountains, frigid oceans, and black ice. All form a 
· erable home for the traitors and backstabbers that 
--e trapped on this prison plane. 
OPTIONAL RULE: PRISON PLANE 
_ -o one can leave Carceri easily. Magical efforts to leave 
· e plane by any spell other than a wish simply fail. 
:>onals and gates that open onto the plane become one­
y only. Secret ways out of the plane exist, but they are 
--dden and well guarded by traps and deadly monsters . 
:-lADES ------------------------------------ e layers of Hades are called the Three Glooms­
aces without joy, hope, or passion. A gray land with 
:~ ashen sky, Hades is the destination of many souls 
-ar are unclaimed by the gods of the Upper Planes or 
· e fiendish rulers of the Lower Planes. These souls 
-come larvae and spend eternity in this place that 
cks a sun, a moon, stars, or seasons. Leaching away 
lor and emotion, this gloom is more than most visitors 
can stand. The "Shadowfell Despair" rule earlier in the 
apter can be used to represent a visitor's despair. OPTIONAL RULE: VILE TRANSFORMATION 
At the end of each long rest taken on the plane, a visitor 
must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed 
save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion, which 
can't be removed while the creature remains in Hades. 
If the creature reaches six levels of exhaustion, it doesn't 
die. Instead, the creature permanently transforms into 
a larva, whereupon all levels of exhaustion afflicting the 
creature are removed. 
A larva is a miserable fiend that retains the facial 
features of its previous form but has the body of a fat 
worm. A larva has only a few faint memories of its 
previous life and the statistics in the larva stat block. 
Hades is crawling with larvae. Night hags, liches, and 
rakshasas harvest them for use in vile rituals. Other 
fiends like to feed on them.

GEHENNA 
Gehenna is the plane of suspicion and greed. It is the 
birthplace of the yugoloths , which dwell here in great 
numbers. A volcanic mountain dominates each of the 
four layers of Gehenna, and lesser volcanic earth bergs 
drift in the air and smash into the greater mountains. 
The rocky slopes of the plane make movement here 
difficult and dangerous. The ground inclines at least 
45 degrees almost everywhere. In places, steep cliffs 
and deep canyons present more challenging obstacles . 
Hazards include volcanic fissures that vent noxious 
fumes or searing flames. 
Gehenna has no room for mercy or compassion. The 
fiends living here are among the greediest and most 
selfish in all the multiverse . 
OPTIONAL RULE: CRUEL HINDRANCE 
The plane's cruel nature makes it difficult for visitors to 
help one another. Whenever a visitor casts a spell with a 
beneficial effect, including a spell that restores hit points 
or removes a condition, the caster must first make a DC 
10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell 
fails, the spell slot is expended , and the action is wasted. 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATTNG A MULTI VERSE 
THE NINE HELLS 
The Nine Hells of Baa tor inflame the imaginations of 
travelers, the greed of treasure seekers, and the battle 
fury of all moral creatures. It is the ultimate plane of 
law and evil and the epitome of premeditated cruelty. 
The devils of the Nine Hells are bound to obey the laws 
of their superiors, but they rebel within their individual 
castes. Most undertake any plot, no matter how foul, 
to advance themselves. At the very top of the hierarchy 
is Asmodeus, who has yet to be bested. If he were to 
be vanquished , the victor would rule the plane in turn. 
Such is the law of the Nine Hells. 
OPTIONAL RULE: PERVASIVE EVIL 
Evil pervades the Nine Hells, and visitors to this plane 
feel its influence. At the end of each long rest taken on 
this plane, a visitor that isn't evil must make a DC 10 
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's 
alignment changes to lawful evil. The change becomes 
permanent if the creature doesn't leave the plane within 
ld4 days. Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts 
to normal after one day spent on a plane other than the 
Nine Hells. Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the 
creature also restores its original alignment. 
THE NINE LAYERS 
The Nine Hells has nine layers. The first eight are 
each ruled by archdevils that answer to Asmodeus, 
the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the 
deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend 
through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The 
most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, 
which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer 
to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can 
withstand the torment and horror of that journey. 
Avernus. No planar portals connect directly to the 
lower layers of the Nine Hells, by Asmodeus's orders. 
As such, the first layer of Avernus is the arrival point 
for visitors to the plane. A vern us is a rocky wasteland 
with rivers of blood and clouds of biting flies. Fiery 
comets occasionally fall from the darkened sky and 
leave fuming impact craters behind. Empty battlefields 
are littered with weapons and bones, showing where the 
legions of the Nine Hells met enemies on their native 
soil and prevailed. 
The archduchess Zariel rules Avernus, supplanting 
her rival, Bel, who has fallen out of Asmodeus's favor 
and is forced to serve as Zariel's advisor. Tiamat, the 
Queen of Evil Dragons, is a prisoner on this layer, 
ruling her own domain but confined to the Nine Hells 
by Asmodeus in accordance with some ancient contract 
(the terms of which are known only to Tiamat and the 
Lords of the Nine). 
Zariel's seat of power is a soaring basalt citadel 
festooned with the partially incinerated corpses of 
guests who failed to earn the archduchess 's favor. Zariel 
appears as an angel whose once-beautiful skin and 
wings have been ruined by fire. Her eyes burn with a 
furious white light that can cause creatures looking 
upon her to burst into flame. 
Dis. Dis, the second layer of the Nine Hells, is a 
labyrinth of canyons wedged between sheer mountains 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE rich with iron ore. Iron roads span and wend through 
the canyons, watched over by the garrisons of iron 
fortresses perched atop jagged pinnacles. 
The second layer takes its name from its current lord. 
Dispater. A manipulator and deceiver, the archduke is 
devilishly handsome , bearing only small horns, a tail, 
and a cloven left hoof to distinguish him from a human. 
His crimson throne stands in the heart of the Iron City 
of Dis, a hideous metropolis that is the largest in the 
Nine Hells. Planar travelers come here to conspire with 
devils and to close deals with night hags, rakshasas , 
incubi, succubi, and other fiends. Dispater collects a 
piece of every deal through special provisions that are 
added to contracts signed on his layer of the Nine Hells. 
Dispater is one of Asmodeus 's most loyal and 
resourceful vassals, and few beings in the multiverse 
can outwit him. He is more obsessed than most devils 
with striking deals with mortals in exchange for their 
souls, and his emissaries work tirelessly to foster evil 
schemes in the Material Plane. 
Minauros. The third layer of the Nine Hells is a 
stench-ridden bog. Acidic rain spills from the layer's 
brown skies, thick layers of scum cover its putrid 
surface, and yawning pits lie in wait beneath the murk to 
engulf careless wanderers. Cyclopean cities of ornately 
carved stone rise up from the bog, including the great 
city of Minauros for which the layer is named. 
The slimy walls of the city rise hundreds of feet into 
the air, protecting the flooded halls of Mammon . The 
Archduke of Minauros resembles a massive serpent 
with the upper torso and head of a hairless, horned 
humanoid. Mammon's greed is legendary , and he is 
one of the few arch devils who will trade favors for gold 
instead of souls. His lair is piled high with treasures 
left behind by those who tried-and failed-to best him 
in a deal. 
Phlegethos. Phlegethos, the fourth layer, is a 
fiery landscape whose seas of molten magma brew 
hurricanes of hot wind, choking smoke, and pyroclastic 
ash. Within the fire-filled caldera of Phlegethos's largest 
volcano rises Abriymoch , a fortress city cast of obsidian 
and dark glass. With rivers of molten lava pouring 
down its outer walls, the city resembles the sculpted 
centerpiec e of a gigantic, hellish fountain. 
Abriymoch is the seat of power for the two archdevils 
who rule Phlegethos in tandem: Archduke Belial and 
Archduchess Fierna, Belial's daughter . Belial is a 
handsom e, powerfully built devil who exudes civility, 
even as his words carry an undercurrent of threat. His 
daughter is a statuesque devil whose beauty encases the 
blackest heart in the ine Hells. The alliance of Belial 
and Fierna is unbreakable, for both are aware that their 
mutual survival hinges on it. 
Stygia. The fifth layer of the Nine Hells is a freezing 
realm of ice within which cold flames burn. A frozen sea 
surrounds the layer. and its gloomy sky crackles with 
lightning. 
Archduke Levistus once betrayed Asmodeus and is 
now encased deep in the ice of Stygia as punishment. 
He rules this layer all the same, communicating 
telepathically with hi followers and servants , both in 
the Nine Hells and on the Material Plane. 
Stygia is also home to its previous ruler, the 
serpentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed 
by Asmodeus to allow the imprison ed Levistus 
to regain his rule. Geryon's fall from grace has 
spurred much debate within the infernal courts. No 
one is certain whether Asmodeus had some secret 
cause to dismiss the archdevil or whether he is testing 
Geryon's allegiance for some greater purpose. 
Malbolge. Malbolge , the sixth layer, has outlasted 
many rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countess 
and the archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell out of favor and 
was struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while 
her predecessor, Moloch, still lingers somewhere on 
the sixth layer as an imp, plotting to regain Asmodeus 's 
favor. Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like the 
sides of an impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the 
layer break off from time to time, creating deadly and 
deafening avalanches of stone. The inhabitants of 
.Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves 
carved into the mountainside . 
Malbolge 's current archduchess is Asmodeus 's 
daughter, Glasya. She resembles a succubus with 
her small horns, leathery wings, and forked tail. She 
inherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from 
her father. The citadel that serves as her domicile on 
the slopes of Malbolge is supported by cracked pillars 
and buttresses that are sturdy yet seem on the verge of 
collapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth lined with 
cells and torture chambers , where Glasya confines and 
torments those who displease her. 
Maladomini. The seventh layer, Maladomini, is ruin­
covered wasteland. Dead cities form a desolate urban 
landscape, and between them lie empty quarries, 
crumbling roads, slag heaps, the hollow shells of 
empty fortresses, and swarms of hungry flies. 
The Archduk e of Maladomini is Baalzebul , 
the Lord of Flies. A bloated fiend with the lower 
body of an enormous slug, Baalzebul 's form was 
inflicted on him by Asmodeus as punishment for 
wavering loyalty. Baalzebul is a miserable and 
degenerate monstrosity who has long conspired to 
usurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries 
a curse that causes any deal made with him to lead to 
calamity. Asmodeus occasionally shows Baalzebul favor 
for reasons no other archduke can fathom, though some 
suspect that the Archduke of Ness us still respects the 
worthiness of this fallen adversary. 
Cania. Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells, is 
an icy hellscape , whose ice storms can tear flesh from 
bone. Cities embedded in the ice provide shelter for 
guests and prisoners of Cania's ruler, the brilliant and 
conniving archdevil Mephistopheles . 
Mephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar, 
where he plots to seize the Throne of Baator and 
conquer the planes. He is Asmodeus 's greatest enemy 
and ally, and the Archduke of Ness us appears to 
trust Mephistopheles's counsel when it is offered. 
Mephistopheles knows he can't depose Asmodeus until 
his adversary makes a grave miscalculation , and so 
both wait to see what circumstances might turn them 
66 against each other. Mephistopheles is also a godfather of 
sorts to Glasya, further complicating the relationship. 
Mephistopheles is a tall, striking devil with impressive 
horns and a cool demeanor. He trades in souls, asvo 
other archdevils , but he rarely gives his time to any 
creatures not worthy of his person~! ~ttention .. His 
instincts are as razor sharp as Camas fngtd wmds, 
and it is said that only Asmodeus has ever d~vea or 
thwarted him. / 
Nessus. The lowest layer of the Nine"'Hells, Ness us is 
a realm of dark pits whose walls are set with fortresses. 
There, pit fiend generals loyal to Asmodeus garrison 
their diabolical legions and p)ot the conquest of the 
multiverse. At the center oUhe layer stands a vast 
rift of unknown depth, out of which rises the great 
citadel-spire of Malsheem, home to Asmodeus and his 
infernal court. 
Malsheem resembles a gigantic hollowed-out 
stalagmite. The citadel is also a prison for souls that 
Asmodeus has locked away for safekeeping. Convincing 
him to release even one of those souls comes at a steep 
price, and it is rumored that the Archduke of Nessus has 
claimed whole kingdoms in the past for such favors. 
Asmodeus most often appears as a handsome, 
bearded humanoid with small horns protruding from 
his forehead, piercing red eyes, and flowing robes. 
He can also assume other forms and is seldom seen 
without his ruby-tipped scepter in hand. Asmodeus is 
the most cunning and well-mannered of archdevils. The 
ultimate evil he represents can be seen only when he 
wills it so, or if he forgets himself and flies into a rage. 
ACHERON 
Acheron has four layers, each made of enormous iron 
cubes floating in an airy void. Sometimes the cubes 
collide. Echoes of past collisions linger throughout the 
plane, mingling with the sounds of armies colliding. 
That's the nature of Acheron: strife and war, as the 
spirits of fallen soldiers join in endless battle against 
orcs devoted to Gruumsh, goblinoids loyal to Maglubiyet, 
and legions assembled by other warmongering gods. 
OPTIONAL RULE: BLOODLUST 
Acheron rewards a creature for harming other creatures 
by imbuing that creature with the strength to keep 
fighting. While on Acheron, a creature gains temporary 
hit points equal to half its hit point maximum whenever 
it reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points. 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTTVERSE MECHANUS 
On Meehan us, law is reflected in a realm of clockwork 
gears. all interlocked and turning according to their 
measure. The cogs seem to be engaged in a calculation 
so vast that no deity can fathom its purpose. Mechanus 
embodies absolute order, and its influence can be felt on 
those who spend time here. 
Modrons are the primary inhabitants of Mechanus. 
The plane is also home to the creator of the modrons: a 
godlike being called Primus. 
OPTIONAL RULE: LAW OF AVERAGES 
While on Mechanus, creatures always use the average 
damage result for attacks and spells. For example, an 
attack that normally deals ldlO + 5 damage always 
deals 10 damage on Mechanus. 
OPTIONAL RULE: IMPOSING ORDER 
At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor 
that isn't lawful neutral must make a DC 10 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment 
changes to lawful neutral. The creature's alignment 
reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other 
than Mechanus. Casting the dispel evil and good spell 
on the creature also restores its original alignment. 
ARCADI ~A~---------------------­
Arcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees, 
ruler-straight streams, orderly fields, perfect roads, and 
cities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The 
mountains are unblemished by erosion. Everything on 
Arcadia works toward the common good and a flawless 
form of existence. Here, purity is eternal, and nothing 
intrudes on harmony. 
Night and day are determined by an orb that floats 
above Arcadia's highest peak. Half of the orb radiates 
sunlight and brings about the day; the other half sheds 
moonlight and brings on the starry night. The orb 
rotates evenly without fail, spreading day and night 
across the entire plane. 
The weather in Arcadia is governed by four allied 
demigods called the Storm Kings: the Cloud King, the 
Wind Queen, the Lightning King, and the Rain Queen. 
Each one lives in a castle surrounded by the type of 
weather that king or queen controls. 
Hidden below Arcadia's beautiful mountains are 
numerous dwarven kingdoms that have withstood 
the passage of millennia. Dwarves born on this plane 
have the celestial type and are always brave and 
kindhearted, but otherwise they look and behave like 
normal dwarves. 
OPTIONAL RULE: PLANAR VITALITY 
Vhile on this plane, creatures can't be frightened or 
poisoned, and they are immune to disease and poison. 
OTHER PLANES 
A variety of realms exist between or beyond the 
other planes. 
THE OUTLANDS AND SIGIL 
The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes. 
Ir is the plane of neutrality, incorporating a little of 
everything and keeping all aspects in a paradoxical 
balance-simultaneously concordant and in opposition. 
The plane has varied terrain, with prairies, mountains , 
and shallow rivers. 
The Outlands is circular, like a great disk. In fact, 
£hose whp envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point 
(Q the ovtlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the 
planes. That argument might be circular, since the 
arrange~ent of the Outlands inspired the idea of the 
Great \\\heel in the first place. 
Aroun'd the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, 
are the g~te-towns: sixteen settlements , each built 
around a ~ortalleading to one of the Outer Planes. Each 
rown shares many of the characteristics of the plane where its gate leads. Planar emissaries often meet in 
these towns, so it isn't unusual to see strange pairings, 
such as a celestial and a fiend arguing in a tavern while 
sharing a fine bottle of wine. 
Given the fact that you can ride a horse in the 
Outlands from a heaven to a hell, a planar-themed 
campaign can be set there without the need for planar 
travel. The Outlands is the closest the Outer Planes 
come to being like a world on the Material Plane.

CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE 
68 SIGIL, CITY OF DOORS 
At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of a great 
wheel, is the Spire-a needle-shaped mountain that 
rises high into the sky. Above this mountain 's narrow 
peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, its myriad 
structures built on the ring's inner rim. Creatures 
standing on one of Sigil's streets can see the city curve 
up over their heads and-most disconcerting of all-the 
far side of the city directly overhead. Called the City of 
Doors, this bustling planar metropolis holds countless 
portals to other planes and worlds. 
Sigil is a trader's paradise. Goods, merchandise, and 
information come here from across the planes. The city 
sustains a brisk trade in information about the planes, 
particularly the command words or items required for 
the operation of particular portals. Portal keys of all 
kinds are bought and sold here. 
The city is the domain of the inscrutable Lady of Pain, 
a being as old as gods and with purposes unknown to 
even the sages of her city. Is Sigil her prison? Is she the 
fallen creator of the multiverse? No one knows. Or if 
they do, they aren't telling. 
DEMIPLANES 
Demiplanes are extradimensional spaces that come 
into being by a variety of means and boast their own 
physical laws. Some are created by spells. Others exist 
naturally, as folds of reality pinched off from the rest 
of the multiverse. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can 
carry travelers to a demiplane , but the proper frequency 
required for the tuning fork would be extremely hard to 
acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the 
caster knows of the demiplane. 
A demiplane can be as small as a single chamber or 
large enough to contain an entire realm. For example, 
a Mordenkainen 's magnificent mansion spell creates a 
demiplane consisting of a foyer with multiple adjoining 
rooms, while the land of Barovia (in the Ravenloft 
setting) exists entirely within a demiplane under the 
sway of its vampire lord, Strahd von Zarovich. When a 
demiplane is connected to the Material Plane or some 
other plane, entering it can be as simple as stepping 
through a portal or passing through a wall of mist. 
THE FAR REALM 
The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In 
fact, it might be an entirely separate universe with its 
own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies 
from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter 
is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable 
geometry and biology. Aberrations such as mind flayers 
and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its 
strange influence. 
The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are 
too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain. 
Titanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and 
unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who 
dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm 
is a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of 
matter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this 
struggle by forming pacts with entities there. Anyone 
CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE I 
who has seen the Far Realm mutters about eyes, 
tentacles. and horror. 
The Far Realm has no well-know;n portals, or at least 
none that are still viable. Ancient elves once opened a 
vast portal to the Far Realm within~ mountain called 
Firestorm Peak, but their civilizatio i imploded in bloody 
terror and the portal's location-eve 
1 its home world-is 
long forgotten. Lost portals might still exist, marked by 
an alien magic that mutates the area kround them. 
KNOWN WORLDS dF THE I MATERIAL PLANE 
Worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse. The 
most widely known worlds are the ones that have been 
published as official campaign settings for the D&D 
game over the years. If your campaign takes place on 
one of these worlds, that world belongs to you in your 
campaign. Your version of the world can diverge wildly 
from what's in print. 
On Toril (the heroic-fantasy world of the Forgotten 
Realms setting), fantastic cities and kingdoms stand 
amid the remains of ancient empires and realms 
long forgotten. The world is vast, its dungeons rich 
with history. Beyond the central continent of Faerun, 
Tori! includes the regions of Al-Qadim , Kara-Tur , 
and Maztica. 
On Oerth (the sword-and-sorcery world of the 
Greyhawk setting), heroes such as Bigby and 
Mordenkainen are driven by greed or ambition. The 
hub of the region called the Flanaess is the Free City of 
Greyhawk, a city of scoundrels and arch magi, rife with 
adventure. An evil demigod, Iuz, rules a nightmarish 
realm in the north, threatening all civilization. 
On Krynn (the epic-fantasy world of the Dragonlance 
setting),. the return of the gods is overshadowed by the 
rise of the evil dragon queen Takhisis and her dragons 
and dragonarmies, which plunge the continent of 
Ansalon into war. 
On Athas (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Dark 
Sun setting), a drop of water can be worth more than a 
human life. The gods have abandoned this desert world, 
where powerful sorcerer-kings rule as tyrants, and 
metal is a scarce and precious commodity. 
On Eberron (the heroic-fantasy world of the Eberron 
setting), a terrible war has ended, giving rise to a cold 
war fueled by political intrigue. On the continent of 
Khorvaire, magic is commonplace, dragonmarked 
houses rival kingdoms in power, and elemental vehicles 
make travel to the far corners of the world possible. 
On Aebrynis (the heroic-fantasy world of the 
Birthright setting), scions born from divine bloodlines 
carve up the continent of Cerilia. Monarchs, prelates, 
guildmasters , and great wizards balance the demands 
of rulership against the threat of horrible abominations 
born from the blood of an evil god. 
On Mystara (a heroic-fantasy world born out of the 
earliest editions of the D&D game), diverse cultures, 
savage monsters , and warring empires collide. 
The world is further shaped by the meddling of the 
Immortals -former adventurers raised to nearly 
divine status. 
I' A 

CHAPTER 3: CREATING ADVENTURES 
~ REATI G ADVENTURES IS ONE OF THE GREATEST 
rewards of being a Dungeon Master. It's a 
way to express yourself, designing fantastic 
locations and encounters with monsters, 
traps, puzzles, and conflicts. When you 
design an adventure, you call the shots. You 
o things exactly the way you want to. 
Fundamentally, adventures are stories. An adventure 
shares many of the features of a novel, a movie, an 
:ssue of a comic, or an episode of a TV show. Comic 
series and serialized TV dramas are particularly good 
comparisons, because of the way individual adventures 
are limited in scope but blend together to create a larger 
narrative. If an adventure is a single issue or episode, a 
campaign is the series as a whole. 
Whether you're creating your own adventures or using 
;JUblished adventures, you'll find advice in this chapter 
~o help you create a fun and memorable experience for 
:.·our players. 
Creating an adventure involves blending scenes of 
exploration, social interaction, and combat into a unified 
whole that meets the needs of your players and your 
campaign. But it's more than that. The basic elements 
of good storytelling should guide you throughout this 
;Jrocess, so your players experience the adventure as a 
-ory and not a disjointed series of encounters. 
ELEMENTS OF A 
GREAT ADVENTURE 
-=-he best adventures have several things in common. 
_-\_ CREDIBLE THREAT 
_-\n adventure needs a threat worthy of the heroes' 
c. rention. The threat might be a single villain or 
;:nonster, a villain with lackeys, an assortment of 
::::wnsters, or an evil organization. Whatever their 
arure, the antagonists should have goals that the 
:-:eroes can uncover and thwart. 
?.-\MILlAR TROPES WITH CLEVER TWISTS 
:-might seem stereotypical to build an adventure 
;;sound dragons, orcs, and insane wizards in towers, 
"Jut these are staples of fantasy storytelling. It might 
also seem trite to begin an adventure in a tavern, but 
~hat's an idea that remains true to D&D. Familiar 
srory elements are fine, as long as you and the players 
occasionally put a spin on them. For example, the 
:-nysterious figure who presents adventurers with 
a quest on behalf of the king might be the king in 
d.isguise. The crazy wizard in the tower might be a 
;Jrojected illusion created by a band of greedy gnome 
dlieves to guard their loot. 
_\ CLEAR Focus oN THE PRESENT 
.-ill adventure is about the here and now. A little bit 
of history might be needed to set the story in motion, 
and the adventurers might discover interesting lore of 
:.1e past in the course of the adventure. In general, let rhe world's history be evident in the present situation. 
Instead of dealing with what happened in the past, 
an adventure should focus on describing the present 
situation, what the bad guys are up to, and how the 
adventurers become involved in the story. 
HEROES WHO MATTER 
An adventur e should allow the adventurers' actions and 
decisions to matter. Though it might resemble a novel 
or a TV episode, an adventure needs to allow for more 
than one outcome. Otherwise, players can feel as if 
they've been railroaded -set onto a course that has only 
one destination, no matter how hard they try to change 
it. For example, if a major villain shows up before the 
end of the adventure , the adventure should allow for the 
possibility that the heroes might defeat that villain. 
SoMETHING FOR ALL PLAYER TYPES 
As outlined in the book's introduction , players come 
to the gaming table with different expectations. An 
adventure needs to account for the different players and 
characters in your group, drawing them into the story as 
effectively as possible. 
As a starting point, think about your adventure in 
terms of the three basic types of activity in the game: 
exploration, social interaction, and combat. If your 
adventure includes a balance of all three, it's likely to 
appeal to all types of players. 
An adventure you create for your home campaign 
doesn't have to appeal to every abstract player type­
only to the players sitting down at your own table. If you 
don't have any players who like fighting above all else, 
then don't feel you have to provide a maximum amount 
of combat to keep the adventure moving. 
SURPRISES 
Look for opportunities to surprise and delight your 
players. For example, the exploration of a ruined castle 
on a hill might lead to the discovery of a dragon's tomb 
hidden underneath. A trek through the wilderness 
might lead to the discovery of a tower that appears only 
on nights of the full moon. Players remember such 
locations. 
Too many surprises can be off-putting to players, but 
adding the occasional twist gets players to adjust their 
tactics and think creatively. For example , you could 
spruce up a goblin lair by including goblin sappers 
with kegs of oil strapped to their backs. An attack on a 
villain's estate might be complicated by the unexpected 
arrival of a special guest. 
When preparing for possible combat encounters, 
think about odd pairings of monsters, such as a 
hobgoblin warlord and his pet manticore , or will­
o'-wisps in league with a young black dragon. Have 
surprise reinforcements show up, or give the monsters 
unusual tactics. Throw in the occasional red herring, 
deception, and plot twist to keep players on their toes, 
but try not to go overboard. Sometimes a simple, 
straightforward encounter with an ore guard is just as 
fun for your players. 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES 
USEFUL MAPS 
A good adventure needs thoughtfully constructed 
maps. Wilderness areas sprinkled with interesting 
landmarks and other features are better than vast 
expanses of unchanging terrain. Dungeons that have 
branching corridors and similar decision points give 
players the opportunity to choose which direction their 
characters should go. Presenting the characters with 
options allows the players to make choices that keep the 
adventure unpredictable. 
If drawing maps isn't your strong suit, the Internet is 
a great place to look for adventur e maps that have been 
made freely available for use, as well as floor plans of 
real-world buildings and images that can inspire your 
mapmaking. You can also use software to help put your 
maps together. 
PUBLISHED ADVENTURES 
Published adventures are available for purchase if you 
have neither the time nor the inclination to write an 
adventure of your own, or if you want a change of pace. 
A published adventure includes a pregenerated scenario 
with the maps, NPCs, monsters, and treasures you need 
to run it. An example of a published adventur e appears 
in the D&D Starter Set. 
You can make adjustments to a published adventure 
so that it better suits your campaign and appeals to 
your players. For example , you can replace the villain 
of an adventure with one the players have already 
encountered in your campaign, or add something to 
the background of the adventure so that it involves your 
players' characters in ways that the adventure's designer 
never could have imagined. 
A published adventure can't account for every 
action the characters might take. The nice thing 
about published adventur es is that they allow you to 
focus your game preparation time on highlighting plot 
developments in your campaign that the adventure 
can't address. 
Published adventures also provide inspiration. You 
might not use an adventure as written, but it might spur 
ideas, or you can pull out one part of it and repurpose 
that part for your needs. For example, you might use a 
map of a temple but repopulate it with monsters of your 
choice, or you might use a chase sequence as a model 
for a pursuit scene in your campaign . 
ADVENTURE STRUCTURE 
Like every story, a typical adventure has a beginning, a 
middle, and an end. 
BEGINNING 
An adventure starts with a hook to get the players 
interested. A good adventure hook piques the interest 
of the players and provides a compelling reason for 
their characters to become involved in the adventur e. 
Maybe the adventurers stumble onto something they're 
not meant to see, monsters attack them on the road, an 
assassin makes an attempt on their lives, or a dragon 
shows up at the city gates. Adventure hooks such as 
these can instantly draw players into your story. 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATJNG ADVENTURES The beginning of a good adventure should be exciting 
and focused. You want the players to go home looking 
forward to the next session, so give them a clear sense 
of where the story is headed, as well as something to 
look forward to. 
MIDDLE 
The middle of an adventure is where the bulk of the 
story unfolds. With each new challenge, the adventurers 
make important choices that have a clear effect on the 
conclusion of the adventure . 
Over the course of the adventure, the characters might 
discover secrets that reveal new goals or change their 
original goal. Their understanding of what's going on 
around them might change. Maybe rumors of treasure 
were a trick to lure them into a death trap. Perhaps 
the so-called spy in the queen's court is actually a 
scheme concocted by the monarch herself to seize even 
more power. 
At the same time the adventurers are working to 
thwart their adversaries, those adversaries are trying 
to carry out their nefarious plans. Such enemies 
might also work to hide their deeds, mislead potential 
adversaries, or confront problems directly, perhaps by 
trying to kill meddlers. 
Remember that the characters are the heroes of the 
story. Never let them become mere spectators, watching 
as events unfold around them that they can't influence. 
ENDING 
The ending encompasses the climax-the scene or 
encounter in which the tension building throughout the 
adventure reaches its peak. A strong climax should have 
the players on edge, with the fate of the characters and 
much more hanging in the balance. The outcome , which 
hinges on the characters' actions and decisions, should 
never be a forgone conclusion. 
An ending needn't tie everything up in a neat bow. 
Story threads can be left hanging, waiting to be resolved 
in a later adventure. A little bit of unfinished business is 
an easy way to transition from one adventure to the next. 
ADVENTURE TYPES 
An adventure can be location-based or event-based, as 
discussed in the sections that follow. 
LOCATION-BASED ADVENTURES 
Adventures set in crumbling dungeons and remote 
wilderness locations are the cornerstone of countless 
campaigns. Many of the greatest D&D adventures of all 
time are location-based. 
Creating a location-bas ed adventure can be broken 
down into a number of steps. Each step provides tables 
from which you can select the basic elements of your 
adventure. Alternatively , roll on the tables and see how 
the random results inspire you. You can mix up the 
order of the steps. 
1. IDENTIFY THE PARTY'S GOALS

that drive or lure adventurers into dungeons. The

3. FLESH OuT THE LocATION DETAILS 
Chapter 5 offers suggestions for creating and fleshing 
out an adventure location, including tables that can 
help you establish the important elements of a dungeon, 
wilderness area, or urban setting. 
4. FIND THE IDEAL INTRODUCTION 
An adventure can begin with a social interaction 
encounter in which the adventurers find out what they 
must do and why. It can start with a surprise attack, 
or with the adventur ers coming across information by 
accident. The best introductions arise naturally from the 
goals and setting of the adventure. Let the entries in the 
Adventure Introduction table inspire you.

The dungeon begins to collapse while the 
adventurers face the main villain, who attempts to

its attention on the characters. 
The adventurers must choose whether to pursue 
the fleeing main villain or save an N PC they care 
about or a group of innocents. 
The adventurers must discover the main villain's 
secret weakness before they can hope to defeat that 
villain. 
6. PLAN ENCOUNTE RS 
.:..fter you've created the location and the overall story of 
the adventure, it's time to plan out the encounters that 
make up that adventure. In a location-based adventure , 
most encounters are keyed to specific locations on 
a map. For each room or wilderness area on the 
adventure map, your key describes what's in that area: 
its physical features, as well as any encounter that plays 
out there. The adventure key turns a simple sketch 
of numbered areas on graph paper into encounters 
designed to entertain and intrigue your players. 
See "Creating Encounters" later in this chapter for 
guidance on crafting individual encounters. EVENT- BASED ADVENTURES 
In an event-based adventur e, the focus is on what the 
characters and villains do and what happens as a 
result. The question of where those things happen is of 
secondary importance. 
Building an event-based adventure is more work than 
building a location-based one, but the process can be 
simplified by following a number of straightforward 
steps. Several steps include tables from which you 
can choose adventure elements or roll randomly for 
inspiration . As with location-based adventures, you don't 
necessarily have to follow these steps in order. 
1. START WITH A VILLAIN 
Putting care into creating your villain will pay off later, 
since the villain plays such a pivotal role in advancing 
the story. Use the Adventure Villains table in the 
previous section to get started, and use the information 
in chapter 4 to help flesh out the villain. 
For example, your villain might be an undead creature 
seeking to avenge a past imprisonment or injury. An 
interesting aspect of an undead villain is that this past 
injury might have occurred centuries ago, inspiring 
revenge against the descendants of those that harmed 
it. Imagine a vampire imprisoned by the members of a 
religious order of knights, and who now seeks revenge 
against the current members of that order. 
2. DETERMINE THE VILLAIN'S ACTIONS 
Once you have a villain, it's time to determine what 
steps the villain takes to achieve its goals. Create a 
timeline showing what the villain does and when, 
assuming no interference from the adventurers. 
Building on the previous example, you might decide 
that your vampire villain murders several knights. By 
slipping past locked doors in gaseous form, the vampire 
is able to make the deaths appear natural at first, but 
it soon becomes clear that a depraved killer is behind 
the murders. 
If you need additional inspiration , consider a few 
different options for how the villain's actions unfold over 
the course of the adventure.

Step by step 
Big Event. The villain's plans come to fruition during 
a festival, an astrological event, a holy (or unholy) rite, a 
royal wedding , the birth of a child, or some similar fixed 
time. The villain's activities up to that point are geared 
toward preparation for this event. 
Crime Spree. The villain commits acts that become 
bolder and more heinous over time. A killer might start 
out by targeting the destitute in the city slums before 
moving up to a massacre in the marketplace , increasing 
the horror and the body count each time. 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATTNG ADVEN TURES 75 
VAMPIRE VILLAIN 
Growing Corruption. As time passes, the villain's 
power and influence grow, affecting more victims 
across a larger area. This might take the form of armies 
conquering new territory, an evil cult recruiting new 
members, or a spreading plague. A pretender to the 
throne might attempt to secure the support of the 
kingdom's nobility in the days or weeks leading up to a 
coup, or a guild leader could corrupt the members of a 
town council or bribe officers of the watch. 
One and Done. The villain commits a single crime 
and then tries to avoid the consequences. Instead of an 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADYENTURES ongoing plan to commit more crimes, the villain's goal is 
to lie low or flee the scene. 
Serial Crimes. The villain commits crimes one after 
the other, but these acts are repetitive in nature, rather 
than escalating to greater heights of depravity. The 
trick to catching such a villain lies in determining the 
pattern underlying the crimes. Though serial killers are 
a common example of this type of villain, your villain 
could be a serial arsonist favoring a certain type of 
building, a magical sickness that affects spellcasters 
who cast a specific spell, a thief that targets a certain 
kind of merchant, or a doppelganger kidnapping and 
impersonating one noble after another. 
Step by Step. In pursuit of its goal, the villain carries 
out a specific set of actions in a particular sequence. 
A wizard might steal the items needed to create a 
phylactery and become a lich, or a cultist might kidnap 
the priests of seven good-aligned gods as a sacrifice. 
Alternatively, the villain could be following a trail to find 
the object of its revenge, killing one victim after another 
while moving ever closer to the real target. 
3. DETERMINE THE PARTY'S GOALS 
You can use the Event-Based Goals table to set the 
party's goal. A goal can also suggest ways in which the 
adventurers become caught up in the villain's plans, and 
what exactly they must do to foil those plans. 
EVENT-BASED GOALS 
d20 Goal 
Bring the villain to justice. 
2 Clear the name of an innocent N PC. 
3 Protect or hide an N PC. 
4 Protect an object. 
5 Discover the nature and origin of a strange 
phenomenon that might be the villain's doing. 
6 Find a wanted fugitive. 
7 Overthrow a tyrant. 
8 Uncover a conspiracy to overthrow a ruler. 
9 Negotiate peace between enemy nations or feuding 
families. 
10 Secure aid from a ruler or council.

15 Parley with a villain.

17 Determine the villain's identity. 
18 Locate a stolen item. 
19 Make sure a wedding goes off without a hitch. 
20 Roll twice, ignoring results of 20. 
For example, you roll a 10 on the table, indicating that 
the party's goal is to secure aid from a ruler or council. 
You decide to connect that to the leadership of the order 
targeted by your vampire villain. Maybe the order's 
leaders have a chest of jewels stolen from the vampire 
centuries ago, and the characters can use the chest as 
bait to trap the villain. 
-=· IDENTIFY IMPORTANT NPCs 
~any event-based adventures require a well-detailed 
;-t of NPCs. Some of these NPCs fall neatly into the 
:. egories of allies and patrons, but most are likely to 
:-:: characters or creatures whose attitudes toward the 
~.>.-enturers remain undecided until the adventurers 
-:.ceract with them. (See chapter 4 for more information 
;:J. creating NPCs.) 
The elements of the adventure you've determined

:::: ail you need to generate for each one. NPCs unlikely 
J become involved in combat don't need full combat 
:::atistics, for example , just as characters heavily 
::';olved in negotiation could have ideals, bonds, and 
.:aws. If it's helpful, roll on the Adventure Allies or

~-,·entures" section, earlier in this chapter). 
-. ANTICIPATE THE VILLAIN'S REACTIONS 
'-.s the adventurers pursue their goals and foil the 
:.:lain's plans, how does the villain respond? Does it 
a-h out in violence or send dire warnings? Does it 
ClOk for simple solutions to its problems or create more

Look over the villain's actions that you outlined in 
:;·ep 2. For each event arising from those actions, think 
about how the adventurers are likely to react. If they 
:an prevent an action or hamper its success, what effect 
::oes that have on the villain's overall plan? What can

One way to track a villain's reactions is by using a 
:':owchart. This might grow out of the timeline that 
;:!escribes the villain's plans, outlining how the villain 
gets back on track after the adventurers thwart its plans. 
Or the flowchart could be separate from the timeline, 
·hawing the various actions the adventurers might take 
and the villain's response to those actions. 
6. DETAIL KEY LOCATIONS 
~ ince locations aren't the focus of the adventure, they 
an be simpler and smaller than a dungeon complex 
or an expanse of wilderness. They might be specific 
. ocations in a city, or even individual rooms in locations 
·,yhere combat is likely to break out or significant 
exploration is needed, such as a throne room, a guild 
~eadquarters , a vampire's crumbling manor, or a 
~ights' chapter house. 
7. CHOOSE AN INTRODUCTION AND A CLIMAX 
The Adventure Introduction table in the "Location­
Based Adventures" section offers fun possibilities 
:or hooking the characters into the events of your 
adventure, including dreams, hauntings, and a simple 
plea for help. The Adventure Climax table in that same 
-ection includes adventure endings that work just as 
well for event-based adventures. 
For example, the Adventure Introduction table helps 
you decide that an ally the adventurers care about needs 
their help. Perhaps the NPC is a knight who believes 
that a vampire is trying to kill him, or a friend or relative hoping to find the knight's murderer. This NPC brings 
the vampire's crimes to the characters' attention . 
Looking over the Adventur e Climax table, you might 
decide to have the adventur ers bait the vampire with a 
chest of jewels stolen from its lair. As an added twist, 
you decide that the vampire's true goal is to retrieve a 
necklace among the jewels. The necklace is set with 
nine gems, and with these gems the vampire can open 
a gate to the Nine Hells. Should the vampire succeed, 
the adventurers will have a more pressing threat to deal 
with, as a powerful devil steps through the gate and 
honors some ancient pact it made with the vampire. 
8. PLAN ENCOUNTERS 
After you've created the overall story of the adventure, 
it's time to plan out the encounters on which the 
events of that adventure will hang. In an event-based 
adventure, encounters occur when the villain's agenda 
intersects the path of the characters . You can't always 
anticipate exactly when or where that will happen, but 
you can create a list of possible encounters that the 
adventurers might experience. This can take the form of 
general descriptions of the villain's forces, details of its 
lieutenants and minions, as well as encounters tied to 
the key locations of the adventur e. 
See "Creating Encounters " later in this chapter for 
guidance on crafting individual encounters. 
MYSTERIES 
A mystery is a form of event-based adventure that 
usually focuses on the adventurers ' efforts to solve a 
crime, usually a robbery or murder. Unlike the writer of 
a mystery novel, a Dungeon Master can't always predict 
what the characters will do in a mystery adventure. 
A villain whose actions are "crime spree," "one and 
done," or "serial crimes" might inspire you to craft 
a mystery adventure around that villain's crimes. 
Similarly, if the adventurers ' goals include determining 
the villain's identity, that might be part of a mystery. 
To build a mystery adventure , follow the steps for 
creating any event-based adventure. Then consider 
three additional elements for the adventure: the victim, 
the suspects, and the clues . 
VICTIM 
Think about the victim's relationship to the villain. 
Though you can create a strong scenario with no such 
relationship , part of what makes a mystery exciting is 
the discovery of the twisted connections between NPCs 
and how those connections led to the crime. A random 
killing might be just as mysterious , but it lacks that 
emotional connection . 
Also look for a connection between the victim and one 
or more of the adventurers. One surefire way to draw 
adventurers into a mystery-including making them 
suspects -is to make the victim someone with whom the 
characters are acquainted. 
SUSPECTS 
Your cast of characters should include an assortment 
of other NPCs who didn't commit the crime, but who 
had the motive, the means, or the opportunity to do so. 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES 
77 
Suspects might be obvious or could come to light during 
the investigation. One technique often used in detective 
fiction is to create a closed circle of suspects-a finite 
number of individuals whose circumstances make them 
the only possible suspects. 
One tip for keeping the players and the adventurers 
guessing as to the identity of the villain is to ensure that 
more than one suspect has a secret. When question ed 
by the adventurers, a suspect might appear nervous or 
attempt to lie, despite being innocent of the crime. A 
secret business deal, an illicit affair, a dark past, or an 
uncontrolled vice are flaws that make suspects more 
interestin g than NPCs with nothing to hide. 
CLUES 
Clues point to the identity of the villain. Some clues are 
verbal, including the statements of the suspects and 
witnesses that help the adventurers develop a picture 
of what happened. Other clues are physical, such as an 
unfinished message written in the victim's blood, a piece 
of jewelry left behind by the villain, or a weapon found 
hidden in a suspect's room. 
A clue should connect a suspect to the crime, typically 
by shedding light on the suspect's motive, means, or 
opportunity. Some clues connect the wrong suspect 
to the crime, leading the adventurers in the wrong 
direction. Eventually , they must find other clues pointing 
in a different direction, or come across evidence that 
absolves the suspect. 
It's better to populate your adventure with too many 
clues than too few. If the adventurers solve the mystery 
too quickly, you might feel some disappointment but 
the players will feel a sense of accomplishment. If the 
mystery is too hard, though, the players will become 
frustrated . Since you have to account for the possibilit y 
that the adventurers will overlook some clues, use 
redundant clues to ensure that the players have the 
knowledge needed to catch the villain. 
INTRIGUE ----
Intrigue adventures are event-based adventures that 
revolve around power struggles. Intrigues are common 
in the courts of the nobility, but power struggles can 
play out just as easily in merchants ' guilds, crime 
syndicates , and temple hierarchies. 
Rather than dark events and villainous plots, an 
intrigue adventure typically revolves around the 
exchange of favors, the rise and fall of individuals 
in power and influence, and the honeyed words of 
diplomacy. A prince's efforts to be named heir to the 
throne, a courtier's ambition to sit at the queen's right 
hand, and a merchant's desire to open a trade route 
through enemy lands are the stuff of intrigue. 
Like all adventures, an intrigue adventure works only 
if the players and their characters are invested in the 
outcome. If no one cares who the king's chamberlain is 
or who has logging rights in the elven woods, throwing 
the characters into an adventure centered on those 
issues will fall fiat. However, if having the ear of the 
king's chamberlain means the characters can use royal 
soldiers to help them defend their own stronghold on the 
borderlands, players will be invested in the scenario. 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES Adventurers usually become embroiled in intrigue 
when they need a favor from a powerful creature and 
have to perform a favor in exchange, or when the plots 
of powerful NPCs get in the way of the characters 
achieving their goals. Some of the event-based goals 
discussed earlier in this section lend themselves to 
intrigue adventures. For example, if the adventurers 
must uncover a conspiracy, negotiate a peace treaty, or 
secure aid from a ruler or council, you might be looking 
at an intrigue adventure. 
The process of creating an intrigue adventure is 
similar to creating any other event-based adventure , 
with two main differences: how villains are handled and 
how the characters can gain influence. 
VILLAINS 
Some intrigue adventures are driven by the actions of a 
single villain, such as a noble plotting the assassination 
of a monarch. However, an intrigue adventure can have 
multiple villains or no villain at all. 
No Villain. Some intrigue adventures revolve around 
the exchange of favors in the absence of a villain. For 
this type of adventure, skip steps 1 and 2 of the event­
based adventure creation process (the villain and the 
villain's actions) and move straight to the adventurers ' 
goals in step 3. Figure out why the adventurers become 
involved in the intrigue, then spend the bulk of your time 
creating the NPCs they interact with. 
Many Villains. Some intrigue adventures feature 
a whole cast of villains, each with its own goals, 
motivations, and methods. The adventurers might be 
drawn into the struggle of a court full of nobles vying 
for the throne in the wake of the king's sudden death, 
or could find themselv es negotiating the end to a deadly 
turf war among thieves' guilds. In this scenario, you'll 
spend a lot of time on steps 1 and 2, developing each of 
the major NPCs as a distinct villain with an agenda. 
In step 5, you'll need to develop each villain's reactions 
to the potential setbacks they face during the adventur e. 
However, you don't need to put equal effort into detailing 
the reactions of every villain, since many will likely 
echo each other or cancel each other out. Whenever 
the adventurers foil one villain's plans, it might let 
another villain's schemes move forward, advancing the 
adventure whether the foiled villain reacts or not. 
INFLUENCE 
Depending on the scenario, you might want to track 
the party's influence with different NPCs or factions, or 
even track influence separately for each character. 
One way to handle influence is to treat it like 
inspiration. A character gains influence in a certain 
situation only if you grant it, and bringing influence 
into play requires spending it. Characters can gain 
influence by doing favors for NPCs, advancing the 
cause of an organization , or demonstrating their power 
and heroism, at your discretio n. As with inspiration , 
a character can choose to spend influence to gain 
advantag e on a roll relevant to that influence. 
Another way to handle influence is to treat it like 
renown (see chapter 1), allowing characters to gain 
renown at court and within various key factions.

COMPLICATIONS 
Sometimes an adventure isn't as straightforwa rd as it 
might seem. 
MORAL QUANDARIES 
If you want to give the characters a crisis that no amount 
of spellcasting or swordplay can resolve, add a moral 
quandary to the adventure. A moral quandary is a 
problem of conscience for which the adventurers must 
make a single choice-but never a simple one.

8o Ally Quandary. The adventurers have a better chance 
of achieving their goal with the help of two individuals 
whose expertise is all but essential. However, these 
two NPCs hate each other and refuse to work together 
even if the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The 
adventurers must choose the NPC that is most likely to 
help them accomplish their goal. 
Friend Quandary. An NPC that one or more of the 
characters cares about makes an impossible demand 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES on the characters . A love interest might demand that 
a character turn away from a dangerous quest. A 
dear friend might plead with the characters to spare 
the villain's life, to prove that they are better than the 
villain. A weak NPC might beg for a chance to win favor 
from the characters by undertaking a dangerous but 
essential mission. 
Honor Quandary. A character is forced to choose 
between victory and a personal oath or code of honor. 
A paladin who has sworn the Oath of Virtue might 
realize that the clearest path to success lies in deceit 
and subterfuge. A Joyal cleric might be tempted to 
disobey the orders of his or her faith. If you present 
this quandary , be sure to provide an opportunity for a 
character to atone for violating his or her oath. 
Rescue Quandary. The adventur ers must choose 
between catching or hurting the villain and saving 
innocent lives. For example, the adventurers might 
learn that the villain is camped nearby, but they also 
learn that another part of the villain's forces is about 
to march into a village and burn it to the ground. The 
characters must choose between taking out the villain 
or protecting innocent villagers, some of whom might be 
friends or family members. 
Respect Quandary. Two important allies give 
conflicting directions or advice to the adventurers . 
Perhaps the high priest counsels the characters to 
negotiate peace with militaristic elves in the nearby 
forest, while a veteran warrior urges them to prove their 
strength with a decisive first strike. The adventurers 
can't follow both courses, and whichever ally they 
choose, the other loses respect for them and might no 
longer aid them.

CREATING ENCOUNTERS 
:::ncounters are the individual scenes in the larger story 
of your adventure . 
First and foremost, an encounter should be fun for 
~he players. Second, it shouldn't be burden for you to 
:un. Beyond that, a well-crafted encounter usually has 
a straightforward objective as well as some connection 
to the overarching story of your campaign, building on 
the encounters that precede it while foreshadowing 
encounters yet to come. 
An encounter has one of three possible outcomes: 
!he characters succeed, the characters partly succeed, 
or the characters faiL The encounter needs to account 
for all three possibilities, and the outcome needs to 
have consequences so that the players feel like their 
successes and failures matter. 
CHARACTER OBJECTIVES 
When players don't know what they're supposed to do 
in a given encounter, anticipation and excitement can 
quickly turn to boredom and frustration. A transparent 
objective alleviates the risk of players losing interest. 
For example, if the overall story of your adventure 
involves a quest to deliver a priceless relic to a remote 
monastery, each encounter along the way is an 
opportunity to introduce a smaller objective that moves 
the quest forward. Encounters during the trip might 
see the adventurers accosted by enemies determined 
to steal the relic, or by monsters that are constantl y 
threatening the monastery. 
Some players create their own objectives, which is to 
be expected and encouraged. It is, after all, as much the 
players' campaign as yours. For example , a character 
might try to bribe enemies rather than fight them, 
or chase after a fleeing enemy to see where it goes. 
Players who ignore objectives will have to deal with 
the consequences , which is another important facet of 
encounter design. : -~-.• ~?=-~ OE ~~ c-:-::T=: s 
~~e io owing objectiYes can be u ed as foundations 
for encounter . Although these objectives focus on a 
single encounter during an adventure, using the same 
objective in multiple encounters allows you to combine 
those encounters into a larger obstacle or problem the 
adventurers must overcome. 
Make Peace. The characters must convince two 
opposing groups (or their leaders) to end the conflict 
that embroils them. As a complication , the characters 
might have enemies on one or both of the opposing 
sides, or some other group or individual might be 
instigating the conflict to further its own ends. 
Protect an NPC or Object. The characters must act 
as bodyguards or protect some object in their custody. 
As a complication, the NPC under the party's protection 
might be cursed, diseased , prone to panic attacks, too 
young or too old to fight, or apt to risk the lives of the 
adventurers through dubious decisions. The object the 
adventurers have sworn to protect might be sentient, 
cursed, or difficult to transport. 
Retrieve an Object. The adventurers must gain 
possession of a specific object in the area of the 
encounter, preferably before combat finishes. As a 
complication, enemies might desire the object as much 
as the adventurers do, forcing both parties to fight for it. 
Run a Gauntlet. The adventurers must pass through 
a dangerous area. This objective is similar to retrieving 
an object insofar as reaching the exit is a higher priority 
than killing opponents in the area. A time limit adds a 
complication, as does a decision point that might lead 
characters astray. Other complications include traps, 
hazards, and monsters . 
Sneak In. The adventurers need to move through the 
encounter area without making their enemies aware 
of their presence. Complications might ensue if they 
are detected. 
Stop a Ritual. The plots of evil cult leaders, 
malevolent warlocks, and powerful fiends often involve 
rituals that must be foiled. Characters engaged in 
stopping a ritual must typically fight their way through 
evil minions before attempting to disrupt the ritual's 
powerful magic. As a complication , the ritual might 
be close to completion when the characters arrive, 
imposing a time limit. Depending on the ritual, its 
completion might have immediate consequences as welL 
Take Out a Single Target. The villain is surrounded 
by minions powerful enough to kill the adventurers . 
The characters can flee and hope to confront the villain 
another day, or they can try to fight their way through 
the minions to take out their target. As a complication , 
the minions might be innocent creatures under the 
villain's controL Killing the villain means breaking that 
control, but the adventurers must endure the minions' 
attacks until they do. 
CREATING A COMBAT ENCOUNTER 
When creating a combat encounter , let your imagination 
run wild and build something your players will enjoy. 
Once you have the details figured out, use this section to 
adjust the difficulty of the encounter. 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES 8T 
COMBAT ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
There are four categories of encounter difficulty. 
Easy. An easy encounter doesn't tax the characters ' 
resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose 
a few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed. 
Medium. A medium encounter usually has one or 
two scary moments for the players, but the characters 
should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or 
more of them might need to use healing resources. 
Hard. A hard encounter could go badly for the 
adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out 
of the fight, and there's a slim chance that one or more 
characters might die. 
Deadly. A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or 
more player characters. Survival often requires good 
tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.

CHALLENGE RATING 
When putting together an encounter or adventure, especially 
at lower levels, exercise caution when using monsters whose 
challenge rating is higher than the party's average level. Such 
a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to 
take out adventurers of a lower level. For example, an ogre 
has a challenge rating of 2, but it can kill a l st-level wizard 
with a single blow. 
In addition, some monsters have features that might be 
difficult or impossible for lower-level characters to overcome. 
For example, a rakshasa has a challenge rating of 13 and is 
immune to spells of 6th level and lower. Spellcasters of 12th 
level or lower have no spells higher than 6th level, meaning 
that they won't be able to affect the rakshasa with their 
magic, putting the adventurers at a serious disadvantage. 
Such an encounter would be significantly tougher for the 
party than the monster's challenge rating might suggest. 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES EVALUATING ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any 
combat encounter. 
1. Determine XP Thresholds. First, determine the 
experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in 
the party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table 
below has four XP thresholds for each character level, 
one for each category of encounter difficulty. Use a 
character 's level to determine his or her XP thresholds. 
Repeat this process for every character in the party. 
2. Determine the Party's XP Threshold. For each 
category of encounter difficulty, add up the characters' 
XP thresholds. This determines the party's XP 
threshold. You'll end up with four totals, one for each 
category of encounter difficulty. 
For example , if your party includes three 3rd-level 
characters and one 2nd-level character, the party's 
totaled XP thresholds would be as follows: 
Easy: 275 XP (75 + 75 + 75 + 50) 
Medium: 550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + l 00) 
Hard: 825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150) 
Deadly: l ,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200) 
Record the totals, because you can use them for every 
encounter in your adventure. 
3. Total the Monsters' XP. Add up the XP for all of 
the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP 
value in its stat block. 
4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters. If the 
encounter includes more than one monster, apply 
a multiplier to the monsters' total XP. The more 
monsters there are, the more attack rolls you're making 
against the characters in a given round, and the more 
dangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge 
an encounter 's difficulty, multiply the total XP of all 
the monsters in the encounter by the value given in the 
Encounter Multipliers table. 
For example, if an encounter includes four monsters 
worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP 
of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. 
This adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth 
in terms of XP; the adjusted value's only purpose is to 
help you accurately assess the encounter's difficulty . 
When making this calculation , don't count any 
monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below 
the average challenge rating of the other monsters in the 
group unless you think the weak monsters significantly 
contribute to the difficulty of the encounter. 
ENCOUNTER MULTIPLIERS 
Number of Number of 
Monsters Multiplier Monsters Multiplier 
X l 7-10 X 2.5 
2 xl.S ll-14 x3 
3-6 x2 15 or more x4 
5. Compare XP. Compare the monsters' adjusted XP 
value to the party's XP thresholds. The closest threshold 
that is lower than the adjusted XP value of the monsters 
determines the encounter's difficulty. 
?or example, an encounter with one bugbear and 
-:~ee hobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, 
-:iling it a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level 
-:aracters and one 2nd-level character (which has 
_ .::.ard encounter threshold of 825 XP and a deadly 
-ounter threshold of 1,400 XP). 
? . .:,.RTY SIZE 
-.::e preceding guidelines assume that you have a party 
:::~sisting of three to five adventurers. 
:; the party contains fewer than three characters, 
-;:;:>ly the next highest multiplier on the Encounter 
~:.Jtipliers table. For example , apply a multiplier of 
_ 5 when the characters fight a single monster, and a 
-uJtiplier of 5 for groups of fifteen or more monsters. 
J the party contains six or more characters, use the 
-::xt lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of 
_ 5 for a single monster . 
. ! -LTIPART ENCOUNTERS 
: Jmetimes an encounter features multiple enemies that 
-:e party doesn't face all at once. For example, c"N<''"' 
-onsters might come at the party in waves. ~,~ 
x§J.~ _,, For such encounters, treat each discrete part or wave as 
a separate encounte r for the purpose of determining its 
difficulty . 
A party can't benefit from a short rest between parts 
of a multipart encounter , so they won't be able to spend 
Hit Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that 
require a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted 
XP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is 
higher than one-third of the party's expected XP total 
for the adventuring day (see "The Adventuring Day," 
below), the encounter is going to be tougher than the 
sum of its parts. 
BUILDING ENCOUNTERS ON A BUDGET 
You can build an encounter if you know its desired 
difficulty . The party's XP thresholds give you an XP 
budget that you can spend on monsters to build easy!. .. 
medium, hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember 
that groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than 
their base XP values would indicate (see step 4). 
For example, using the party from step 2, you can 
build a medium encounter by making sure that the 
adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP 
(the party's threshold for a medium encounter) and 
no more than 825 XP (the party's threshold for a hard 
encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such 
as a manticore or owl bear) is worth 700 XP, so that's 
one possibility. If you want a pair of monsters , each 
one will count for 1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of 
dire wolves (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP 
value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the 
party as well. 
To assist with this approach, appendix B presents a 
list of all monsters in the Monster Manual organized by 
challenge rating. 
THE ADVENTURING DAY 
Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average 
luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six 
to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the 
adventure has more easy encounters , the adventurers 
can get through more. If it has more deadly encounters , 
they can handle fewer. 
In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an 
encounter , you can use the XP values of monsters and 
other opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how 
far the party is likely to progress. 
For each character in the party, use the Adventuring 
Day XP table to estimate how much XP that character is 
expected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all 
party members to get a total for the party's adventuring 
day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP 
value for encounters the party can handle before the 
characters will need to take a long rest.

SHORT RESTS 
In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the 
party will likely need to take two short rests, about one­
third and two-thirds of the way through the day. 
MODIFYING ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
An encounter can be made easier or harder based on 
the choice of location and the situation. 
:ncrease the difficulty of the encounter by one step 
":-am easy to medium, for example) if the characters 
-2.·;e a drawback that their enemies don't. Reduce the

: :-ection. If the characters have both a benefit and a 
::-awback, the two cancel each other out. 
-ituational drawbacks include the following: 
~he whole party is surprised, and the enemy isn't. 
~he enemy has cover, and the party doesn't. 
~he characters are unable to see the enemy. 
-he characters are taking damage every round from 
some environmental effect or magical source, and the 
enemy isn't. 
The characters are hanging from a rope, in the midst 
of scaling a sheer wall or cliff, stuck to the floor, or oth­
erwise in a situation that greatly hinders their mobility 
or makes them sitting ducks. 
ituational benefits are similar to drawbacks except 
'-ar they benefit the characters instead of the enemy. 
.:uN COMBAT ENCOUNTERS 
:-3e following features can add more fun and suspense 
a combat encounter: 
Terrain features that pose inherent risks to both the 
characters and their enemies, such as a frayed rope 
bridge and pools of green slime 
Terrain features that provide a change of elevation, 
uch as pits, stacks of empty crates, ledges, 
and balconies 
Features that either inspire or force characters and 
their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers , 
kegs of gunpowder or oil, and whirling blade traps 
Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive 
positions, so that characters who normally attack at 
range are forced to move around the battlefield 
Different types of monsters working together 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
.~s characters explore a wilderness area or dungeon 
omplex, they are bound to encounter the unexpected . 
i<.andom encounters are a way to deliver the unexpected. 
:hey are usually presented in the form of a table. When 
a random encounter occurs, you roll a die and consult 
<he table to determine what the party encounters. 
Some players and DMs view random encounters in an 
adventure as time-wasters, yet well-designed random 
encounters can serve a variety of useful purposes: 
Create urgency. Adventurers don't tend to dawdle 
if the threat of random encounters is hanging over 
their heads. Wanting to avoid wandering monsters 
creates a strong incentive to look for a safe place to 
rest. (Rolling dice behind the DM screen can often 
accomplish this even without an actual encounter.) 
Establish atmosphere. The appearan ce of 
thematically linked creatures as random encounters 
helps to create a consistent tone and atmosphere 
for an adventure. For example , an encounter table filled with bats, wraiths, giant spiders, and zombies 
creates a sense of horror, and tells the adventurers to 
prepare for battle with even more powerful creatures 
of the night. 
Drain character resources. Random encounters can 
drain the party's hit points and spell slots, leaving the 
adventurers feeling underpowered and vulnerable . 
This creates tension, as players are forced to make 
decisions based on the fact that their characters aren't 
at full strength. 
Provide assistance. Some random encounters can 
benefit the characters instead of hindering or harming 
them. Helpful creatures or NPCs might provide the 
adventurers with useful information or assistance 
when they need it most. 
Add interest. Random encounters can reveal details 
about your world. They can foreshadow danger or 
provide hints that will help the adventurers prepare 
for the encounters to come. 
• Reinforce campaign themes. Random encounters 
can remind the players of the major themes of the 
campaign. For example, if your campaign features an 
ongoing war between two nations, you might design 
random encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present 
nature of the conflict. In friendly territory, your tables 
might include bedraggled troops returning from bat­
tle, refugees fleeing invading forces, heavily guarded 
caravans full of weapons, and lone messengers on 
horseback riding for the front lines. While charac­
ters are in hostile territory, the tables might include 
battlefields littered with the recently slain, armies of 
evil humanoids on the march, and improvised gib­
bets holding the bodies of deserters who tried to flee 
the conflict. 
Random encounters should never be tiresome to you 
or your players. You don't want the players to feel as if 
they aren't making progress because another random 
encounter brings their progress to a halt whenever they 
try to move forward. Likewise , you don't want to spend 
time distracted by random encounters that add nothing 
to the adventure narrative or that interfere with the 
overall pace you're trying to set. 
Not every DM likes to use random encounters . You 
might find that they distract from your game or are 
otherwise causing more trouble than you want. If 
random encounters don't work for you, don't use them. 
TRIGGERING RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
Because you want random encounters to build on the 
intended narrative of a game session, not compete with 
it, you should choose the placement of those encounters 
carefully. Think about a random encounter under any of 
the following circumstances: 
The players are getting off track and slowing 
down the game. 
The characters stop for a short or long rest. 
• The characters are undertaking a long, 
uneventful journey. 
The characters draw attention to themselves when 
they should be keeping a low profile.

CHECKING FOR RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 
You decide when a random encounter happens , or you 
roll. Consider checking for a random encounter once 
every hour, once every 4 to 8 hours, or once during the 
day and once during a long rest-whatev er makes the 
most sense based on how active the area is. 
If you roll, do so with a d20. If the result is 18 or 
higher, a random encounter occurs. You then roll on an 
appropri ate random encounter table to determine what 
the adventur ers meet, rerolling if the die result doesn't 
make sense given the circumstances. 
Random encounter tables might be provided as part 
of the adventure you're running, or you can use the 
information in this chapter to build your own. Creating 
your own tables is the best way to reinforce the themes 
and flavor of your home campaign. 
Not every run-in with another creature counts as 
a random encounter. Encounter tables don't usually 
include rabbits hopping through the undergrowth, 
harmless rats scurrying through dungeon halls, or 
average citizens walking through the streets of a city. 
Random encounter tables present obstacles and events 
that advance the plot, foreshadow important elements or 
themes of the adventure , and provide fun distractions . 
CHAPTER 3 I CREATING ADVENTURES CREATING RANDOM ENCOUNTER TABLES 
Creating your own random encounter tables is 
straightfor ward. Determine what sort of encounters 
might occur in a given dungeon area, figure out the 
likelihood of a particular encounter occurring , then 
arrange the results. An "encounter" in this case could be 
a single monster or NPC, a group of monsters or NPCs, 
a random event (such as an earth tremor or a parade), 
or a random discovery (such as a charred corpse or a 
message scrawled on a wall). 
Assemble Your Encounters. Once you've established 
a location through which the adventurers are likely to 
pass, be it a wilderness area or dungeon complex, make 
a list of creatures that might be found wandering there. 
If you're not sure which creatures to include, appendix B 
has lists of monsters organized by terrain type. 
For a sylvan woodland, you might create a table 
that includes centaurs, faerie dragons, pixies, sprites, 
dryads, satyrs, blink dogs, elks, owlbears, treants, giant 
owls, and a unicorn. If elves inhabit the forest, the table 
might also include elf druids and elf scouts. Perhaps 
gnolls are threatening the woods, so adding gnolls and 
hyenas to the table would be a fun surprise for players. 
Another fun surprise would be a wandering predator, 
such as a displacer beast that likes to hunt blink dogs. 
The table could also use a few random encounters of 
a less monstrous nature, such as a grove of burned 
trees (the handiwork of the gnolls), an ivy-covered 
elven statue, and a plant with glowing berries that turn 
creatures invisible when ingested . 
When choosing monsters for a random encounter 
table, try to imagine why the monsters would be 
encountered outside their lairs. What is each monster 
up to? Is it on patrol? Hunting for food? Searching for 
something? Also consider whether a creature is moving 
stealthily as it travels through the area. 
As with planned encounters, random encounters 
are more interesting when they happen in memorable 
locations . Outdoors the adventurers might be crossing 
a forest clearing when they encounter a unicorn or 
be pushing through a dense section of forest when 
they come across a nest of spiders. Crossing a desert, 
characters might discover an oasis haunted by wights or 
a rocky outcropping on which a blue dragon perches. 
Probabilities. A random encounter table can be 
created in a number of ways, ranging from simple (roll 
ld6 for one of six possible encounters) to complicated 
(roll percentile dice, modify for time of day, and cross­
index the modified number with the dungeon level). The 
sample encounter table presented here uses a range of 
2 to 20 (nineteen entries total), generated using 1d12 
+ 1d8. The probability curve ensures that encounters 
appearing in the middle of the table are more likely to 
occur than encounters placed at the beginning or end 
of the table. A roll of 2 or 20 is rare (about a 1 percent 
chance of either), while each of the rolls from 9 to 13 
occurs a little over 8 percent of the time. 
The Sylvan Forest Encounters table is an example 
of a random encounter table that implements the ideas 
mentioned above. Creature names in bold refer to stat 
blocks that appear in the Monster Manual.

RANDOM ENCOUNTER CHALLENGE 
Random encounters need not be level-appropriate 
challenges for the adventurers , but it's considered bad 
form to slaughter a party using a random encounter, 
since most players consider this ending to be an 
unsatisfying one. 
Not all random encounters with monsters need 
to be resolved through combat. A 1st-level party of 
adventurers could have a random encounter with a 
young dragon circling above a forest canopy in search 
of a quick meal, but the characters should have the 
option to hide or bargain for their lives if the dragon 
spots them. Similarly, the party might encounter a stone 
giant roaming the hills, but it might have no intention 
of harming anyone. In fact, it might shy away from the 
party because of its reclusive nature. The giant might 
attack only characters who annoy it. 
That said, a random encounter table usually includes 
hostile (though not necessarily evil) monsters that 
are meant to be fought. The following monsters are 
considered appropriate combat challenges : 
• A single monster with a challenge rating equal to or 
lower than the party's level. 
A group of monsters whose adjusted XP value consti­
tutes an easy, medium, or hard challenge for the party, 
as determined using the encounter-building guide­
lines earlier in this chapter.

it is indifferent and doesn't announce its 
presence as the characters pass by.

CHAPTER 4: CREATING NONPLAYER CHARACTERS 
NONPLAYER CHARACTER IS ANY CHARA CTER 
controlled by the Dungeon Master. NPCs can 
be enemies or allies, regular folk or named 
monsters. They include the local innkeeper , 
the old wizard who lives in the tower on the 
outskirts of town, the death knight out to 
destroy the kingdom , and the dragon counting gold in its 
cavernous lair. 
This chapter shows you how to flesh out non player 
characters for your game. For guidelines on generating 
monster-like stat blocks for an NPC, see chapter 9, 
-Dungeon Master's Workshop. " 
DESIGNING NPCs 
_ ·othing brings your adventures and campaigns to life 
better than a cast of well-developed NPCs. That said, 
_ 'PCs in your game rarely need as much complexity 
a a well-crafted character in a novel or movie. Most 
_ 'PCs are bit players in the campaign , whereas the 
adventurers are the stars. 
QuicK NPCs 
An NPC doesn't need combat statistics unless it poses 
a rhreat. Moreover, most NPCs need only one or two 
qualities to make them memorable. For example, 
:our players will have no trouble remembering the 
no-nonsense blacksmith with the tattoo of the black rose 
on his right shoulder or the badly dressed bard with the 
broken nose. 
DETAILED NPCs 
For NPCs who play larger roles in your adventures, 
allow more time to flesh out their histories and 
personalities. As you'll see, ten sentences can sum up 
he main elements of a memorable NPC, one sentence 
·or each of the following: 
Occupation and history 
Appearance 
Abilities 
Talent 
Mannerism 
Interactions with others 
Useful knowledge 
Ideal 
Bond 
Flaw or secret 
Although the material here focuses on humanoid 
_·pes, you can adjust details to create monstrous 
_ 'PCs as well. 
OCCUPATION AND HISTORY 
In one sentence, describe the NPC's occupation 
and provide a brief historical note that hints at the 
character's past. For example, the NPC might have 
-erved in an army, been imprisoned for a crime, or 
adventured years ago. APPEARANCE 
In one sentence, describe the NPC's most distinctive 
physical features. You can roll on the NPC Appearance 
table or choose a feature that suits the character.

note abilities that are above or below average-great 
strength or monumental stupidity , for example-and use 
them to inform the NPC's qualities .

CHAPTER 4 J CREATING NONPLAYER CHARACTERS INTERAC TIONS WITH OTHERS 
In one sentence, describe how the NPC interacts 
with others, using the NPC Interaction Traits table if 
necessary. An NPC's behavior can change depending 
on who he or she is interacting with. For example, an 
innkeeper might be friendly toward guests and rude to 
her staff. 
NPC INTERACTION TRAITS

6 Friendly 12 Suspicious 
USEFUL KNOWLEDGE 
In a sentence , describe one bit of knowledge the NPC 
possesses that might be of use to the player characters. 
The NPC might know something as banal as the 
best inn in town or as important as a clue needed to 
solve a murder. 
IDEAL 
In a sentence , describe one ideal that the NPC holds 
dear and which governs his or her greater actions. 
Player characters who uncover an NPC's ideal can 
use what they've learned to influence the NPC in a 
social interaction (as discussed in chapter 8, "Running 
the Game'} 
Ideals can connect to alignment, as shown on the 
NPC Ideals table. The alignment connections here are 
suggestions only; an evil character could have beauty as 
an ideal, for instance.

BOND 
In a sentence, summarize the people, places, or things 
that are especially important to the NPC. The NPC 
Bonds table offers suggestions in broad categories. 
The character backgrounds in the Player's Handbook 
explore bonds in more detail, and player characters who 
uncover an NPC's bond can use what they've learned to 
influence the NPC in a social interaction (as discussed 
in chapter 8). 
NPC BONDS

FLAW OR SECRET 
In one sentence , describe the NPC's flaw-some 
element of the character's personality or history that 
could potentially undermine the character-or a secret 
that the NPC is trying to hide. 
The NPC Flaws and Secrets table provides several 
ideas. The backgrounds in the Player's Handbook 
can be used to create more detailed flaws. Player 
characters who uncover an NPC's flaw or secret can use 
what they've learned to influence the NPC in a social 
interaction (as discussed in chapter 8).

MoNsTERS As NPCs 
_ amed monsters that play a significant role in an 
adventure deserve the same attention you would give to 
a humanoid NPC, with mannerisms as well as ideals, 
bonds, flaws, and secrets. If a beholder mastermind 
is behind the criminal activities in a city, don't rely 
olely on the entry in the Monster Manual to describe 
the creature's appearance and personality. Take the 
time to give it a bit of background , a distinctive quirk of 
appearance , and especially an ideal, a bond, and a flaw. 
As an example, consider the Xanathar, a beholder 
that runs extensive criminal operations in the city of 
Waterdeep. The Xanathar's spherical body is covered in 
leathery flesh with a texture similar to cobblestones. Its 
eyes talks are jointed like the legs of an insect, and some 
of the stalks have magic rings on them. The Xanathar's 
speech is slow and deliberate , and it prefers to turn its 
central eye away from creatures it speaks to. Like all 
beholders , it sees other creatures as inferiors, though 
it understands the usefulness of its humanoid minions. 
The Xanathar uses the sewers beneath Waterdeep to 
access virtually any location within or under the city. 
The Xanathar's ideal is greed. It craves powerful 
magic items and surrounds itself with gold, platinum, 
and precious gems. Its bond is to its lair-an elaborate 
cavern complex carved out between the twisting sewers 
ofWaterdeep, which it inherited from its predecessors 
and cherishes above all else. Its flaw is a weakness for 
exotic pleasures: finely prepared foods, scented oils, and 
rare spices and herbs. 
Establishing this information allows you to play the 
Xanathar as more than an ordinary beholder. The 
complexities of the creature's characterization create 
more memorable interaction and interesting story 
possibilities. 
NPC STATISTICS 
When you give an NPC game statistics , you have three 
main options: giving the NPC only the few statistics it 
needs, give the NPC a monster stat block, or give the 
NPC a class and levels. The latter two options require a 
bit of explanation . 
/ USING A MONSTER S-TAT BLOCK 
Appendix B of the l}f-<:fnster Manual contains statistics 
for many gen~;pe-i"fPCs that you can customize as you 
ee-fit;"affi!Chapter 9 of this book offers guidelines on 
adjusting their statistics and creating a new stat block. USING CLASSES AND LEVELS 
You can create an NPC just as you would a player 
character , using the rules in the Player's Handbook. 
You can even use a character sheet to keep track of the 
NPC's vital information. 
Class Options. In addition to the class options in the 
Player's Handbook , two additional class options are 
available for evil player characters and NPCs: the Dea ._ 
domain for clerics and the oathbreaker for paladins. 
Both options are detailed at the end of this chapter. 
Equipment. Most NPCs don't need an exhaustive lis 
of equipment. An enemy meant to be faced in combat 
requires weapons and armor, plus any treasure the 
NPC carries (including magic items that might be used 
against the adventurers). 
Challenge Rating. An NPC built for combat needs a 
challenge rating. Use the rules in chapter 9 to determin 
the NPC's challenge rating, just as you would for a 
monster you designed. 
NPC PARTY MEMBERS 
NPCs might join the adventuring party because they 
want a share of the loot and are willing to accept 
an equal share of the risk, or they might follow the 
adventurers because of a bond of loyalty, gratitude, 
or love. Such NPCs are controlled by you, or you 
can transfer control to the players. Even if a player 
controls an NPC, it's up to you to make sure the NPC i 
portrayed as a character in his or her own right, not jus· 
as a servant that the players can manipulate for their 
own benefit. 
Any NPC that accompanies the adventurers acts as 
a party member and earns a full share of experience 
points. When determining the difficulty of a combat 
encounter (see chapter 3), make sure to include all NPC 
party members. 
Low-LEVEL FoLLOWERS 
Your campaign might allow player characters to take on 
lower-level NPCs as followers. For example, a paladin 
might have a 1st-level paladin as a squire, a wizard 
might accept a 2nd-level wizard as an apprentice, a 
cleric might choose (or be assigned) a 3rd-level cleric as 
an acolyte, and a bard might take on a 4th-level bard as 
an understudy. 
One advantage of allowing lower-level characters to 
join the party is that players have backup characters if 
their main characters take time off, retire, or die. One 
disadvantage is that you and your players have more 
party members to account for. 
Since lower-level NPC party members receive equal 
party shares of XP, they will gain levels more quickly 
than the adventurers (the benefit of studying under such 
experienced masters), and might eventually catch up to 
them. It also means the adventurers ' advancement is 
slowed somewhat , as they must share their XP with an 
NPC shouldering only part of the adventuring burden. 
Powerful monsters that are an appropriate challenge 
for higher-level characters can deal enough damage to 
instantly kill or incapacitate a low-level follower. The 
adventurers should expect to spend effort and resources 
protecting lower-level NPC party members and to 
provide healing when this protection fails. 
ADVENTURER NPCs 
If you don't have enough players to form a full party, 
;·ou can use NPCs to fill out the ranks. These NPCs 
-hould be the same level as the lowest-level adventurer 
in the party and built (either by you or your players) 
using the character creation and advancement rules in 
the Player's Handbook . It's easiest on you if you let the 
players create and run these supporting characters. 
Encourage players to roleplay supporting characters 
a true to the NPCs' personality traits, ideals, bonds, 
and flaws as possible, so that they don't come across 
automatons. If you don't feel that an NPC is being 
portrayed well, you can take control of the NPC, give 
i to another player, or simply have the NPC leave 
~e party. 
J PC supporting characters are easier to play if you 
imit their class options. Good candidates for supporting 
characters include a cleric with the Life domain, a 
-ghter with the Champion archetype, a rogue with the 
-hief archetype , and a wizard specializing in Evocation . 
OPTIONAL RULE: LOYALTY 
_oyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine 
· ow far an NPC party member will go to protect or 
--sist the other members of the party (even those 
she doesn't particularly like). An NPC party 
·ho is abused or ignored is likely to abandon 
- e party, whereas an NPC who owes a life 
haracters or shares their goals might fight to the death 
:or them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or represented by 
this rule. 
:..oYALTY ScoRE 
_.\n PC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 
to 20. The NPC's maximum loyalty score is equal 
-o the highest Charisma score among all adventurers 
the party, and its starting loyalty score is half that 
umber. If the highest Charisma score changes­
;x:rhaps a character dies or leaves the group-adjust the 
-PC's loyalty score accordingly. 
TRACKING LOYALTY 
'eep track of an NPC's loyalty score in secret so that 
- e players won't know for sure whether an NPC party 
~ember is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently 
:mder a player's control). 
An NPC's loyalty score increases by ld4 if other party 
embers help the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond. 
:... -·ewise, an NPC's loyalty score increases by ld4 if 
-· e PC is treated particularly well (for example, given 
a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party 
member. An NPC's loyalty score can never be raised 
above its maximum . 
When other party members act in a manner that 
;-uns counter to the NPC's alignment or bond, reduce 
-he PC's loyalty score by ld4. Reduce the NPC's 
nyalty score by 2d4 if the character is abused, misled, 
r endangered by other party members for purely 
: !fish reasons. An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer 
loyal to the party and might part ways with them. A 
loyalty score can never drop below 0. 
An NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life 
and limb to help fellow party members. If the NPC's 
loyalty score is between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous. 
An NPC whose loyalty drops to 0 no longer acts in the 
party's best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the 
party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or 
works in secret to bring about the party's downfall. 
CONTACTS 
Contacts are NPCs with close ties to one or more of 
the player characters. They don't go on adventures, 
but they can provide information , rumors, supplies, or 
professional advice, either for free or at a cost. Some 
of the backgrounds in the Player's Handbook suggest 
CHAPTER 4 CREATING NONPLAYER CHARACTERS 
93 
94 contacts for beginning adventurers , and characters are 
likely to secure more helpful contacts over the course of 
their adventuring careers. 
A name and a few choice details are all you need 
for casual contacts, but take the time to flesh out a 
recurring contact, especially one who might become an 
ally or enemy at some point. At the very least, give some 
thought to a contact's goals and how those goals are 
likely to come into play. 
PATRONS 
A patron is a contact who employs the adventurers , 
providing help or rewards as well as quests and 
adventure hooks. Most of the time, a patron has a vested 
interest in the adventurers' success and doesn't need to 
be persuaded to help them. 
A patron might be a retired adventurer who seeks 
younger heroes to deal with rising threats, or a mayor 
who knows that the town guard can't handle a dragon 
demanding tribute. A sheriff becomes a patron by 
offering a bounty for kobold raiders terrorizing the local 
countryside , as does a noble who wants an abandoned 
estate cleared of monsters. 
HIRELINGS 
Adventurers can pay NPCs to provide services 
in a variety of circumstances. Information on 
hirelings appears in chapter 5, "Equipment ," of the 
Player's Handbook. 
Hireling NPCs rarely become important in an 
adventure, and most require little development. When 
adventurers hire a coach to carry them across town 
or need a letter delivered, the driver or messenger 
is a hireling, and the adventurers might never even 
converse with that NPC or learn his or her name. A 
ship captain carrying the adventurers across the sea is 
also a hireling, but such a character has the potential 
to turn into an ally, a patron, or even an enemy as the 
adventure unfolds. 
When the adventurers hire an NPC for long-term 
work, add the cost of that NPC's services to the 
characters ' lifestyle expenses. See the "Additional 
Expenses " section of chapter 6, "Between Adventures ," 
for more information. 
ExTRAS 
Extras are the characters and creatures in the 
background that the main characters rarely, if ever, 
interact with. 
Extras might be elevated to more important roles by 
virtue of adventurers singling them out. For instance, a 
player might be hooked by a passing reference you make 
to a street urchin and try to strike up a conversation 
with the youngster. Suddenly , an extra on whom you 
placed no importance becomes a central figure in an

VILLAIN 's SECRET WEAKNESS 
Finding and exploiting a villain's weakness can be 
very gratifying for players, although a smart villain 
tries to conceal its weakness. A lich, for example, has 
a phylactery -a magical receptacle for its soul-that it 
keeps well hidden. Only by destroying the phylactery 
can the characters ensure the lich's destruction. 
CHAPTER 4 I CREATING NQ,"PLAYER CHARACTERS Weakness 
A hidden object holds the villain's soul. 
The villain's power is broken if the# death of its true 
love is avenged. 
3 The villain is weakened in the presence of a 
particular artifact. 
4 A special weapon deals extra damage when used 
against the villain. 
5 The villain is destroyed if it speaks its true name. 
6 An ancient prophecy or riddle reveals how the 
villain can be overthrown. 
7 The villain falls when an ancient enemy forgives its 
past actions. 
8 The villain loses its power if a mystic bargain it 
struck long ago is completed. 
VILLAINOUS 
CLASS OPTIONS 
You can use the rules in the Player's Handbook to create 
NPCs with classes and levels, the same way you create 
player characters . The class options below let you create 
two specific villainous archetypes: the evil high priest 
and the evil knight or anti paladin. 
The Death Domain is an additional domain choice for 
evil clerics, and the Oathbreaker offers an alternative 
path for paladins who fall from grace. A player can 
choose one of these options with the your approval. 
CLERIC : DEATH DOMAIN 
The Death domain is concerned with the forces that 
cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives 
rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh , 
Myrkul, and WeeJas are patrons of necromancers, 
death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. 
Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubi . 
Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar) , disease 
or poison (Incabulos , Talona, or Morgion), and the 
underworld (Hades and He!). 
DEATH DOMAIN SPELLS 
Cleric Level Spells 
l st false life, ray of sickness 
3rd blindnessjdeafness, ray of enfeeblement 
5th animate dead, vampiric touch 
7th blight, death ward 
9th anti life shell, cloud kill 
BONUS PROFICIENCY 
When the cleric chooses this domain at 1st level, he or 
she gains proficiency with martial weapons. 
REAPER 
At 1st level, the cleric learns one necromancy cantrip 
of his or her choice from any spell list. When the cleric 
casts a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only 
one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures 
within range and within 5 feet of each other. 
HANNEL DIVINITY : TOUCH OF DEATH 
:illrting at 2nd level, the cleric can use Channel Divinity 
destroy another creature 's life force by touch. 
.\"hen the cleric hits a creature with a melee attack, 
-e cleric can use Channel Divinity to deal extra 
rotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + 
· ce his or her cleric level. 
~_;ESCAPABLE DESTRUCTION 
:::!:afting at 6th level, the cleric's ability to channel 
--gative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage 
:. alt by the character's cleric spells and Channel 
_ inity options ignores resistance to necrotic damage. 
..... rviNE STRIKE 
--th level, the cleric gains the ability to infuse his or 
weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each 
~the cleric's turns when he or she hits a creature with a 
eapon attack, the cleric can cause the attack to deal an 
a 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When the cleric 
-eaches 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. 
= PROVED REAPER 
:<arting at 17th level, when the cleric casts a 
-cromancy spell of 1st through 5th level that targets 
illy one creature, the spell can instead target two 
::-eatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If 
-e spell consumes its material components , the cleric 
::ru t provide them for each target. 
?_-\.LADIN: 0ATHBREAKER 
.:1 Oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks his or her 
: cred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an 
~power. Whatever light burned in the paladin's heart 
been extinguished. Only darkness remains . 
A paladin must be evil and at least 3rd level to 
~come an Oathbreaker. The paladin replaces the 
:earures specific to his or her Sacred Oath with 
athbreaker features. 
0ATHBREAKER SPELLS 
_-..n Oathbreaker paladin loses previously gained oath 
spells and instead gains the following Oathbreaker 
spells at the paladin levels listed.

CHANNEL DIVINITY 
An Oathbreaker paladin of 3rd level or higher gains the 
:ollowing two Channel Divinity options. 
Control Undead. As an action, the paladin targets one 
ndead creature he or she can see within 30 feet of him 
or her. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. 
On a failed save, the target must obey the paladin's 
commands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin uses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead 
whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than the 
paladin's level is immune to this effect. 
Dreadful Aspect. As an action, the paladin channels 
the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of 
magical menace. Each creature of the paladin's choice 
within 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom 
saving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save, 
the target is frightened of the paladin for 1 minute. If a 
creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 
30 feet away from the paladin, it can attempt another 
Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it. 
AURA OF HATE 
Starting at 7th level, the paladin, as well any fiends and 
undead within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a bonus 
to melee weapon damage rolls equal to the paladin's 
Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can 
benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time. 
f\t 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. 
SUPERNATURAL RESISTANCE 
At 15th level, the paladin gains resistance to 
bludgeoning , piercing, and slashing damage from 
nonmagical weapons. 
DREAD LORD 
At 20th-level , the paladin can, as an action, surround 
himself or herself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 
minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot 
radius around the paladin to dim light. Whenever an 
enemy that is frightened by the paladin starts its turn 
in the aura, it takes 4dl0 psychic damage. Additionally , 
the paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the aura 
are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on 
sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures 
draped in this shadow. 
While the aura lasts, the paladin can use a bonus 
action on his or her turn to cause the shadows in the 
aura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a 
melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, 
the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 +.the 
paladin's Charisma modifier. 
After activating the aura, the paladin can't do so again 
until he or she finishes a long rest. 
0ATHBREAKER ATONEMENT 
If you allow a player to choose the Oath breaker option, 
you can later allow the paladin to atone and become a true 
paladin once more. 
The paladin who wishes to atone must first shed his or 
her evil alignment and demonstrate this alignment change 
through words and deeds. Having done so, the paladin 
loses all Oath breaker features and must choose a deity 
and a sacred oath. (With your permission , the player can 
select a different deity or sacred oath than the character 
had previously.) However, the paladin doesn't gain the 
class features specific to that sacred oath until he or 
she completes some kind of dangerous quest or trial, as 
determined by the DM. 
A paladin who breaks his or her sacred oath a second time 
can become an oath breaker once more, but can't atone.

CHAPTER 5: ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS 
ANY D&D ADVENTURES REVOLVE 
around a dungeon setting. Dungeons 
in D&D include great halls and tombs, 
subterranean monster lairs, labyrinths 
riddled with death traps, natural 
caverns extending for miles beneath the 
-urface of the world, and ruined castles. 
. ot every adventure takes place in a dungeon. A 
:ilderness trek across the Desert of Desolation or a 
arrowing journey into the jungles of the Isle of Dread 
can be an exciting adventure in its own right. In the 
great outdoors , dragons wheel across the sky in search 
f prey, tribes of hobgoblins pour forth from their grim 
·ortresses to wage war against their neighbors, ogres 
plunder farmsteads for food, and monstrous spiders 
op from the web-shrouded canopies of trees. 
Within a dungeon , adventurers are constrained by 
:ails and doors around them, but in the wilderness, 
adventurers can travel in almost any direction they 
please. Therein lies the key differenc e between dungeon 
and wilderness: it's much easier to predict where the 
adventuring party might go in the dungeon because the 
ptions are limited-less so in the wilderness. 
illages, towns, and cities are cradles of civilization 
n a dangerous world, but they too offer opportunities 
· r adventure . Encounters with monsters ·might seem 
Jlllikely within a city's walls, but urban settings have 
· eir own villains and perils. Evil, after all, takes many 
·orms, and urban settings aren't always the safe havens 
.hey seem to be. 
This chapter provides an overview of these three 
environments plus a few unusual environments, taking 
:-ou through the process of creating an adventure 
ocation, with plenty of random tables to inspire you. 
DUNGEONS 
-me dungeons are old strongholds abandoned by the 
• lk who built them. Others are natural caves or weird 
..airs carved out by foul monsters. They attract evil cults, 
onster tribes, and reclusive creatures . Dungeons are 
o home to ancient treasures: coins, gems, magic

DUNGEON CREATOR 
A dungeon reflects its creators. A lost temple of the 
yuan-ti, choked by overgrown jungle plants, might 
feature ramps instead of stairs. Caverns carved by a

beholder·s disintegration eye ray have walls that are 
unnaturally smooth, and the beholder's lair might 
include vertical shafts connecting different levels. 
Amphibious monsters such as kuo-toa and aboleths use 
water to protect the innermost reaches of their lairs 
from air-breathing intruders. 
Details bring a dungeon setting's personality to life. 
Great bearded faces might be carved on the doors of a 
dwarven stronghold and might be defaced by the gnolls 
who live there now. Spiderweb decorations, torture 
chambers, and slave pens might be common features 
in a vault built by drow, telling something about that 
location and its occupants . 
The Dungeon Creator table includes creatures that 
typically build dungeons . You can choose a creator 
from the table or roll randomly, or choose some other 
dungeon builder appropriate for your campaign.

DUNGEON PURPOSE 
Except in the case of a natural cavern, a dungeon 
· crafted and inhabited for a specific purpose that 
influences its design and features. You can choose a 
purpose from the Dungeon Purpose table, roll one at 
;--andom, or use your own ideas.

10 Planar gate 
Death Trap. This dungeon is built to eliminate any 
creature that dares to enter it. A death trap might guard 
the treasure of an insane wizard, or it might be designed 
o lure adventurers to their demise for some nefarious 
purpose, such as to feed souls to a lich's phylactery. 
Lair. A lair is a place where monsters live. Typical 
airs include ruins and caves. 
Maze. A maze is intended to deceive oi-confuse 
those who enter it. Some mazes are elaborate obstacles 
that protect treasure, while others are gauntlets for 
prisoners banished there to be hunted and devoured by 
the monsters within. 
Mine. An abandoned mine can quickly become 
infested with monsters , while miners who delve too 
deep can break through into the Underdark. 
Planar Gate. Dungeons built around planar portals 
are often transformed by the planar energy seeping out 
through those portals. 
Stronghold. A stronghold dungeon provides a secure 
base of operations for villains and monsters . It is 
ually ruled by a powerful individual , such as a wizard, 
·:ampire, or dragon, and it is larger and more complex 
ilian a simple lair. 
Temple or Shrine. This dungeon is consecrated to 
a deity or other planar entity. The entity's worshipers 
control the dungeon and conduct their rites there. 
Tomb. Tombs are magnets for treasure hunters, as 
well as monsters that hunger for the bones of the dead. 
Treasure Vault. Built to protect powerful magic items 
and great material wealth, treasure vault dungeons are 
: eavily guarded by monsters and traps. 
HISTORY 
n most cases, the original architects of a dungeon are 
ong gone, and the question of what happened to them 
can help shape the dungeon's current state. The Dungeon History table notes key events that 
can transform a site from its original purpose into a 
dungeon for adventurers to explore. Particularly old 
dungeons can have a history that consists of multiple 
events, each of which transformed the site in some way.

DUNGEON INHABITANTS 
After a dungeon's creators depart, anyone or anything 
might move in. Intelligent monsters , mindless dungeon 
scavengers, predators and prey alike can be drawn 
to dungeons. 
The monsters in a dungeon are more than a 
collection of random creatures that happen to live 
near one another. Fungi, vermin, scavengers, and 
predators can coexist in a complex ecology, alongside 
intelligent creatures who share living space through 
elaborate combinations of domination, negotiation, and 
bloodshed. 
Characters might be able to sneak into a dungeon, 
ally with one faction, or play factions against each other 
to reduce the threat of the more powerful monsters. 
For example, in a dungeon inhabited by mind !layers 
and their goblinoid thralls, the adventurers might try 
to incite the goblins, hobgoblins , and bugbears to revolt 
against their illithid masters. 
DUNGEON FACTIONS 
A dungeon is sometimes dominated by a single group 
of intelligent humanoids , whether a tribe of orcs 
that have taken over a cavern complex or a gang of 
trolls inhabiting an aboveground ruin. Other times, 
particularly in larger dungeons , multiple groups of 
creatures share space and compete for resources. 
For example, orcs that dwell in the mines of a ruined 
dwarf citadel might skirmish constantly against the 
hobgoblins that hold the citadel's upper tiers. Mind 
!layers that have established a colony in the lowest 
levels of the mines could manipulate and dominate key 
hobgoblins in an attempt to wipe out the orcs. And all 
the while, a hidden cell of drow scouts watches and 
plots to slay the mind !layers, then enslave whatever 
creatures are left. 
It's easy to think of a dungeon as a collection of 
encounter s, with the adventurers kicking down door 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVTRONMENTS 101 
102 after door and killing whatever lies beyond. But the 
ebb and flow of power between groups in a dungeon 
provides plenty of opportunities for more subtle 
interaction. Dungeon denizens are used to striking 
unlikely alliances, and adventurers are a wild card that 
canny monsters seek to exploit. 
Intelligent creatures in a dungeon have goals, whether 
as simple as short-term survival or as ambitious 
as claiming the entire dungeon as the first step in 
founding an empire. Such creatures might approach 
adventurers with an offer of alliance, hoping to prevent 
the characters from laying waste to their lair and to 
secure aid against their enemies. Bring the NPC leaders 
of such groups to life as described in chapter 4, fleshing 
out their personalities , goals, and ideals. Then use 
those elements to shape a response to the arrival of 
adventurers in their territory. 
DUNGEON ECOLOGY 
An inhabited dungeon has its own ecosystem. The 
creatures that live there need to eat, drink, breathe, and 
sleep, just as creatures in the wilderness do. Predators 
need to be able to seek prey, and intelligent creatures 
search for lairs offering the best combination of air, 
food, water, and security. Keep these factors in mind 
when designing a dungeon you want the players to 
believe in. If a dungeon doesn't have some internal logic 
to it, adventurers will find it difficult to make reasonabl e 
decisions within that environment. 
For example, characters who find a pool of fresh water 
in a dungeon might make the logical assumption that 
many of the creatures inhabiting the dungeon come to 
that spot to drink. The adventurers might set an ambush 
at the pool. Likewise , locked doors-or even doors that 
require hands to open-can restrict the movement of 
some creatures. If all the doors in a dungeon are closed, 
the players might wonder how the carrion crawlers or 
stirges they repeatedly encounter manage to survive. 
ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
You might be inclined to increase the encounter 
difficulty as the adventurers descend deeper into the 
dungeon, as a way to keep the dungeon challenging as 
the characters gain levels or to ratchet up the tension. 
However, this approach can turn the dungeon into a 
grind. A better approach is to include encountets of 
varying difficulty throughout. The contrast between easy 
and hard encounters, as well as simple and complex 
encounters, encourages characters to vary their tactics 
and keeps the encounters from seeming too similar. 
MAPPING A DUNGEON 
Every dungeon needs a map showing its layout. 
The dungeon's location, creator, purpose, history, 
and inhabitants should give you a starting point for 
designing your dungeon map. If you need further 
inspiration , you can find maps that have been made 
freely available for use on the Internet, or even use a 
map of a real-world location. Alternatively, you can 
borrow a map from a published adventure or randomly 
generate a dungeon complex using the tables presented 
in appendix A. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVlRONMENTS A dungeon can range in size from a few chambers 
in a ruined temple to a huge complex of rooms and 
passages extending hundreds of feet in all directions . 
The adventurers' goal often lies as far from the dungeon 
entrance as possible, forcing characters to delve 
deeper underground or push farther into the heart of 
the complex. 
A dungeon is most easily mapped on graph paper, 
with each square on the paper representing an area of 
10 feet by 10 feet. (If you play with miniatur es on a grid, 
you might prefer a scale where each square represents 5 
feet, or you can subdivide your 10-foot grid into a 5-foot 
grid when you draw your maps for combat.) When you 
draw your map, keep the following points in mind: 
Asymmetrical rooms and map layouts make a 
dungeon less predictable. 
Think in three dimensions. Stairs, ramps, platforms , 
ledges, balconies , pits, and other changes of elevation 
make a dungeon more interesting and make combat 
encounters in those areas more challenging. 
• Give the dungeon some wear and tear. Unless you 
want to stress that the dungeon's builders were 
extraordinarily skillful, collapsed passages can be 
commonplace , cutting off formerly connected sections 
of the dungeon from each other. Past earthquak es 
might have opened chasms within a dungeon, splitting 
rooms and corridors to make interesting obstacles. 
Incorporate natural features into even a construct ed 
dungeon. An underground stream might run through 
the middle of a dwarven stronghold, causing variation 
in the shapes and sizes of rooms and necessitating 
features such as bridges and drains. 
• Add multiple entrances and exits. Nothing gives the 
players a stronger sense of making real decisions than 
having multiple ways to enter a dungeon. 
Add secret doors and secret rooms to reward players 
who take.the time to search for them. 
If you need help creating a dungeon map from scratch, 
see appendix A. 
DUNGEON FEATURES 
The atmosphere and physical characteristics of 
dungeons vary as widely as their origins. An old crypt 
might have stone walls and loose wooden doors, an odor 
of decay, and no light other than what adventurers bring 
with them. A volcanic lair might have smooth stone 
walls hollowed out by past eruptions , doors of magically 
reinforced brass, a smell of sulfur, and light provided by 
jets of flame in every hall and room. 
WALLS 
Some dungeons have walls of masonry. Others have 
walls of solid rock, hewn with tools to give them a 
rough, chiseled look, or worn smooth by the passage of 
water or lava. An aboveground dungeon might be made 
of wood or composite materials. 
Walls are sometim es adorned with murals, frescoes, 
bas-reliefs, and lighting fixtures such as sconces or 
torch brackets. A few even have secret doors built 
into them. 
CATACOMBS 
DOORS 
Dungeon doorways might be set within plain arches 
and lintels. They might be festooned with carvings of 
gargoyles or leering faces or engraved with sigils that 
reveal clues as to what lies beyond. 
Stuck Doors. Dungeon doors often become stuck 
when not used frequently. Opening a stuck door requires 
a successful Strength check. Chapter 8, "Running the 
Game," provides guidelines for setting the DC. 
Locked Doors. Characters who don't have the key 
ro a locked door can pick the lock with a successful 
Dexterity check (doing so requires thieves' tools and 
proficiency in their use). They can also force the door 
with a successful Strength check, smash the door to 
pieces by dealing enough damage to it, or use a knock 
spell or similar magic. Chapter 8 provides guidelines • 
for setting the DCs and assigning statistics to doors and other objects. 
Barred Doors. A barred door is similar to a locked 
door, except that there's no lock to pick, and the door 
can be opened normally from the barred side by using 
an action to lift the bar from its braces. 
SECRET DOORS 
A secret door is crafted to blend into the wall that 
surrounds it. Sometimes faint cracks in the wall or scuff 
marks on the floor betray the secret door's presence. 
Detecting a Secret Door. Use the characters' 
passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to determine 
whether anyone in the party notices a secret door 
without actively searching for it. Characters can also 
find a secret door by actively searching the location 
where the door is hidden and succeeding on a Wisdom 
CHAPTER 5 j ADVENTURE ENVfRONMENTS 
104 (Perception) check. To set an appropriate DC for the 
check, see chapter 8. 
Opening a Secret Door. Once a secret door is 
detected, a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check 
might be required to determine how to open it if the 
opening mechanism isn't obvious. Set the DC according 
to the difficulty guidelines in chapter 8. 
If adventurers can't determine how to open a secret 
door, breaking it down is always an option. Treat it 
as a locked door made of the same material as the 
surrounding wall, and use the guidelines in chapter 8 to 
determine appropriate DCs or statistics. 
CoNCEALED DooRs 
A concealed door is a normal door that is hidden from 
view. A secret door is carefully crafted to blend into its 
surrounding surface, whereas a concealed door is most 
often hidden by mundane means. It might be covered 
by a tapestry, covered with plaster, or (in the case of 
a concealed trapdoor) hidden under a rug. Normally, 
no ability check is required to find a concealed door. A 
character need only look in the right place or take the 
right steps to reveal the door. However, you can use 
the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVTRONMENTS determin ·e whether any of them notices tracks or signs 
of a tapestry or rug having been recently disturbed. 
PORTCULLISES 
A portcullis is a set of vertical bars made of wood or 
iron, reinforced with one or more horizontal bands. It 
blocks a passage or archway until it is raised up into 
the ceiling by a winch and chain. The main benefit of a 
portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing 
guards to watch the area beyond and make ranged 
attacks or cast spells through it. 
Winching a portcullis up or down requires an action. 
If a character can't reach the winch (usually because it is 
on the other side of the portcullis) , lifting the portcullis 
or bending its bars far enough apart to pass through 
them requires a successfu l Strength check. The DC 
of the check depends on the size and weight of the 
portcullis or the thickness of its bars. To determine an 
appropriate DC, see chapter 8. 
DARKNESS AND LIGHT 
Darkness is the default condition inside an underground 
complex or in the interior of aboveground ruins, but an 
inhabited dungeon might have light sources. 
In subterranean settlements , even races that have 
darkvision use fire for warmth, cooking, and defense. 
But many creatures have no need of warmth or light. 
Adventurers must bring their own sources of light into 
usty tombs where only undead stand guard, abandoned 
;uins teeming with predatory monsters and oozes, and 
natural caverns where sightless creatures hunt. 
The light of a torch or lantern helps a character 
: e over a short distance, but other creatures can 
: e that light source from far away. Bright light in an 
environment of total darkness can be visible for miles, 
j]ough a clear line of sight over such a distance is rare 
underground. Even so, adventurers using light sources 
JJ a dungeon often attract monsters , just as dungeon 
•eatures that shed light (from phosphorescent fungi 
-o the glow of magical portals) can draw adventurers' 
anention. 
_UR QUALITY 
ubterranean tunnels and aboveground ruins are often 
enclosed spaces with little airflow. Though it's rare for 
a dungeon to be sealed so tightly that adventurers have 
ouble breathing, the atmosphere is often stifling and 
oppressive. What's more, odors linger in a dungeon and 
can be magnified by the stillness of the atmosphere. 
OUNDS 
A dungeon's enclosed geography helps channel sound. 
The groaning creak of an opening door can echo down 
hundreds of feet of passageway. Louder·noises such 
a the clanging hammers of a forge or the din of battle 
can reverberate through an entire dungeon. Many 
creatures that live underground use such sounds as a 
"';'\ay of locating prey, or go on alert at any sound of an 
adventuring party's intrusion. 
DUNGE ON HAZARDS 
The hazards described here are but a few examples of 
the environmental dangers found underground and in 
other dark places. Dungeon hazards are functionally 
imilar to traps, which are described at the end of 
this chapter. 
Detecting a Hazard. No ability check is required 
to spot a hazard unless it is hidden. A hazard that 
resembles something benign, such as a patch of slime 
or mold, can be correctly identified with a successful 
Intelligence (Nature) check. Use the guidelines in 
chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any check made 
to spot or recognize a hazard. 
Hazard Severity. To determine a hazard's deadliness 
relative to the characters, think of the hazard as a trap 
and compare the damage it deals with the party's level 
using the Damage Severity by Level table later in the 
chapter (the table also appears in chapter 8). 
BROWN MOLD 
Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from 
anything around it. A patch of brown mold typically 
covers a 10-foot square, and the temperature within 30 
feet of it is always frigid. When a creature moves to within 5 feet of the mold 
for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it 
must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 
22 (4d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 
Brown mold is immune to fire, and any source of fire 
brought within 5 feet of a patch causes it to instantly 
expand outward in the direction of the fire, covering a 
10-foot-square area (with the source of the fire at the 
center of that area). A patch of brown mold exposed to 
an effect that deals cold damage is instantly destroyed. 
GREEN SLIME 
This acidic slime devours flesh, organic material, and 
metal on contact. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings 
to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches. 
A patch of green slime covers a 5-foot square, has 
blindsight out to a range of 30 feet, and drops from 
walls and ceilings when it detects movement below it. 
Beyond that, it has no ability to move. A creature aware 
of the slime's presence can avoid being struck by it with 
a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Otherwis e, 
the slime can't be avoided as it drops. 
A creature that comes into contact with green slime 
takes 5 (1d10) acid damage. The creature takes the 
damage again at the start of each of its turns until the 
slime is scraped off or destroyed. Against wood or 
metal, green slime deals 11 (2d10) acid damage each 
round, and any nonmagical wood or metal weapon or 
tool used to scrape off the slime is effectively destroyed. 
Sunlight, any effect that cures disease, and any effect 
that deals cold, fire, or radiant damage destroys a patch 
of green slime. 
WEBS 
Giant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages 
and at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled 
areas are difficult terrain. Moreover, a creature entering 
a webbed area for the first time on a turn or starting its 
turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving 
throw or become restrained by the webs. A restrained 
creature can use its action to try to escape, doing 
so with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
Each 10-foot cube of giant webs has AC 10, 15 
hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to 
bludgeoning , piercing, and psychic damage. 
YELLOW MOLD 
Yellow mold grows in dark places, and one patch covers 
a 5-foot square. If touched, the mold ejects a cloud of 
spores that fills a 10-foot cube originating from the 
mold. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 
15 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison 
damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. While 
poisoned in this way, the creature takes 5 (1d10) poison 
damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. 
Sunlight or any amount of fire damage instantly 
destroys one patch of yellow mold. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS 
105 
ro6 r WILDERNESS 
Between the dungeons and settlements of your 
campaign world lie meadows, forests, deserts, mountain 
ranges, oceans, and other tracts of wilderness waiting 
to be traversed. Bringing wilderness areas to life can be 
a fun part of your game, both for you and your players. 
The following two approaches work particularly well. 
TRAVEL -MONTAGE APPROACH 
Sometim es the destination is more important than the 
journey. If the purpose of a wilderness trek is to get 
the characters to where the real adventure happens, 
gloss over the wilderness trek without checking for 
encounters along the way. Just as movies use travel 
montages to convey long and arduous journeys in a 
matter of seconds, you can use a few sentences of 
descriptive text to paint a picture of a wilderness trek in 
your players' minds before moving on. 
Describe the journey as vividly as you like, but keep 
the forward momentum . "You walk for several miles 
and encounter nothing of interest" is okay, but far less 
evocative and memorable than, "A light rain dampens 
the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, 
you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue 
finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but 
otherwise you encounter nothing out of the ordinary." 
The trick is to focus on a few details that reinforce the 
desired mood rather than describe everything down to 
the last blade of grass. 
Call attention to unusual terrain features: a waterfall, 
a rocky outcropping that offers a breathtaking view over 
the tops of the surrounding trees, an area where the 
forest has burned or been cut down, and so on. Also 
describe notable smells and sounds, such as the roar of 
a faraway monster, the stench of burned wood, or the 
sweet aroma of flowers in an elven forest. 
In addition to evocative language , visual aids can help 
set the scene for the characters' travels. Image searches 
on the Internet can lead you to breathtaking landscapes 
(in fact, that's a good phrase to search for) both real and 
fantastical. As striking as real-world scenery can be, 
wilderness travel can be used to remind the players that 
their characters are in a fantasy world. Once in a while, 
spice up your descriptions with some truly magical 
element. A forest might be home to tiny dragonets 
instead of birds, or its trees might be festooned with 
giant webs or have eerie, green-glowing sap. Use these 
elements sparingly; landscapes that are too alien can 
break your players' sense of immersion in the world. A 
single fantastic element within an otherwise realistic 
and memorable landscape is enough. 
Use the landscape to set the mood and tone for your 
adventure. In one forest, close-set trees shroud all 
light and seem to watch the adventurers as they pass. 
In another, sunlight streams through the leaves above 
and flower-laden vines twine up every trunk. Signs 
of corruption-rotting wood, foul-smelling water, and 
rocks covered with slimy brown moss-can be a signal 
that the adventurers are drawing close to the site of evil 
power that is their destination or can provide clues to 
the nature of the threats to be found there. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS Specific wilderness locations might have their own 
special features. For example, the Spirit Forest and 
the Spiderha unt Woods might feature different kinds 
of trees, different kinds of flora and fauna, different 
weather. and different random encounter tables. 
Finally, a wilderness trek can be enhanced by calling 
attention to the weather. "You spend the next three 
days crossing the swamp" sounds less harrowing than, 
"You spend the next three days trudging through knee­
deep mud-the first two days and nights in the pouring 
rain, and then another day under the beating sun, with 
swarms of hungry insects feasting on your blood." 
HouR-BY-HouR APPROACH 
Sometimes the journey deserves as much time and 
attention as the destination. If wilderness travel featur e 
prominently in your adventure and isn't something you 
want to gloss over, you will need more than a descripti ve 
overview to bring a long and harrowing journey to life; 
you'll need to know the party's marching order and have 
encounters at the ready. 
Let your players determine the party's marching 
order (see the Player's Handbook for more information ). 
Characters in the front rank are likely to be the first to 
notice landmarks and terrain features, as well as the 
ones responsible for navigating. Characters in the back 
rank are usually responsible for making sure that the 
party isn't being followed. Encourage characters in the 
middle ranks to do something other than blindly trudge 
along behind the front-rank characters. The Player's 
Handbook suggests activities such as mapmaking and 
foraging for food. 
Wilderness journeys typically feature a combination of 
planned encounters (encounters that you prepare ahead 
of time) and random encounters (encounters determined 
by rolling on a table). A planned encounter might need a 
m~p of the location where the encounter is set to occur, 
such as a ruin, a bridge spanning a gorge, or some other 
memorable location. Random encounters tend to be 
less location-specific . The fewer planned encounters 
you have, the more you'll need to rely on random 
encounters to keep the journey interesting . See chapter 
3 for guidelines on creating your own random encounter 
tables and when to check for random encounters. 
A good way to keep wilderness encounters from 
becoming stale is to make sure they don't all start and 
end the same way. In other words, if the wilderness 
is your stage and your adventure is the play or movie, 
think of each wilderness encounter as its own scene, 
and try to stage each one in a slightly different way to 
keep your players' interest. If one encounter comes 
at the adventurers from the front, the next one might 
come at them from above or behind. If an encounter 
features stealthy monsters , a character tending to the 
party's pack animals might get the first indication that 
monsters are near when a pony whickers nervously. If 
an encounter features loud monsters , the party might 
have the option to hide or set an ambush. One group of 
monsters might attack the party on sight, and another 
might allow safe passage for food. 
Reward characters for searching while they travel by 
providing things for them to find. Broken statues, tracks, 

abandoned campsites, and other finds can add flavor to 
your world, foreshadow future encounters or events, or 
provide hooks for further adventures. 
A wilderness journey might take multiple sessions to 
play out. That said, if the wilderness journey includes 
long periods with no encounters, use the travel-montage 
approach to bridge gaps between encounters. 
MAPPING A WILDERNESS 
In contrast to a dungeon , an outdoor setting presents 
seemingly limitless options. The adventurers can move 
in any direction over a trackless desert or an open 
grassland, so how do you as the DM deal with all the 
possible locations and events that might make up a 
wilderness campaign? What if you design an encounter 
in a desert oasis, but the characters miss the oasis 
because they wander off course? How do you avoid 
creating a boring play session of uninterrupted slogging 
across a rocky wasteland? 
One solution is to think of an outdoor setting in the 
same way you think about a dungeon. Even the most 
wide-open terrain presents clear pathways . Roads 
seldom run straight because they follow the contours 
of the land, finding the most level or otherwise easiest 
routes across uneven ground. Valleys and ridges 
channel travel in certain directions. Mountain ranges 
present forbidding barriers traversed only by remote 
passes. Even the most trackless desert reveals favored 
routes, where explorers and caravan drivers have 
discovered areas of wind-blasted rock that are easier to 
traverse than shifting sand. 
If the party veers off track, you might be able to 
relocate one or more of your planned encounters 
elsewhere on the map to ensure that the time spent 
preparing those encounters doesn't go to waste. 
Chapter 1 discusses the basics of creating a 
wilderness map at three different scales to help 
you design your world and the starting area of your 
campaign . Especially when you get down to province 
scale (1 hex= 1 mile), think about paths of travel-roads, 
passes, ridges and valleys, and so on-that can guide 
character movement across your map. 
MOVEMENT ON THE MAP 
Narrate wilderness travel at a level of detail appropriate 
to the map you're using. If you're tracking hour-by-hour 
movement on a province-scale map (1 hex= 1 mile), 
you can describe each hamlet the adventurers pass. 
At this scale, you can assume that the characters find 
a noteworthy location when they enter its hex unl~ss 
the site is specifically hidden. The characters might not 
walk directly up to the front door of a ruined castle when 
they enter a hex, but they can find old paths, outlying 
ruins, and other signs of its presence in the area. 
If you're tracking a journey of several days on a 
kingdom-scale map (1 hex= 6 miles), don't bother with 
details too small to appear on your map. It's enough 
for the players to know that on the third day of their 
journey, they cross a river and the land starts rising 
before them, and that they reach the mountain pass two 
days later. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS WILDERNESS FEATURES 
o wilderness map is complete without a few 
settlements , strongholds, ruins, and other sites worthy 
of discovery. A dozen such locations scattered over an 
area roughly 50 miles across is a good start. 
Mo STER LAIRS 
A wilderness area approximately 50 miles across can 
support roughly a half-dozen monster lairs, but probably 
no more than one apex predator such as a dragon. 
If you expect the characters to explore a monster's 
lair, you'll need to find or create an appropriate map for 
the lair and stock the lair as you would a dungeon . 
MONUMENTS 
In places where civilization rules or once ruled, 
adventurers might find monuments built to honor great 
leaders, gods, and cultures. Use the Monuments table 
for inspiration, or randomly roll to determine what 
monument the adventurers stumble upon. 
MONUMENTS 
d20 Monument

2 Plundered burial mound or pyramid 
3 Faces carved into a mountainside or cliff 
4 Giant statues carved out of a mountainside or cliff

16 Great stone arch 
17 Fountain 
18 Intact circle of standing stones 
19 Ruined or toppled circle of standing stones 
20 Totem pole 
RUINS 
Crumbling towers, ancient temples, and razed cities 
are perfect sites for adventures. Additionally , noting the 
existence of an old, crumbling wall that runs alongside a 
road, a sagging stone windmill on a hilltop, or a jumble 
of standing stones can add texture to your wilderness. 
SETTLEMENTS 
Settlements exist in places where food, water, farmland , 
and building materials are abundant. A civilized 
province roughly 50 miles across might have one city, a 
few rural towns, and a scattering of villages and trading 
posts. An uncivilized area might have a single trading 
post that stands at the edge of a wild frontier, but no 
larger settlements. 
In addition to settlements , a province might contain 
ruined villages and towns that are either abandoned or 
serve as lairs for marauding bandits and monsters. 
STRONGHOLDS 
Strongholds provide the local population with protection 
in times of trouble. The number of strongholds in an 
area depends on the dominant society, the population , 
the strategic importance or vulnerability of the region, 
and the wealth of the land. 
WEIRD LOCALES 
Weird locales make the fantastic and the supernatural 
an intrinsic part of your wilderness adventures. 
WEIRD LOCALES

WILDERNESS SURVIVAL 
Adventuring in the wilderness presents a host of 
perils beyond the threats of monstrous predators and 
avage raiders. 
WEATHER 
You can pick weather to fit your campaign or roll on the 
Weather table to determine the weather for a given day, 
adjusting for the terrain and season as appropriate.

no EXTREME COLD 
Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees 
Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed 
on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each 
hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with 
resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically 
succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing 
cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and 
creatures naturally adapted to cold climates. 
EXTREME HEAT 
When the temperature is at or above 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit , a creature exposed to the heat and 
without access to drinkable water must succeed on 
a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour 
or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the 
first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. 
Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are 
clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving 
throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire 
damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as 
do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates. 
STRONG WIND 
A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon 
attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on 
hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, 
disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means 
nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind 
must land at the end of its turn or fall. 
A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that 
imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks 
that rely on sight. 
HEAVY PRECIPITATION 
Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy 
snowfall is lightly obscured, and creatures in the area 
have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that 
rely on sight. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames 
and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks that rely on hearing. 
HIGH ALTITUDE 
--------------~------------------Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above 
sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, 
because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the 
air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at 
high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of 
determining how long that creature can travel. 
Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high 
altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. 
Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to 
elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to 
such environments. 
WILDERNESS HAZARDS 
This section describes a few examples of hazards that 
adventurers might encounter in the wilderness. 
Some hazards, such as slippery ice and razorvine , 
require no ability check to spot. Others, such as 
defiled ground, are undetectable by normal senses. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVJRONMENTS The other hazards presented here can be identified 
with a successful Intelligence (Nature) check. Use the 
guidelines in chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any 
check made to spot or recognize a hazard. 
DESECRATE D GROUND 
Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the 
unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated 
ground can be any size, and a detect evil and good spell 
cast within range reveals its presence . 
Undead standing on desecrated ground have 
advantage on all saving throws. 
A vial of holy water purifies a 10-foot-square area of 
desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a hallow 
spell purifies desecrated ground within its area. 
FRIGID WATER 
A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a 
number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before 
suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent 
in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a 
DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of 
exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to 
cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw. 
as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in 
ice-cold water. 
QUICKSAND 
A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a 10-foot­
square area and is usually 10 feet deep. When a creature 
enters the area, it sinks ld4 + 1 feet into the quicksand 
and becomes restrained. At the start of each of the 
creature's turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as 
the creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand , 
it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a 
Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet 
the creature has sunk into the quicksand . A creature 
that is completely submerged in quicksand can't breathe 
(see the suffocation rules in the Player's Handbook). 
A creature can pull another creature within its reach 
out of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeedin g 
on a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of 
feet the target creature has sunk into the quicksand. 
RAZORVINE 
Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and 
hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and 
other surfaces as ivy does. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide , 
5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has AC 11, 25 
hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and 
psychic damage. 
When a creature comes into direct contact with 
razorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature 
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or 
take 5 (1d10) slashing damage from the razorvine's 
bladelike thorns. 
SLIPPERY IcE 
Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves 
onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must 
succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or 
fall prone. 
THIN leE 
Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 x 10 pounds per 
10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an 
area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area 
breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall through. 
FORAGING 
Characters can gather food and water as the party 
travels at a normal or slow pace. A foraging character 
makes a Wisdom (Survival) check whenever you call for 
it, with the DC determined by the abundance of food and 
water in the region.

If multiple characters forage, each character makes 
a separate check. A foraging character finds nothing 
on a failed check. On a successful check, roll ld6 +the 
character's Wisdom modifier to determine how much 
food (in pounds) the character finds, then repeat the roll 
for water (in gallons). FooD AND WATER 
The food and water requirements noted in the Player's 
Handbook are for characters. Horses and other 
creatures require different quantities of food and water 
per day based on their size. Water needs are doubled if 
the weather is hot. 
FooD AND WATER NEEDS 
Creature Size Food per Day Water per Day 
Tiny 1/4 pound 1/4 gallon 
Small 1 pound 1 gallon

Gargantuan 64 pounds 64 gallons 
BECOMING LOST 
Unless they are following a path, or something like it, 
adventurers traveling in the wilderness run the risk of 
becoming lost. The party's navigator makes a Wisdom 
(Survival) check when you decide it's appropriate, 
against a DC determined by the prevailing terrain, as 
shown on the Wilderness Navigation table. If the party 
is moving at a slow pace, the navigator gains a +5 bonus 
to the check, and a fast pace imposes a -5 penalty. If the 
party has an accurate map of the region or can see the 
sun or stars, the navigator has advantage on the check. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS liT 
II2 If the Wisdom (Survival) check succeeds, the party 
travels in the desired direction without becoming lost. 
If the check fails, the party inadvertently travels in the 
wrong direction and becomes lost. The party's navigator 
can repeat the check after the party spends ld6 hours 
trying to get back on course.

A village, town, or city makes an excellent backdrop for 
an adventure. The adventurers might be called on to 
track down a criminal who's gone into hiding, solve a 
murder, take out a gang of wererats or doppelgangers, 
or protect a settlement under siege. 
When creating a settlement for your campaign, focus 
on the locations that are most relevant to the adventure. 
Don't worry about naming every street and identifying 
the inhabitants of every building; that way lies madness.

RANDOM BUILDINGS 
Pulse-pounding chases and harrowing escapes within 
the confines of a town or city can sometimes force 
characters to dash into buildings. When you need to 
flesh out a building quickly, roll on the Building Type 
table. Then roll on the table corresponding to that 
building to add further detail. 
If a roll makes no sense considering where the 
characters are (such as a lavish mansion in a rundown 
part of town), you can always roll again or simply choose 
another result. However , such unexpected results can 
prompt creativity and memorable locations that help 
make your urban encounters distinct.

MAPPING A SETTLEMENT 
When you draw a map for a settlement in your game, 
don't worry about the placement of every building, and 
concentrate instead on the major features. 
For a village, sketch out the roads, including trade 
routes leading beyond the village and roads that connect 
outlying farms to the village center. Note the location of 
the village center. If the adventurers visit specific places 
in the village, mark those spots on your map. 
For towns and cities, note major roads and waterways 
as well as surrounding terrain. Outline the walls 
and mark the locations of features you know will be 
important: the lord's keep, significant temples, and 
the like. For cities, add internal walls and think about 
the personality of each ward. Give the wards names 
reflecting their personalities, which also identify 
the kinds of trades that dominate the neighborhood 
(Tannery Square, Temple Row), a geographical 
characteristic (Hilltop, Riverside), or a dominant site 
(the Lords' Quarter). 
URBAN ENCOUNTERS 
Although they hold the promise of safety, cities and 
towns can be just as dangerous as the darkest dungeon. 
Evil hides in plain sight or in dark corners. Sewers, 
shadowy alleys, slums, smoke-filled taverns, dilapidated 
tenements, and crowded marketplaces can quickly turn 
into battlegrounds . On top of that, adventurers must 
learn to behave themselves , lest they attract unwanted 
attention from local authorities. · 
That said, characters who don't go looking for trouble 
can take advantage of all the benefits that a settlement 
has to offer. 
LAW AND ORDER 
Whether a settlement has a police force depends on its 
size and nature. A lawful, orderly city might have a city 
watch to maintain order and a trained militia to defend 
its walls, and a frontier town might rely on adventurers 
or its citizenry to apprehend criminals and fend off 
attackers. 
TRIALS 
In most settlements, trials are overseen by magistrates 
or local lords. Some trials are argued, with the 
conflicting parties or their advocates presenting 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS precedent and evidence until the judge makes 
a decision. with or without the aid of spells or 
interrogation. Others are decided with a trial by ordeal 
or trial by combat. If the evidence against the accused 
is overwhelming, a magistrate or local lord can forgo a 
trial and skip right to the sentencing. 
SENTENCES 
A settlement might have a jail to hold accused criminals 
awaiting trial, but few settlements have prisons to 
incarcerate convicted criminals. A person found guilty 
of a crime is usually fined, condemned to forced labor 
for a period of several months or years, exiled, or 
executed, depending on the magnitude of the crime. 
RANDOM URBAN ENCOUNTERS 
The Random Urban Encounters table is useful for 
city-and town-based adventures. Check for a random 
encounter at least once per day, and once at night if 
the characters are out and about. Reroll the result if it 
doesn't make sense given the time of day.

Animals on the Loose. The characters see one or 
more unexpected animals loose in the street. This 
challenge could be anything from a pack of baboons to 
an escaped circus bear, tiger, or elephant. 
Announcement. A herald, town crier, mad person, 
or other individual makes an announcement on a 
street corner for all to hear. The announcement might 
foreshadow some upcoming event (such as a public 
execution), communicate important information to the 
general masses (such as a new royal decree), or convey a 
dire omen or warning. 
Brawl. A brawl erupts near the adventurers. It could 
be a tavern brawl; a battle between rival factions, 
families, or gangs in the city; or a struggle between 
city guards and criminals. The characters could be 
/ 
~~ 
I , " ,..

u6 witnesses, hit by stray arrow fire, or mistaken for 
members of one group and attacked by the other. 
Bullies. The characters witness ld4 + 2 bullies 
harassing an out-of-towner (use the commoner statistics 
in the Monster Manual for all of them). A bully flees as 
soon as he or she takes any amount of damage. 
Companion. One or more characters are approached 
by a local who takes a friendly interest in the party's 
activities. As a twist, the would-be companion might be 
a spy sent to gather information on the adventurers. 
Contest. The adventurers are drawn into an 
impromptu contest-a nything from an intellectual test 
to a drinking competition-or witness a duel. 
Corpse. The adventurers find a humanoid corpse. 
Draft. The characters are drafted by a member of the 
city or town watch, who needs their help to deal with an 
immediate problem. As a twist, the member of the watch 
might be a disguised criminal trying to lure the party 
into an ambush (use the thug statistics in the Monster 
Manual for the criminal and his or her cohorts). 
Drunk. A tipsy drunk staggers toward a random party 
member, mistaking him or her for someone else. 
Fire. A fire breaks out, and the characters have a 
chance to help put out the flames before it spreads. 
Found Trinket. The characters find a random trinket. 
You can determine the trinket by rolling on the Trinkets 
table in the Player's Handbook . 
Guard Harassment. The adventurers are cornered 
by ld4 + 1 guards eager to throw their weight around. If 
threatened, the guards call out for help and might attract 
the attention of other guards or citizens nearby. 
Pickpocket. A thief (use the spy statistics in the 
Monster Manual) tries to steal from a random character. 
Characters whose passive Wisdom (Perception) scores 
are equal to or greater than the thief's Dexterity (Sleight 
of Hand) check total catch the theft in progress. 
Procession. The adventurers encounter a group of 
citizens either parading in celebration or forming a 
funeral procession. 
Protest. The adventurers see a group of citizens 
peacefully protesting a new law or decree. A handful of 
guards maintain order. 
Runaway Cart. A team of horses pulling a wagon 
races through the city streets. The adventurers must 
avoid the horses. If they stop the wagon, the owner (who 
is running behind the cart) is grateful. 
Shady Transaction. The characters witness a shady 
transaction between two cloaked figures. 
Spectacle. The characters witness a form of public 
entertainment, such as a talented bard's impersonation 
of a royal personage , a street circus, a puppet show, 
a flashy magic act, a royal visit, or a public execution. 
Urchin. A street urchin gloms onto the adventurers 
and follows them around until frightened off. 
UNUSUAL ENVIRONMENTS 
Traveling through the wilderness doesn't always mean 
an overland trek. Adventurers might ply the open sea in 
a caravel or an elemental-powered galleon, soar through 
the air on hippogriffs or a carpet of flying, or ride giant 
sea horses to coral palaces deep beneath the sea. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS U DERWATER 
See chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook for rules on 
underwater combat. 
RANDOM UNDERSEA ENCOUNTERS 
You can check for random undersea encounters as often 
as you would check for them on land (see chapter 3). The 
Random Undersea Encounters table presents several 
intriguing options. You can either roll on the table for a 
random result or choose whichever one works best.

19 Storm giant walking on the ocean floor 
20 Sunken treasure chest (25 percent chance that 
it contains something of value; roll treasure

SwiMMING 
Unless aided by magic, a character can't swim for a 
full 8 hours per day. After each hour of swimming , a 
character must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving 
throw or gain one level of exhaustion. 
A creature that has a swimming speed-including a 
character with a ring of swimming or similar magic­
can swim all day without penalty and uses the normal 
forced march rules in the Player's Handbook. 
Swimming through deep water is similar to traveling 
at high altitudes , because of the water's pressure and 
cold temperature. For a creature without a swimming 
speed, each hour spent swimming at a depth greater 
than 100 feet counts as 2 hours for the purpose of 
determining exhaustion. Swimming for an hour at a 
depth greater than 200 feet counts as 4 hours. 
NDERWATER VISIBILITY 
\'isibility underwater depends on water clarity and the 
available light. Unless the characters have light sources, 
use the Underwater Encounter Distance table to 
determine the distance at which characters underwater 
become aware of a possible encounter. 
UNDERWATER ENCOUNTER DISTANCE 
Creature Size 
Clear water, bright light 
Clear water, dim light

10ft. THE SEA 
Characters can row a boat for 8 hours per day, or can 
row longer at the risk of exhaustion (as per the rules for 
a forced march in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). A 
fully crewed sailing vessel can sail all day, assuming its 
sailors work in shifts. 
NAVIGATION 
Seagoing vessels stay close to shore when they can, 
because navigation is easier when landmarks are 
visible. As long as a ship is within sight of land, there 
is no chance of the vessel becoming lost. Otherwise , a 
ship's navigator must rely on dead reckoning (tracking 0 
0 
the direction and distance of the ship's travel) or the sun 
and the stars. 
Use the Wilderness Navigation table earlier in this 
chapter to determine whether a ship veers off course. 
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS AT SEA 
You can check for random encounters at sea as often 
as you would check for them on land (see chapter 3 for 
more information). The Random Encounters at Sea 
table presents a number of options and ideas. 
SHIPWRECKS 
A shipwreck is a plot device that can be used sparingly to 
great effect, particularly if you want the characters to be 
washed ashore on some monster-infested island or (in the 
case of an airship) dropped in the middle of some exotic 
land. There aren't rules for determining when a shipwreck 
happens; it happens when you want or need it to happen. 
Even the strongest seafaring ship can founder in a storm, 
run aground on rocks or reefs, sink during a pirate attack, or 
be dragged underwater by a sea monster. A storm orhungry 
dragon can lay waste to an airship just as easily. A shipwreck 
has the potential to change the direction of a campaign . It 
isn't, however, a particularly good way to kill off characters or 
end a campaign . 
If you and your campaign conspire to wreck a ship on 
which the characters are traveling, it is assumed that the 
characters survive with the equipment they were wearing or 
carrying still in their possession. The fate of any N PCs and 
cargo aboard the wrecked ship is entirely up to you.

WEATHER AT SEA 
Use the Weather table earlier in this chapter when 
checking for weather at sea. 
If weather conditions indicate both a strong wind 
and heavy rain, they combine to create a storm with 
high waves. A crew caught in a storm loses sight of all 
landmarks (unless there's a lighthouse or other bright 
feature), and ability checks made to navigate during the 
storm have disadvantage. 
AIRBORNE AND WATERBORNE VEHICLES 
Ship Cost Speed Crew Passengers Cargo (tons) AC HP Damage Threshold 
Airship 20,000 gp 8 mph 10 
Galley 30,000 gp 4 mph 80

Rowboat 50 gp ll/2 mph 1 
Sailing ship 10,000 gp 2 mph 20 
Warship 25,000 gp 21/2 mph 60 
In a dead calm (no wind), ships can't move under sail 
and must be rowed. A ship sailing against a strong wind 
moves at half speed. 
ISIBILITY 
A relatively calm sea offers great visibility. From a 
crow's nest, a lookout can spot another ship or a 
oastline up to 10 miles away, assuming clear skies. 
Overcast skies reduce that distance by half. Rain and 
-og reduce visibility just as they do on land. 
OWNING A SHIP 
At some point in your campaign, the adventurers 
might gain custody of a ship. They might purchase or 
capture one or receive one to carry out a mission. It's 
up to you whether a ship is available for purchase , and 
you have the power to deprive the adventurers of a 
hip at any time should it become a nuisance (see the 
-Shipwrecks " sidebar). 
Crew. A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to 
"unction. As per the Player's Handbook , one skilled 
hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum 
number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship 
depends on the type of vessel, as shown in the Airborne 
and Waterborne Vehicles table. 
You can track the loyalty of individual crew members 
or the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules 
in chapter 4. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal 
during a voyage, the crew turns hostile and stages a 
mutiny. If the ship is berthed, disloyal crew members 
leave the ship and never return. 
Passengers. The table indicates the number of Small 
and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate. 
Accommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight 
quarters. A ship outfitted with private accommodations 
can carry one-fifth as many passengers. 
A passenger is usually expected to pay 5 sp per day 
for a hammock , but prices can vary from ship to ship. A 
mall private cabin usually costs 2 gp per day. 
Cargo. The table indicates the maximum tonnage 
each kind of ship can carry. 
Damage Threshold. A ship has immunity to all 
damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or 
greater than its damage threshold , in which case it takes 
damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or 
exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial 
and doesn't reduce the ship's hit points. 
Ship Repair. Repairs to a damaged ship can be made 
. hile the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of 
amage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials 
and labor. 20

THE SKY 
Flying characters can move from one place to another in 
a relatively straight line, ignoring terrain and monsters 
that can't fly or that lack ranged attacks. 
Flying by spell or magic item works the same as 
travel on foot, as described in the Player's Handbook. A 
creature that serves as a flying mount must rest 1 hour 
for every 3 hours it flies, and it can't fly for more than 
9 hours per day. Thus, characters mounted on griffons 
(which have a flying speed of 80 feet) can travel at 8 
miles per hour, covering 72 miles over 9 hours with two 
1-hour-long rests over the course of the day. Mounts that 
don't tire (such as a flying construct) aren't subject to 
this limitation .

result that indicates a non-flying monster, unless the 
characters are flying close enough to the ground to be 
targeted by non-flying creatures making ranged attacks. 
Characters have normal chances to spot creatures on 
the ground and can decide whether to engage them. 
TRAPS 
Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step 
in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything 
blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The 
seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave 
entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes 
through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop 
on travelers who pass underneath . In the D&D game, 
unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned 
alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts. 
A trap can be either mechanical or magical in 
nature. Mechanical traps include pits, arrow 
traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling 
blades, and anything else that depends on 
a mechanism to operate. Magic traps are either 
magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device 
traps initiate spell effects when activated . Spell traps 
are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that 
function as traps. 
CHAPTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS SIN PLAY 
When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know 
how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the 
possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to 
disable or avoid it. 
TRIGGERING A TRAP 
Most traps are triggered when a creature goes 
somewhere or touches something that the trap's creator 
wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on 
a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip 
wire, turning a doorknob , and using the wrong key in a 
lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature 
enters an area or touches an object. Some magic 
traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more 
complicated trigger conditions, including a password 
that prevents the trap from activating. 
DETECTING AND DISABLING A TRAP 
Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful 
inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone 
that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off 
a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which 
jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something 
that points to a trap's presence. 
A trap's description specifies the checks and DCs 
needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character 
actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom 
(Perception) check against the trap's DC. You can 
also compare the DC to detect the trap with each 
character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to 
determine whether anyone in the party notices the 
trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before 
triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either 
permanently or long enough to move past it. You might 
call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a 
character to deduce what needs to be done, followed 
by a Dexterity check using thieves' tools to perform the 
necessary sabotage. 
Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) 
check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to 
any other checks noted in the trap's description. The 
DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In 
addition, dispel magic has a chance of disabling most 
magic traps. A magic trap's description provides the DC 
for the ability check made when you use dispel magic. 
In most cases, a trap's description is clear enough 
that you can adjudicate whether a character's actions 
locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you 
shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and 
good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the 
trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's 
design can anticipate every possible action that the 
characters might attempt. 
You should allow a character to discover a trap 
without making an ability check if an action would 
clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a 
character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, 
rhe character has found the trigger and no check 
is required. 
Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. 
Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened 
without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a 
mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward 
anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and 
making a few checks, the characters are still unsure 
if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they 
prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at 
a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still 
rriggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into 
the shield. 
Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow 
them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters 
that place traps in or around their lairs need ways 
ro get past those traps without harming themselves. 
uch traps might have hidden levers that disable their 
triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that 
goes around the trap. 
TRAP EFFECTS 
The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to 
deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, 
-pikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple 
elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature 
unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap's description 
specifies what happens when it is triggered. 
The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its 
effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on 
the trap's severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack 
Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table 
for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity. 
A trap intended to be a setback is unlikely to kill 
or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, 
whereas a dangerous trap is likely to seriously injure 
(and potentially kill) characters of the indicated 
levels. A deadly trap is likely to kill characters of the 
indicated levels.

COMPLEX TRAPS 
Complex traps work like standard traps, except once 
activated they execute a series of actions each round. A 
complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap 
into something more like a combat encounter. 
When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The 
trap's description includes an initiative bonus. On its 
turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It 
might make successive attacks against intruders, create 
APTER 5 I ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS 
l~l 
an effect that changes over time. or otherwi e produce a 
dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be 
detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways. 
For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly 
flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap's turn, 
the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is 
completely flooded. 
SAMPLE TRAPS 
The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary 
in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order. 
COLLAPSING ROOF 
Mechanical trap 
This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports 
keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place. 
The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches 
between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip 
wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using 
thieves' tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A 
character without thieves' tools can attempt this check 
with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged 
tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers. 
Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine 
that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, 
a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap 
to trigger. 
The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, 
and anyone who can see it can tell that it's in danger 
of collapse. 
When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling 
collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable 
section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once 
the trap is \riggered, the floor of the area is filled with 
rubble and becomes difficult terrain. 
FALLING ~~T 
Mechanical trap 
This trap uses\ trip wire to release a net suspended 
from the ceiling\ . 
The trip wire,is'J~nches off the ground and stretches 
between two column~r trees. The net is hidden by 
cobwebs or foliage. The IJC to spot the trip wire and net 
is 10. A successful DC 15 D~~rity check using thieves' 
tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly . A character 
without thieves' tools can attem~ this check with 
disadvantage using any edged wea!'lon or edged tool. On 
a failed check, the trap triggers. 
When the trap is triggered, the net is released , 
covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are 
trapped under the net and restrained , and those that fail 
a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. 
A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength 
check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach 
on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. 
Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 
5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped 
in that section. 
CHAPTE R 5 \ ADVENTURE ENVIRONMENTS fiRE-BREATHL"G --..,_~ ~ 
Magic trap 
This trap is activated when an in-de-tep on a 
hidden pressure plate, relea ina a magical gout of flame 
from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, 
including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell. 
The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as 
faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or 
other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such 
as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic 
around the statue. 
The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of 
weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the 
statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature 
in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 
Wedging an iron spike or other object under the 
pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A 
successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue 
destroys the trap. 
PITS 
Mechanical trap 
Four basic pit traps are presented here. 
Simple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the 
ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on 
the pit's edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris. 
The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the 
cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, 
taking damage based on the pit's depth (usually 10 feet, 
but some pits are deeper). 
Hidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from 
material identical to the floor around it. 
A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check 
discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section 
of floor that forms the pit's cover. A successful DC 
15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to 
confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the 
cover of a pit. 
When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open 
like a trapdoor , causing the intruder to spill into the 
pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can 
be deeper. 
Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar 
object can be wedged between the pit's cover and the 
surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover 
from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover 
can also be magically held shut using the arcane lock 
spell or similar magic. 
Locking Pit. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit 
trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers 
the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, 
the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside. 
A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to 
pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open 
(determine the cover's statistics using the guidelines 
in chapter 8). A character in the pit can also attempt to 
disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 
15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the 
mechanism can be reached and the character can see. 
In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a 
secret door nearby) opens the pit. 
Spiked Pit. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or 
locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes 
at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 
(2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to 
any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison 
smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking 
piercing damage from the spikes must also make a 
DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) 
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
on a successful one. 
POISON DARTS 
Mechanical trap 
When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, 
poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or 
pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding 
walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, 
each one rigged to its own set of darts. 
The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and 
cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or 
frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC tq spot them is 
15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check, a character can deduce the presence of the 
pressure plate from variations in the mortar and 
stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding 
floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the 
pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing 
the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained 
within from launching. 
The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of 
weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four 
darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus 
against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure 
plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are 
no targets in the area, the darts don't hit anything.) A 
target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must 
ucceed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 
11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 
POISON NEEDLE 
J1echanical trap 
A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest's 
lock, or in something else that a creature might open. 
Opening the chest without the proper key causes the 
needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison. 
When the trap is triggered , the needle extends 3 
mches straight out from the lock. A creature within 
range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison 
am age, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
-aving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. 
A successf ul DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
allows a character to deduce the trap's presence from 
al£erations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. 
_ _,_ uccessful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from 
the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock 
triggers the trap. 
ROLLING SPHERE 
Mechanical trap 
When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this 
trap's pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling 
opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of 
solid stone. 
With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, 
a cb.aracter can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate .. 
A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 
15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations 
in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate's 
presence. The same check made while inspecting the 
ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the 
trapdoor . Wedging an iron spike or other object under 
the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. 
Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present 
to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 
bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. 
The sphere can move through creatures' spaces, and 
creatures can move through its space, treating it as 
difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature's 
space or a creature enters its space while it's rolling, 
that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be 
knocked prone. 
The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. 
It can't go around corners, but smart dungeon builders 
incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages 
that allow the sphere to keep moving. 
As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can 
attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. 
On a successful check, the sphere's speed is reduced by 
15 feet. If the sphere's speed drops to 0, it stops moving 
and is no longer a threat. 
SPHERE OF ANNIHILATION 
Magic trap 
Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth 
of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in 
diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, 
no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter 
that enters it is instantly obliterated. 
A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check 
reveals that the mouth contains a sphere of annihilation 
that can't be controlled or moved. It is otherwise 
identical to a normal sphere of annihilation, as 
described in chapter 7, "Treasure. " 
Some versions of the trap include an enchantment 
placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures 
feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl 
inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the 
sympathy aspect of the antipathy /sympathy spell. 
A successful dispel magic (DC 18) removes this 
enchantment. 

CHAPTER 6: BETWEEN ADVENTURES 
CAMPAIGN IS MUCH MORE THAN A SERIES OF 
adventures. It also includes the moments 
between them-the various distractions and 
side pursuits that engage the characters 
when they're not exploring the wilderness , 
plundering dungeons , and gallivanting 
around the multiverse on some epic quest. 
The natural pace of a campaign offers lulls between 
adventures, time for the characters to spend their 
treasure and pursue their goals. This downtime gives 
the characters an opportunity to sink their roots a little 
deeper into the world, building a personal investment 
in what happens to the people and places around them, 
which can, in turn, draw them into further adventures. 
Chapter 5, "Equipment," of the Player's Handbook 
details the expenses that a character incurs for 
basic necessities, depending on the lifestyle the 
character chooses, from poverty to luxury. Chapter 
8, "Adventuring," of that book describes some of 
the downtime activities they can pursue between 
adventures. This chapter fills in the gaps, describing 
the expenses of owning property and hiring NPCs, and 
a variety of additional downtime activities characters 
can pursue. The beginning of the chapter also offers 
suggestions for linking adventures together and keeping 
track of events in your campaign. 
LINKING ADVENTURES 
A campaign in the style of an episodic television show 
rarely needs story links between its adventures. Each 
adventure features its own villains, and once the 
characters complete the adventure, there are typically 
no loose plot threads. The next adventure presents 
an altogether different challenge having nothing to do 
with the adventure that preceded it. As the characters 
gain experience points, they become more powerful , 
as do the threats they must overcome. This kind of 
campaign is easy to run, since it requires little effort 
beyond finding or creating adventures appropriate for 
the party's level. 
A campaign with a narrative lets the players feel as 
though their actions have far-reaching consequences. 
They're not just racking up experience points. A few 
simple modifications can help you overlay overarching 
elements to create a serialized campaign in which early 
adventures help set up later ones. 
USING AN 0VERARCHING STORY 
This section presents a couple of examples of 
overarching stories which have, over the years, fueled 
many classic D&D campaigns. 
The adventurers' goal in the first example is to amass 
the power they need to defeat a powerful enemy that 
threatens the world. Their goal in the second example 
is to defend something they care about by destroying 
whatever threatens it. The two examples are, in effect, 
the same story (variations of the battle between good 
and evil) told in different ways. EXAMPLE 1: THE QUEST OF MANY PARTS 
You can tie adventures together using an overarching 
goal that can be fulfilled only by first completing a series 
of related quests. For example, you could create a villain 
who can't be defeated until the characters explore nine 
dungeons in which the Nine Dread Princes reside, with 
each of these dungeons stocked with enough monsters 
and hazards to advance the adventurers two or three 
levels. The adventurers spend their whole careers 
fighting the Nine Dread Princes before finally pursuing 
an epic quest to destroy the princes' monstrous 
progenitor. As long as every dungeon is unique and 
interesting, your players will appreciate the tight focus 
of the campaign. 
In a similar type of quest campaign, the adventurers 
might need to collect fragments of an artifact that 
are scattered in ruins across the multi verse, before 
reassembling the artifact and using it to defeat a 
cosmic threat. 
ExAMPLE 2: AGENTS OF X 
You can also build a campaign around the idea that 
the adventurers are agents of something larger than 
themselves-a kingdom or secret organization, for 
example. Wherever their allegiance lies, the adventurers 
are motivated by loyalty and the goal of protecting 
whatever it is they serve. 
The characters' overarching mission might be to 
explore and map an uncharted region, forging alliances 
where they can and overcoming threats they encounter 
along the way. Their goal might be to find the ancient 
capital of a fallen empire, which lies beyond the realm 
of a known enemy and forces them to navigate hostile 
territory. The characters could be pilgrims in search 
of a holy site or members of a secret order dedicated 
to defending the last bastions of civilization in an ever­
declining world. Or they might be spies and assassins, 
striving to weaken an enemy country by targeting its evil 
leaders and plundering its treasures. 
PLANTING ADVENTURE SEEDS 
You can make a campaign feel like one story with many 
chapters by planting the seeds of the next adventure 
before the current one is finished. This technique can 
naturally moves the characters along to their next goal. 
If you've planted a seed well, the characters have 
something else to do when they finish an adventure. 
Perhaps a character drinks from a magic fountain in a 
dungeon and receives a mystifying vision that leads to 
the next quest. The party might find a cryptic map or 
relic that, once its meaning or purpose is determined, 
points to a new destination. Perhaps an NPC warns 
the characters of impending danger or implores 
them for help. 
The trick is to not distract the characters from the 
adventure at hand. Designing an effective hook for a 
future adventure requires finesse. The lure should be 
compelling , but not so irresistible that the players stop 
caring about what their characters are doing right now. 
CHAPTER 6 I BETWEEN ADVENTURES ( 
\ 
125 
To keep players from straying, save your best ideas for 
the very end of your adventures, or insert them during 
periods of downtime. 
Here are a few examples of ways in which an 
adventure seed can be revealed: 
On a villain's corpse, the characters find evidence that 
the villain was working for someone else. 
A captured NPC reveals the location of someone or 
something that might interest the characters. 
The characters are heading to a local tavern when 
they spot a wanted poster or a missing person poster 
(complete with the promise of a sizable reward). 
• Members of the local militia or city watch put out the 
word that a crime has been committed , and they're 
looking for potential witnesses and suspects. 
• The characters receive an anonymous letter that 
sheds light on a plot or impending event of which they 
were previously unaware. 
FORESHADOWING -------------------Foreshadowing is an exercise in subtlety, involving the 
delicate planting of seeds for future adventures. Not all 
foreshadowing bears fruit, particularly if the clues are 
too subtle or if events conspire to take your campaign 
in a new direction. The goal of foreshadowing is to hint 
at upcoming events and new threats in your campaign 
without making it obvious to players that you're telling 
them what the future holds. Here are a few examples: 
• An object worn or carried by an enemy has the symbol 
of a previously unknown organization engraved or 
written on it. 
A mad woman standing on a street corner spouts 
fragments of an ancient prophecy, while pointing a 
crooked finger at the characters. 
The king and queen announce the marriage of their 
son to the daughter of a neighboring monarch , but 
various factions oppose the union. Trouble is brewing. 
Bugbear scouts are making incursions into civilized 
lands and spying on settlements, as a prelude to a 
hobgoblin warlord's invasion. · 
• A puppet show in a market square predicts a tragic 
outcome if two noble houses on the cusp of declaring 
war on each other refuse to reconcile. 
NPC adventurers in a city are being murdered in a 
similar yet unusual manner, hinting at a future threat 
to the player characters . 
CAMPAIGN TRACKING 
Consiste nt details bring your campaign to life, and 
continuity helps players imagine that their characters 
are living in a real world. If the adventurers frequent 
a particular tavern, the staff, layout of the building, 
and decor shouldn't change much from one visit to the 
next. That said, changes can occur as a result of the 
characters' actions or of actions they learn about. When 
the adventurers kill a monster, it stays dead, unless 
someone raises it. When they remove treasure from 
a room, it doesn't reappear the next time they enter­
assuming it hasn't been stolen from them! If they leave a 
door open, it should Stay open until someone closes it. 
CHAPTER 6 I BETWEEN ADVENTURES No one's memory is infallible , so it pays to keep 
records. Jot notes directly on an adventure map to 
keep track of open doors, disarmed traps, and the like. 
Events beyond the scope of a single adventure are be 
recorded in a notebook dedicated to your campaign. 
Whether it's a physical book or an electronic file, such_ 
record is a great way to keep your notes organized . 
Your notebook might include any of the 
following elements. 
Campaign Planner. Write down the main story arc 
your campaign, and keep track of things that you hope 
appear in future adventures. Update it as the campaig r:. 
develops , adding ideas as they come to you. 
Character Notes. Write down the characters' 
backgrounds and goals, since these notes can help you 
design adventure content that provides opportunities ~ 
character development. 
Keep a running tally of the adventurers' classes and 
levels, as well as any quests and downtime activities 
they're engaged in. 
If the characters have a ship or stronghold, record iL 
name and whereabouts, as well as any hirelings in the 
characters' employ. 
Player Handouts. Keep a copy of all handouts 
you make for your players so that you don't have to 
remember their contents later. 
Adventure Log. Think of this log as an episode guide 
for your campaign. Summarize each game session 
or adventure to help you keep track of the unfolding 
campaign story. You can give your players access to thE 
log as well, or to an edited version stripped of your nor · 
and secrets. (The players might also keep their own 
record of adventures, which you can refer to if your ow­
log is incomplete.) 
NPC Nqtes. Record statistics and roleplaying not es 
for any NPC the characters interact with more than 
once. For example, your notes might differentiate 
important people in a town by their different voices, 
as well as their names, the places where they live 
and work, the names of their family members and 
associates, and maybe even a secret that each one 
of them has. 
Campaign Calendar. Your world feels more real to 
your players when the characters notice the passage of 
time. Note details such as the change of seasons and 
major holidays, and keep track of any important event 
that affect the larger story. 
Toolbox. Keep notes whenever you create or 
significantly alter a monster, magic item, or trap. Keep 
any maps, random dungeons , or encounters you create. 
This information ensures you won't repeat your work. 
and you'll be able to draw on this material later. 
RECURRING EXPENSES 
Besides the expenses associated with maintaining a 
particular lifestyle, adventurers might have additional 
drains on their adventuring income. Player characters 
who come into possession of property, own businesses. 
and employ hirelings must cover the expenses that 
accompany these ventures.

~ARRISONS 
::.:astles and keeps employ soldiers (use the veteran 
and guard statistics in the Monster Manual) to defend 
-em. Roadside inns, outposts and forts, palaces, and 
·emples rely on less-experienced defenders (use the 
;;uard statistics in the Monster Manual). These armed 
arriors make up the bulk of a property's skilled 
'lirelings. DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES 
The campaign benefits when characters have time 
between adventures to engage in other activities. 
Allowing days, weeks, or months to pass between 
adventures stretches the campaign over a longer period 
of time and helps to manage the characters' level 
progression, preventing them from gaining too much 
power too quickly. 
Allowing characters to pursue side interests between 
adventures also encourages players to become more 
invested in the campaign world. When a character owns 
a tavern in a village or spends time carousing with the 
locals, that character's player is more likely to respond 
to threats to the village and its inhabitants. 
As your campaign progresses, your players' 
characters will not only become more powerful but also 
more influential and invested in the world. They might 
be inclined to undertake projects that require more time 
between adventures, such as building and maintaining a 
strongho ld. As the party gains levels, you can add more 
downtime between adventures to give characters the 
time they need to pursue such interests. Whereas days 
or weeks might pass between low-level adventures , the 
amount of downtime between higher-level adventures 
might be measured in months or years. 
CHAPTER 6 I BETWEEN ADVENTURES 
MoRE Do-\\~TIME AcTn~TIE 
Chapter 8, ··Adventuring:· of the Player· Handbook 
describes a few downtime activities to fill the Yoid 
between adventures. Depending on the style of your 
campaign and the particular backgrounds and interests 
of the adventurers , you can make some or all of the 
following additional activities available as options. 
BUILDING A STRONGHOLD 
A character can spend time between adventures 
building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the 
character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies 
within a kingdom or similar domain, the character 
will need a royal charter (a legal document granting 
permission to oversee the estate in the name of the 
crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing 
custody of the land to the character for as long as he 
or she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a legal 
document that serves as proof of ownership) . Land can 
also be acquired by inheritanc e or other means. 
Royal charters and land grants are usually given by 
the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they 
can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A 
small estate might sell for as little as 100 gp or as much 
as 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more, 
if it can be bought at all. 
Once the estate is secured, a character needs access 
to building materials and laborers. The Building 
a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the 
stronghold (including materials and labor) and the 
amount of time it takes, provided that the character 
is using downtime to oversee construction. Work can 
continue while the character is away, but each day the 
character is away adds 3 days to the construction time. 
BUILDING A STRONGHOLD 
Construction Construction 
Stronghold Cost Time 
Abbey 50,000 gp 400 days 
Guildhall, town or city 5,000 gp 60 days 
Keep or small castle 50,000 gp 400 days 
Noble estate with manor 25,000 gp 150 days 
Outpost or fort 15,000 gp 100 days 
Palace or large castle 500,000 gp 1,200 days 
Temple 50,000 gp 400 days 
Tower, fortified 15,000 gp 100 days 
Trading post 5,000 gp 60 days 
CAROUSING 
Characters can spend their downtime engaged in a 
variety of hedonistic activities such as attending parties, 
binge drinking , gambling, or anything else that helps 
them cope with the perils they face on their adventures. 
A carousing character spends money as though 
maintaining a wealthy lifestyle (see chapter 5, 
"Equipment ," of the Player's Handbook). At the end of 
the period spent carousing , the player rolls percentile 
dice and adds the character 's level, then compares the 
total to the Carousing table to determine what happens 
to the character , or you choose.

CRAFTING A MAGIC ITEM 
Magic items are the DM's purview, so you decide how 
they fall into the party's possession. As an option, you 
can allow player characters to craft magic items. 
The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive 
task. To start, a character must have a formula that 
describes the construction of the item. The character 
must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must 
be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. 
Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum 
determined by the item's rarity, as shown in the Crafting 
Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character 
could create a wand of magic missiles (an uncommon 
item), as long as the character has spell slots and can 
cast magic missile. That same character could make 
a +1 weapon (another uncommon item), no particular 
spell required. 
You can decide that certain items also require special 
materials or locations to be created. For example, a 
character might need alchemist 's supplies to brew a 
particular potion, or the formula for a flame tongue 
might require that the weapon be forged with lava. 
(RAFTING MAGIC ITEMS 
Item Rarity Creation Cost Minimum Level 
Common 100 gp 3rd 
Uncommon 500 gp 3rd 
Rare 5,000 gp 6th 
Very rare 50,000 gp llth 
_egendary 500,000 gp 17th 
An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting 
_ Iagic Items table. A character engaged in the crafting 
of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments , 
-pending that amount for each day of work until the 
·oral cost is paid. The character is ass limed to work for 8 
._,ours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon 
;:nagic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to 
adjust the costs to better suit your campaign . 
If a spell will be produced by the item being created, 
-· e creator must expend one spell slot of the spell's 
,-eJ for each day of the creation process. The spell's 
::::~arerial components must also be at hand throughout 
· e process. If the spell normally consumes those 
;:omponents, they are consumed by the creation process. 
_ r the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as 
-c:ith a spell scroll, the components are consumed only 
_ ce by the process. Otherwise, the components are 
nsumed once each day of the item's creation. 
_ Iultiple characters can combine their efforts to 
::-eate a magic item if each of them meets the level 
:::-erequisite. Each character can contribute spells, spell 
"' r . and components, as long as everyone participates 
:.Jing the entire crafting process. Each character 
an contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent 
ping to craft the item. 
_ ·ormally, a character who undertakes this activity 
-~ares a magic item described in chapter 7, "Treasure." 
--_ our discretion, you can allow players to design their 
magic items, using the guidelines in chapter 9, 
~ungeon Master's Workshop." 
':hile crafting a magic item, a character can maintain 
odest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, 
-a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see 
-prer 5, "Equipment, " of the Player's Handbook). 
-__ .• ING RENOWN 
_ aracter can spend downtime improving his or 
_ renown within a particular organization (see 
-:;~now n" in chapter 1). Between adventures, a 
-racter undertakes minor tasks for the organization 
--' ocializes with its members. After pursuing these 
· ·iries for a combined number of days equal to his 
-er current renown multiplied by 10, the character's 
~m increases by 1. PERFORMING SACRED RITES 
A pious character can spend time between adventures 
performing sacred rites in a temple affiliated with a god 
he or she reveres. Between rites, the character spends 
time in meditation and prayer. 
A character who is a priest in the temple can lead 
these rites, which might include weddings, funerals, and 
ordinations. A layperson can offer sacrifices in a temple 
or assist a priest with a rite. 
A character who spends at least 10 days performing 
sacred rites gains inspiration (described in chapter 4 of 
the Player's Handbook) at the start of each day for the 
next 2d6 days. 
RUNNING A BUSINESS 
Adventurers can end up owning businesses that have 
nothing to do with delving into dungeons or saving the 
world. A character might inherit a smithy, or the party 
might be given a parcel of farmland or a tavern as a 
reward. If they hold on to the business, they might feel 
obliged to spend time between adventures maintaining 
the venture and making sure it runs smoothl y. 
A character rolls percentile dice and adds the number 
of days spent on this downtime activity (maximum 30), 
then compares the total to the Running a Business table 
to determine what happens. 
If the character is required to pay a cost as a result 
of rolling on this table but fails to do so, the business 
begins to fail. For each unpaid debt incurred in this 
manner, the character takes a -10 penalty to subsequent 
rolls made on this table.

SELLING MAGIC ITEMS 
Few people can afford to buy a magic item, and fewer 
still know how to find one. Adventurers are exceptional 
in this regard due to the nature of their profession. 
A character who comes into possession of a common , 
uncommon , rare, or very rare magic item that he or 
she wants to sell can spend downtime searching for a 
buyer. This downtime activity can be performed only in 
a city or another location where one can find wealthy 
CHAPTER 6 I BETWEEN ADVENTURES 
T29 
T30 individuals interested in buying magic items. Legendary 
magic items and priceless artifacts can't be sold during 
downtime. Finding someone to buy such an item can be 
the substance of an adventure or quest. 
For each salable item, the character makes a DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to find buyers. Another 
character can use his or her downtime to assist with the 
search, granting advantage on the checks. On a failed 
check, no buyer for the item is found after a search that 
lasts 10 days. On a successful check, a buyer for the 
item is found after a number of days based on the item's 
rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Item table. 
A character can attempt to find buyers for multiple 
magic items at once. Although this requires multiple 
Intelligence (Investigation) checks, the searches a~e 
occurring simultaneously , and the results of multiple 
failures or successes aren't added together. For 
example, if the character finds a buyer for a common 
magic item in 2 days and a buyer for an uncommon item 
in 5 days, but fails to find a buyer for a rare item up for 
grabs, the entire search takes 10 days. 
For each item a character wishes to sell, the player 
rolls percentile dice and consults the Selling a Magic 
Item table, applying a modifier based on the item's 
rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Items table. The 
character also makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check 
and adds that check's total to the roll. The subsequent 
total determines what a buyer offers to pay for the item. 
CHAPTER 6 I BETWEEN ADVENTURES You determine a buyer's identity. Buyers sometimes 
procure rare and very rare items through proxies to 
ensure that their identities remain unknown. If the 
buyer is shady, it's up to you whether the sale creates 
legal complications for the party later.

SOWING RUMORS 
waying public opinion can be an effective way to bring 
down a villain or elevate a friend. Spreading rumors 
is an efficient, if underhand ed, way to accomplish that 
goal. Well-placed rumors can increase the subject's 
-randing in a community or embroil someone in 
scandal. A rumor needs to be simple, concrete, and hard 
o disprove. An effective rumor also has to be believable , 
playing off what people want to believe about the person 
in question. 
Sowing a rumor about an individual or organization 
-equires a number of days depending on the size of the 
community , as shown in the Sowing Rumors table. In a 
own or city, the time spent must be continuous. If the 
character spreads a rumor for ten days, disappears on 
an adventure for another few days and then returns, 
rhe rumor fades away without the benefit of constant 
:-epetition. 
SOWING RUMORS 
Settlement Size 
Village 
Town 
City Time Required 
2d6 days 
4d6 days 
6d6 days 
The character must spend 1 gp per day to cover 
-e cost of drinks, social appearances, and the like. 
_ r the end of the time spent sowing the rumor, the 
-haracter must make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception 
r Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the 
community's prevailing attitude toward the subject shifts 
ne step toward friendly or hostile, as the character 
ishes. If the check fails, the rumor gains no traction, 
and further attempts to propagate it fail. 
Shifting a community 's general attitude toward 
a person or organization doesn't affect everyone in 
-e community. Individuals might hold to their own 
pinions, particularly if they have personal experience 
'"' dealing with the subject of the rumors. 
-RAINING TO GAIN LEVELS 
-a variant rule, you can require characters to spend 
:.owntime training or studying before they gain the 
oefits of a new level. If you choose this option, once a 
aracter has earned enough experience points to attain 
"' new level, he or she must train for a number of days 
: fore gaining any class features associated with the 
-w level. 
The training time required depends on the level to be 
,ained, as shown on the Training to Gain Levels table. 
e training cost is for the total training time. 
RAINING TO GAIN LEVELS

17th-20th 40 days 80 gp CREATING DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES 
Your players might be interested in pursuing downtime 
activities that aren't covered in this chapter or in 
the Player's Handbook. If you invent new downtime 
activities, remember the following: 
An activity should never negate the need or desire for 
characters to go on adventures. 
Activities that have a monetary cost associated with 
them provide opportunities for player characters to 
spend their hard-won treasure. 
Activities that reveal new adventur e hooks and 
previously unknown facts about your campaig n can 
help you foreshadow future events and conflicts. 
For an activity you expect a character to repeat 
with variable degrees of success, consider creating 
a random outcome table, modeled on the ones in 
this chapter. 
• If a character belongs to a class or has a proficiency or 
background that would make him or her well suited 
to a particular activity, consider granting a bonus to 
ability checks made by the character to complete that 
activity successfully. 
CHAPTER 6 I BETWEEN ADVENTURES 

CHAPTER 7: TREASURE 
DVENTURERS STRIVE FOR MANY THINGS , 
including glory, knowledge, and justice. 
Many adventurers also seek something more 
tangible: fortune. Strands of golden chains, 
stacks of platinum coins, bejeweled crowns, 
enameled scepters, bolts of silk cloth, and 
powerful magic items all wait to be seized or unearthed 
by intrepid, treasure-seeking adventurers. 
This chapter details magic items and the placement of 
treasure in an adventure, as well as special rewards that 
can be granted instead of or in addition to magic items 
and mundane treasure. 
TYPES OF TREASURE 
Treasure comes in many forms. 
Coins. The most basic type of treasure is money, 
including copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), electrum 
pieces (ep), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp). 
Fifty coins of any type weigh 1 pound. 
Gemstones. Gemstones are small, lightweight , and 
easily secured compared to their same value in coins. 
ee the "Gemstones" section for types of stones, gems, 
and jewels that can be found as treasure. 
Art Objects. Idols cast of solid gold, necklaces 
tudded with precious stones, paintings of ancient 
kings, bejeweled dishes-art objects include all these 
and more. See the "Art Objects" sectiori for types of 
decorative and valuable artworks that can be found 
as treasure. 
Magic Items. Types of magic items include armor, 
potions, scrolls, rings, rods, staffs, wands, weapons , 
and wondrous items. Magic items also have rarities: 
common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary. 
Intelligent monsters often use magic items in their 
possession, while others might hide them away to 
ensure they don't get lost or stolen. For example, if a 
hobgoblin tribe has a +llongsword and an alchemy jug 
in its treasure hoard, the tribe's warlord might wield the 
word, while the jug is kept somewhere safe. 
RANDOM TREASURE 
The following pages contain tables that you can use 
to randomly generate treasures carried by monsters , 
tashed in their lairs, or otherwise hidden away. The 
placement of treasure is left to your discretion. The key 
is to make sure the players feel rewarded for playing, 
and that their characters are rewarded for overcoming 
dangerous challenges. 
TREASURE TABLES 
Treasure can be randomly allocated based on a 
monster's challenge rating. There are tables for 
challenge rating 0-4, challenge rating 5-10, challenge 
rating 11-16, and challenge rating 17 and higher. Use 
these tables to randomly determine how much money 
an individual monster carries (the D&D equivalent of 
pocket change) or the amount of wealth found in a larger 
treasure hoard. 
' USING THE INDIVIDU AL TREASURE TABLES 
An Individual Treasure table helps you randomly 
determine how much treasure one creature carries on 
its person. If a monster has no interest in amassing 
treasure, you can use this table to determine the 
incidental treasure left behind by the monster's victims. 
Use the Individual Treasure table that corresponds to 
the monster's challenge rating. Roll a dlOO, and read the 
result across to determine how many coins of each type 
the monster carries. The table also includes the average 
result in parentheses , should you wish to forgo another 
roll and save time. To determin e the total amount of 
individual treasure for a group of similar creatures, you 
can save time by rolling once and multiplying the result 
by the number of creatures in the group. 
If it doesn't make sense for a monster to carry a large 
pile of coins, you can convert the coins into gemstones 
or art objects of equal value. 
USING THE TREASURE HOARD TABLES 
A Treasure Hoard table helps you randomly determine 
the contents of a large cache of treasure, the 
accumulated wealth of a large group of creatures (such 
as an ore tribe or a hobgoblin army), the belongings of 
a single powerful creature that likes to hoard treasure 
(such as a dragon), or the reward bestowed upon a party 
after completing a quest for a benefactor. You can also 
split up a treasure hoard so that the adventurers don't 
find or receive it all at once. 
When determining the contents of a hoard belonging 
to one monster, use the table that corresponds to that 
monster's challenge rating. When rolling to determine a 
treasure hoard belonging to a large group of monsters , 
use the challenge rating of the monster that leads the 
group. If the hoard belongs to no one, use the challenge 
rating of the monster that presides over the dungeon 
or lair you are stocking. If the hoard is a gift from a 
benefactor, use the challenge rating equal to the party's 
average level. 
Every treasure hoard contains a random number of 
coins, as shown at the top of each table. Roll a dlOO and 
consult the table to determine how many gemstones or 
art objects the hoard contains, if any. Use the same roll 
to determine whether the hoard contains magic items. 
As with the individual treasure tables, average values 
are given in parentheses. You can use an average value 
instead of rolling dice to save time. 
If a treasure hoard seems too small, you can roll 
multiple times on the table. Use this approach for 
monsters that are particularly fond of amassing 
treasure. Legendary creatures that accumulate treasure 
are wealthier than normal. Always roll at least twice on 
the appropriate table and add the results together. 
You can hand out as much or as little treasure as you 
want. Over the course of a typical campaign, a party 
finds treasure hoards amounting to seven rolls on the 
Challenge 0-4 table, eighteen rolls on the Challenge 
5-10 table, twelve rolls on the Challenge 11-16 table, 
and eight rolls on the Challenge 17+ table.

If a treasure hoard includes gemstones, you can use

Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered 
monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such 
items grant capabilities a character could rarely 
have otherwise, or they complement their owner's 
capabilities in wondrous ways. 
RARITY 
Each magic item has a rarity: common, uncommon, 
rare, very rare, or legendary. Common magic items, 
such as a potion of healing, are the most plentiful. Some 
legendary items, such as the apparatus of Kwalish, are 
unique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating 
the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were 
then gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms , and 
mishaps. Even uncommon items can't be easily created. 
Thus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities. 
Rarity provides a rough measure of an item's power 
relative to other magic items. Each rarity correspo nds 
to character level, as shown in the Magic Item Rarity . 
table. A character doesn't typically find a rare magic 
item, for example, until around 5th level. That said, 
rarity shouldn't get in the way of your campaign's story. 
If you want a ring of invisibility to fall into the hands of 
a 1st-level characte r, so be it. No doubt a great story will 
arise from that event. 
If your campaign allows for trade in magic items, 
rarity can also help you set prices for them. As the DM, 
you determine the value of an individual magic item 
based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in 
the Magic Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable 
item, such as a potion or scroll, is typically half the value 
of a permanent item of the same rarity. 
MAGIC ITEM RARITY 
Rarity Character Level Value 
Common 1st or higher 50-100 gp 
Uncommon 1st or higher 101-500 gp 
Rare 5th or higher 501-5,000 gp 
Very rare 11th or higher 5,001-50,000 gp 
Legendary 17th or higher 50,001+ gp 
BUYING AND SELLING 
Unless you decide your campaig n works otherwise, 
most magic items are so rare that they aren't available 
for purchase. Common items, such as a potion of 
healing, can be procured from an alchemist, herbalist, 
or spellcaster. Doing so is rarely as simple as walking 
into a shop and selecting an item from a shelf. The seller 
might ask for a service, rather than coin. 
In a large city with an academy of magic or a major 
temple, buying and selling magic items might be 
possible, at your discretion. If your world includes a 
large number of adventurers engaged in retrieving 
ancient magic items, trade in these items might be more 
common. Even so, it's likely to remain similar to the 
market for fine art in the real world, with invitation-only 
auctions and a tendency to attract thieves. 
Selling magic items is difficult in most D&D worlds 
primarily because of the challenge of finding a buyer. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
135 
Plenty of people might like to have a magic sword, but 
few of them can afford it. Those who can afford such an 
item usually have more practical things to spend on. See 
chapter 6, "Between Adventures, " for one way to handle 
selling magic items. 
In your campaign , magic items might be prevalent 
enough that adventurers can buy and sell them with 
some effort. Magic items might be for sale in bazaars or 
auction houses in fantastical locations, such as the City 
of Brass, the planar metropolis of Sigil, or even in more 
ordinary cities. Sale of magic items might be highly 
regulated , accompanied by a thriving black market. 
Artificers might craft items for use by military forces 
or adventurers , as they do in the world of Eberron. You 
might also allow characters to craft their own magic 
items, as discussed in chapters 6. 
IDENTIFYING A MAGIC ITEM 
Some magic items are indistinguishable from their 
nonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items 
display their magical nature conspicuously. Whatever a 
magic item's appearance, handling the item is enough to 
give a character a sense that something is extraordinary 
about it. Discovering a magic item's properties isn't 
automatic , however. 
The identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an 
item's properties. Alternatively , a character can focus 
on one magic item during a short rest, while being in

CP SP EP physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the 
character learns the item's properties, as well as how 
to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is 
enough to tell the taster what the potion does. 
Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its 
properties. The command word to activate a ring mighr 
be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design 
might suggest that it's a ring of feather falling. 
Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer 
hints about its properties. For example, if a character 
puts on a ring of jumping, you could say, "Your steps fee 
strangely springy." Perhaps the character then jumps 
up and down to see what happens. You then say the 
character jumps unexpectedly high. 
VARIANT: MORE DIFFICULT IDENTIFICATIO N 
If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique , 
consider removing the ability to identify the properties 
of a magic item during a short rest, and require the 
identify spell, experimentation , or both to reveal what a 
magic item does. 
ATTUNEMENT 
Some magic items require a creature to form a bond 
with them before their magical properties can be used. 
This bond is called attunement, and certain items 
have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, 
a creature must be a member of that class to attune to 
the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster

Magic rings offer an amazing array of powers to those 
lucky enough to find them. Unless a ring's description

similar digit, for the ring's magic to function. .YfAGIC ITEM CATEGORIES 
Each magic item belongs to a category: armor, RODS 
potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or 
"'"ondrous items. 
_-\RMOR A scepter or just a heavy cylinder, a magic rod is 
typically made of metal, wood, or bone. It's about 2 or 3 
feet long, 1 inch thick, and 2 to 5 pounds. 
SCROLLS -nless an armor's description says otherwise , armor 
must be worn for its magic to function. 
Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor 
;hey are, such as chain mail or plate. If a magic armor 
doesn't specify its armor type, you may choose the type 
or determine it randomly . Most scrolls are spells stored in written form, while 
POTIONS a few bear unique incantations that produce potent 
wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper, 
sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept 
safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. 
Different kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the 
category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs, 
water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and A scroll is a consumable magic item. Whatever the 
nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing 
that magic requires using an action to read the scroll. 
When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can't be

STAFFS 
A magic staff is about 5 or 6 feet long. Staffs vary widely 
in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter 
throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, 
some are made of wood, and others are composed of 
polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a 
staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds. 
Unless a staff's description says otherwise , a staff can 
be used as a quarterstaff. 
WANDS 
A magic wand is about 15 inches long and crafted of 
metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, 
stone, or some other material. 
WEAPONS 
Whether crafted for some fell purpose or forged to 
serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are 
coveted by many adventurers. 
Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon 
they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or 
VARIANT: MIXING POTIONS 
A character might drink one potion while still under the 
effects of another, or pour several potions into a single 
container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions 
can result in unpredictable interactions. 
When a character mixes two potions together, you can 
roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are 
combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining 
the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, 
reveal them only when they become evident.

00 The mixture creates a magical explosion, 
dealing 6d10 force damage to the mixer and 
1d10 force damage to each creature within 5 
feet of the mixer. 
The mixture becomes an ingested poison of 
the OM's choice. 
Both potions lose their effects. 
One potion loses its effect. 
Both potions work, but with their numerical 
effects and durations halved. A potion has no 
effect if it can't be halved in this way. 
Both potions work normally. 
The numerical effects and duration of one 
potion are doubled. If neither potion has 
anything to double in this way, they work 
normally. 
Only one potion works, but its effect is 
permanent. Choose the simplest effect to 
make permanent, or the one that seems 
the most fun. For example, a potion of 
healing might increase the drinker's hit point 
maximum by 4, or oil of etherealness might 
permanently trap the user in the Ethereal 
Plane. At your discretion, an appropriate 
spell, such as dispel magic or remove curse, 
might end this lasting effect. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE longbow. If a magic weapon doesn't specify its weapon 
type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly. 
WONDROUS ITEMS 
Wondrous items include worn items such as boots, 
belts, capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and 
decoration , such as amulets, brooches, and circlets. 
Bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns, musical 
instruments, and other objects also fall into this catch­
all category. 
WEARING AND WIELDING ITEMS 
Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing 
or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be 
donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, 
gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and 
rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a 
shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the 
shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand. 
In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn 
can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many 
magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or the: 
magically adjust themselves to the wearer. 
Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good 
reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain 
size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust. For 
example , armor made by the drow might fit elves only. 
VARIANT: SCROLL MISHAPS 
A creature who tries and fails to cast a spell from a spell scroll 
must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw. If the saving 
throw fails, roll on the Scroll Mishap table. 
SCROLL MISHAP 
d6 Result 
A surge of magical energy deals the caster 1d6 
force damage per level of the spell. 
2 The spell affects the caster or an ally 
(determined randomly) instead of the intended 
target, or it affects a random target nearby if the 
caster was the intended target. 
3 The spell affects a random location within the 
spell's range. 
4 
5 
6 The spell's effect is contrary to its normal one, 
but neither harmful nor beneficial. For instance, 
a fireball might produce an area of harmless 
cold. 
The caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect 
related to the spell. Such effects last only 
as long as the original spell's duration, or 
1d10 minutes for spells that take effect 
instantaneously. For example, a fireball might 
cause smoke to billow from the caster's ears for 
1d10 minutes. 
The spell activates after 1d12 hours. If the 
caster was the intended target, the spell takes 
effect normally. If the caster was not the 
intended target, the spell goes off in the general 
direction of the intended target, up to the spell's 
maximum range, ifthe target has moved away. 
Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized 
and dwarf-shaped characters. 
When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your 
discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. 
A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti 
with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots. 
MULTIPLE ITEMS OF THE SAME KIND 
Use common sense to determine whether more than 
one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A 
character can't normally wear more than one pair of 
footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets , one pair of 
bracers, one suit of armor, one item of head wear, and 
one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might 
be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or 
be able to layer two cloaks. 
PAIRED ITEMS 
Items that come in pairs-such as boots, bracers, 
gauntlets, and gloves-impart their benefits only if both 
items of the pair are worn. For example, a character 
wearing a boot of striding and springing on one foot and 
a boot of elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit 
from either item. 
ACTIVATING AN ITEM 
Activating some magic items requires a user to do 
omething special, such as holding the item and uttering 
a command word. The description of each item category 
or individual item details how an item is activated . 
Certain items use one or more of the following rules for 
their activation. 
If an item requires an action to activate, that action 
isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature 
such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to 
activate the item. 
COMMAND WORD 
A command word is a word or phrase that must be 
poken for an item to work. A magic item that requires 
a command word can't be activated in an area where 
ound is prevented, as in the area of the silence spell. 
CONSUMABLES 
Some items are used up when they are activated. A 
potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied 
to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is 
read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic. 
MAGIC ITEM FORMULAS 
A magic item formula explains how to make a particular 
magic item. Such a formula can be an excellent reward if you 
allow player characters to craft magic items, as explained in 
chapter 6, "Between Adventures. " 
You can award a formula in place of a magic item. Usually 
written in a book or on a scroll, a formula is one step rarer 
than the item it allows a character to create. For example, 
the formula for a common magic item is uncommon . No 
formulas exist for legendary items. 
If the creation of magic items is commonplace in your 
campaign, a formula can have a rarity that matches the 
rarity of the item it allows a character to create. Formulas for 
common and uncommon items might even be for sale, each 
with a cost double that of its magic item. SPELLS 
Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from 
the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell 
level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and 
requires no components, unless the item's description 
says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, 
range, and duration , and the user of the item must 
concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many 
items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell 
and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. 
Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing 
the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell. 
A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require 
you to use your own spellcasting ability when you 
cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one 
spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with 
the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability-perhaps 
you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature-your 
spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your 
proficiency bonus does apply. 
CHARGES 
Some magic items have charges that must be expended 
to activate their properties. The number of charges an 
item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell 
is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. 
Additionally , when an item regains charges, the creature 
attuned to it learns how many charges it regained. 
MAGIC ITEM RESILIENCE 
Most magic items are objects of extraordinary 
artisanship. Thanks to a combination of careful crafting 
and magical reinforcement , a magic item is at least as 
durable as a nonmagical item of its kind. Most magic 
items, other than potions and scrolls, have resistance 
to all damage. Artifacts are practically indestructible , 
requiring extraordinary measures to destroy. 
SPECIAL FEATURES 
You can add distinctiveness to a magic item by thinking 
about its backstory. Who made the item? Is anything 
unusual about its construction? Why was it made, and 
how was it originally used? What minor magical quirks 
set it apart from other items of its kind? Answering 
these questions can help turn a generic magic item, 
such as a +llongsword , into a more flavorful discovery. 
The tables that follow can help you come up with 
answers. Roll on as many of these tables as you like. 
Some of the table entries make more sense for certain 
items than for others. Some magic items are made 
only by certain kinds of creatures , for instance; a cloak 
of elvenkind is made by elves, rather than dwarves. If 
you roll something that doesn't make sense, roll again, 
choose a more appropriate entry, or use the rolled detail 
as inspiration to make up your own. 
VARIANT: WANDS THAT DoN'T RECHARGE 
A typical wand has expendable charges. If you'd like wands to 
be a limited resource, you can make some of them incapable 
of regaining charges. Consider increasing the base number of 
charges in such a wand, to a maximum of25 charges. These 
charges are never regained once they're expended.

12 Minor Property 
Song Craft. Whenever this item is struck or is used

ancient song. 
Strange Material. The item was created from

the wearer could make a red robe appear blue, or

item reverts to its true appearance when no one is 
carrying or wearing it. 
Roll twice, rerolling any additional 20s.

alters its appearance in slight ways. The bearer has

creature who listens carefully to the item might 
learn something useful. 
Painful. The bearer experiences a harmless flash of 
pain when using the item.

when in contact with the item, and continues to

magic item's description gives the item's name, its 
category, its rarity, and its magical properties. 
ADAMANTINE ARMOR 
Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon 
This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one 
of the hardest substances in existence. While you're 
wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a 
normal hit. 
ALCHEMY jUG 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon 
of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. 
Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when 
it is shaken, even if the jug is empty. 
You can use an action and name one liquid from the 
table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen 
liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action 
and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The 
maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends 
on the liquid you named. 
Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce 
a different one, or more of one that has reached its 
maximum, until the next dawn. 
Liquid Max Amount Liquid Max Amount

already 19 or higher. 
AMULET OF PROOF AGAINST DETECTION

While wearing this amulet, you are hidden from 
divination magic. You can't be targeted by such magic or 
perceived through magical scrying sensors. 
AMULET OF THE PLANES 
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) 
While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to 
name a location that you are familiar with on another 
plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligen ce 
check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shift 
spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object 
within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. 
Roll a dlOO. On a 1-60, you travel to a random location 
on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a 
randomly determined plane of existence.

While holding this shield, you can speak its command 
word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield 
leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect 
you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. 
The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you 
use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are 
incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the 
ground or into your hand if you have one free. 
APPARATUS OF KWALISH 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel 
weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, 
which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a 
hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or 
smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in 
a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to 
move either up or down. When certain levers are used, 
the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. 
The apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the 
following statistics : 
Armor Class: 20 
Hit Points: 200 
Speed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and 
tail aren't extended) 
Damage Immunities: poison, psychic 
To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. 
While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment 
is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds 
enough air for 10 hours of breathing , divided by the 
number of breathing creatures inside. 
The apparatus floats on water. It can also go 
underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the 
vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute 
from pressure . APPARATUS OF KWALISH 
A creature in the compartm ent can use an action to 
move as many as two of the apparatus 's levers up or 
down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral 
position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as 
shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.

CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
ARMOR OF 
CoLD RESISTANcE 
ARMOR , +1, +2, OR +3 ARMO R OF 
INVULNERA BILITY 
Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2), 
or legendary(+ 3) 
You have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The 
bonus is determined by its rarity. 
ARMOR OF INVULNERABILITY 
Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement) 
You have resistance to nonmagical damage while you 
wear this armor. Additionally , you can use an action to 
make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 
minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. 
Once this special action is used, it can't be used again 
until the next dawn. 
ARMOR OF RESISTANCE 
Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires 
attunement) 
You have resistance to one type of damage while 
you wear this armor. The DM chooses the type or 
determines it randomly from the options below. 
dlO Damage Type dlO Damage Type 
Acid 6 Necrotic 
2 Cold 7 Poison 
3 Fire 8 Psychic 
4 Force 9 Radiant 
5 Lightning 10 Thunder 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE ARMOR OF VULNERABILITY 
Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement) 
While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one 
of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, 
or slashing. The DM chooses the type or determines 
it randomly. 
Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed 
only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you 
attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you 
are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic: 
removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed 
you have vulnerability to two of the three damage type 
associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants 
resistance). 
ARROW-CATCHING SHIELD 
Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement) 
You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while 
you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the 
shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an 
attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 
5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the 
target of the attack instead. 
ARROW OF SLAYING 
Weapon (arrow), very rare 
An arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay 
a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused 
than others; for example, there are both arrows of 
dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a 
creature belonging to the type, race, or group associate d 
with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, 
the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving 
throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed 
save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one. 
Once an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a 
creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow. 
Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, 
such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though 
arrows are most common. 
BAG OF BEANS 
Wondrous item, rare 
Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The 
bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean 
it contains. 
If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they 
explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. 
Each creature in the area, including you, must make a 
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage 
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successfu l 
one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that 
aren't being worn or carried. 
If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or 
sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 
1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. 
The DM can choose an effect from the following table, 
determine it randomly, or create an effect. 
BAG OF 110LOING 
dlOO Effect 
01 Sd4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a 
toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater 
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw or take Sd6 poison damage and become 
poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater 
gains Sd6 temporary hit points for 1 hour. 
2-10 A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, 
tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (DM's choice) 30 feet into 
the air for 1 d12 rounds. 
1-20 A treant sprouts (see the Monster Manual for 
statistics) . There's a 50 percent chance that the 
treant is chaotic evil and attacks. 
21-30 An animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness 
rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you 
leave it and others come near, it describes you 
as the most heinous of villains and directs the 
newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on 
the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows 
where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 
24 hours. 
31-40 A campfire with blue Aames springs forth and 
burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished) . 
41-50 1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout (see the Monster Manual 
for statistics). 
51-60 1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever 
a toad is touched , it transforms into a Large or 
smaller monster of the DM's choice. The monster 
remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a putT of 
bright pink smoke. 
61-70 A hungry bulette (see the Monster Manual for 
statistics) burrows up and attacks. 
71-80 A fruit tree grows. It has 1 d1 0 + 20 fruit, 1 d8 of 
which act as randomly determined magic potions, 
while one acts as an ingested poison of the DM's 
choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit 
remains, retaining any magic for 30 days. 
81-90 A nest of1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature 
that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution 
saving throw. On a successful save, a creature 
permanent ly increases its lowest ability score by 1, 
randomly choosing among equally low scores. On 
a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage 
from an internal magical explosion . 
91-99 A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts 
upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing 
a mummy lord (see the Monster Manual for 
statistics) . The pyramid is treated as the mummy 
lord's lair, and its sarcophagus contains treasure of 
the DM's choice. 
00 A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height 
of the DM's choice. The top leads where the DM 
chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant's 
castle, or a different plane of existence . BAG OF 
DEVOURING 
BAG OF DEVOURING 
Wondrous item, very rare 
This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a 
feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. 
Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice. 
The extradimensional creature attached to the bag 
can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or 
vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured 
and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed 
in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, 
there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled 
inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its 
action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength 
check. Another creature can use its action to reach into 
the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful 
DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the 
bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag 
is devoured , its body destroyed . 
Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which 
can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once 
each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and 
spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM 
determines the time and plane. 
If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed , and 
anything contained within it is transported to a random 
location on the Astral Plane. 
BAG OF HOLDING 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This bag has an interior space considerably larger 
than its outside dimensions , roughly 2 feet in diameter 
at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 
500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. 
The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. 
Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. 
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures 
and is destroyed , and its contents are scattered in the 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 153 
154 Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents 
spill forth, unharmed , but the bag must be put right 
before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside 
the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal 
to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 
minute), after which time they begin to suffocate. 
Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional 
space created by a Heward's handy haversack , portable 
hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and 
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it 
to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then 
closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened. 
BAG OF TRICKS 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, 
appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, 
reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag 
weighs 1/2 pound. 
You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the 
bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, 
it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling 
a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the 
bag's color. See the Monster Manual for the creature's 
statistics. 
The creature is friendly to you and your companions, 
and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to 
command how the creature moves and what action it 
takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such 
as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, 
the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. 
Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the 
bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in 
diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 beads 
of force are found together. 
You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 
feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. 
Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead 
landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw 
or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent 
force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature 
that failed the save and is completely within the area is 
trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded 
on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed 
BooTs OF 
ELVENKINO 
away from the center of the sphere until they are no 
longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through 
the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can. 
An enclosed creature can use its action to push 
against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half 
the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked 
up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, 
regardless of the weight of creatures inside. 
BELT OF DWARVENKIND 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 
While wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits: 
Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a 
maximum of 20. 
You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks 
made to interact with dwarves. 
In addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50 
percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard 
if you're capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker 
beard if you already have one. 
If you aren't a dwarf, you gain the following additional 
benefits while wearing the belt: 
You have advantage on saving throws against poison, 
and you have resistance against poison damage. 
You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. 
You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish. 
BELT OF GIANT STRENGTH 
Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement) 
While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to 
a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already 
equal to or greater than the belt's score, the item has no 
effect on you. 
Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and 
having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The belt of stone giant strength and the belt of frost giant 
strength look different, but they have the same effect.

and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a 
battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors. 
with a ladder running along one wall to connect them.

the air and speak the command word. When you do so,

-word uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to 
damage rolls.

cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet 
of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause 
rhe sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it. 
After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it

contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.

out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start 
of your next turn. Choose from the following options: 
"Stream" produces 1 gallon of water. 
"Fountain" produces 5 gallons of water. 
• "Geyser" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes 
forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a 
bonus action while holding the decanter , you can aim 
the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of 
you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength 
saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall 
prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object

more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked 
over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you. 
DECK OF ILLUSIONS 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full 
deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually 
missing 1d20-1 cards. 
The magic of the deck functions only if cards are 
drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing 
cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to 
draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the 
ground at a point within 30 feet of you. 
An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the 
thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory 
creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and 
behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the 
Monster Manual), except that it can do no harm. While 
you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and 
can see it, you can use an action to move it magically 
anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical 
interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an 
illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who

card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

DECK OF MANY THINGS 
Wondrous item, legendary 
Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains 
a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 
percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the 
rest have twenty-two. 
Before you draw a card, you must declare how many 
cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly 
(you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate 
the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number 
have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card 
from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw 
each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. 
If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take 
effect all at once. 
Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unle s~ 
the card is the Fool or the jester, the card reappears 
in the deck, making it possible to draw the same 
card twice.

A QUESTION OF ENMITY 
Two of the cards in a deck of many things can earn a character 
the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the 
enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's 
malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the 
fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should 
clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before 
being able to confront the devil itself. 
In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and 
should come from someone thought to be a friend or an 
ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically 
appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the 
adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.

allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never

Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The 
devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring 
your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity 
lasts until either you or the devil dies. 
Fool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw 
from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your 
declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you

spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of

resistance to fire damage. 
As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can 
use an action and speak a command word to cause 
one weapon you are holding to burst into flames.

harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with liELM OF BRILLIANCE

an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you 
use a bonus action to speak the command word again

Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire 
damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a 
spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from 
its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the

pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space.

not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large 
central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds 
of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, 
regardless of its contents. 
Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal 
rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item 
from the haversack requires you to use an action. When 
you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item 
is always magically on top. 
The haversack has a few limitations. If it is 
overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE iiEWARO'S liANDY liAVERSACK 
haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack 
is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although 
an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the 
haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, 
unharmed , and the haversack must be put right before 
it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed 
within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 
10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. 
Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional 
space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or 
similar item instantly destroys both items and opens 
a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where 
the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature 
within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it and 
deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. 
The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can·I 
be reopened.

have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius o:

Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature 
rakes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. 
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much 
damage and isn't deafened . Creatures and objects made 
of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving 
throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.

of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 
10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.

four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar 
creature , they allow the creature to move normally

An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledg e 
and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of 
Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of 
shape and color. 
When you use an action to toss one of these stones 
into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance 
of ld3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, 
another creature must use an action to grasp or net 
the stone to separate it from you, either by making a 
successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 
24 Dexterity (Acrobati cs) check. You can use an action 
to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect. 
CLI LYRE 
A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all 
damage. It is considered to be an object that is being 
worn while it orbits your head. 
Absorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender 
ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to 
cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you 
can see and targeting only you. 
Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it 
burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you 
are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the 
number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't 
cancel it.

Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled 
lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can 
use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower 
cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you. 
Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it 
burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you 
are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the 
number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't 
cancel it.

spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The 
stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. 
When found, it contains ld4 - 1 levels of stored spells 
chosen by the DM. 
Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level 
into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The 
spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. 
If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended 
without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell 
determines how much space it uses. 
While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any 
spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save 
DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the 
original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the louN STONES 
IRON BANDS OF BILARRO 
spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in

the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or 
smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As 
the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle 
of metal bands. 
Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal 
to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. 
On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus 
action to speak the command word again to release it. 
Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands 
to contract and become a sphere once more. 
A creature , including the one restrained, can use an 
action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the 
iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed , and 
the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any 
further attempts made by that creature automatically 
fail until 24 hours have elapsed. 
Once the bands are used, they can't be used again 
until the next dawn.

IRON FLASK 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an 
action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a 
creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the 
target is native to a plane of existence other than the one 
you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom 
saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has 
been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the 
saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the 
flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature 
at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to 
breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age. 
You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper 
and release the creature the flask contains. The creature 
is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and 
obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no 
commands or give it a command that is likely to result 
in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no 
actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in 
accordance with its normal disposition and alignment. 
An identify spell reveals that a creature is inside 
the flask, but the only way to determine the type of 
creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle 
might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or 
determined randomly.

you use an action to speak the command word again. 
Any creature other than you that sees its reflection 
in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must 
succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be 
trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in 
one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This 
saving throw is made with advantage if the creature 
knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on 
the saving throw automatically. 
An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled 
with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures 
trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't 
need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within 
a cell can escape using magic that permits planar 
travel. Otherwis e, the creature is confined to the cell 
until freed. MIRROR OF

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve 
extradimensional cells are already occupied , the mirror 
frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate 
the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an 
unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing 
away from it. If the mirror is shattered , all creatures 
it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied 
spaces near it. 
While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an 
action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or 
call out a particular cell by number. The creature named 
or contained in the named cell appears as an image 
on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then 
communicate normally. 
In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a 
second command word and free one creature trapped 
in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with 
its possessions , in the unoccupied space nearest to the 
mirror and facing away from it. 
MITHRAL ARMOR 
Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon 
Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt 
or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. I£ the 
armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement , the 
mithral version of the armor doesn't.

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
While wearing this necklace , you can breathe normally

feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the 
bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15

NECKLACE OF PRAYER BEADS 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, 
druid, or paladin) 
This necklace has ld4 + 2 magic beads made from 
aquamarine , black pearl, or topaz. It also has many 
nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, 
bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a 
magic bead is removed from the necklace , that bead 
loses its magic. 
Six types of magic beads exist. The DM decides the 
type of each bead on the necklace or determines it 
randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of 
the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the 
necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast 
from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a 
save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, 
that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.

NINE LIVES STEALER 
Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement) 
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. 
The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical 
hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, 
it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or 
be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its 
body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword 
loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword 
has no charges remaining, it loses this property. 
NOLZUR'S MARVELOUS PIGMENTS 
Wondrous item, very rare 
Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box 
with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments 
allow you to create three-dimensional objects by 
painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from 
the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate 
on its image. 
Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square 
feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects 
or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, 
cells, rooms, or weapons -that are up to 10,000 cubic 
feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet. 
When you complete the painting, the object or terrain 
feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. 
Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door 
that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit 
on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against 
the total area of objects you create. 
Nothing created by the pigments can have a value 
greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks 
authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from 
paste, bone, or some other worthless material. 
If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, 
the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you 
complete the painting, doing no harm to anything . 
0ATHBOW 
Weapon (longbow) , very rare (requires attunement) 
When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in 
Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies. " When you use 
this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a 
command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have 
wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your 
sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. 
You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. 
When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new 
one after the next dawn. 
When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon 
against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the 
roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, 
other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage 
due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy 
takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage. 
While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage 
on attack rolls with all other weapons. 
OIL OF ETHEREALNESS 
Potion, rare 
Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its 
container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a 
Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment 
it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE

takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the 
effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour. 
OIL OF SHARPNESS 
Potion, very rare 
This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin 
silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing 
weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing 
ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 
hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls. 
OIL OF SLIPPERINESS 
Potion, uncommon 
This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the 
container , but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can 
cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the 
equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional 
vial is required for each size category above Medium). 
Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature 
then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell 
for 8 hours. 
Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as 
an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating 
the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours. 
PEARL OF PowER 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a 
spellcaster) 
You can use an action to speak this pearl's command 
word and regain one expended spell slot of up to 3rd 
level. Once you have used the pearl, it can't be used 
again until the next dawn. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE PERIAPT OF HEALTH 
Wondrous item, uncommon PERIAPT 01' liEAL TH

disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed you 
while you wear the pendant. 
PERIAPT OF PROOF AGAINST POISON

pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no effect on 
you. You are immune to the poisoned condition and ha\"e 
immunity to poison damage. 
PERIAPT OF WOUND CLOSURE 
Wondrous item,· uncommon (requires attunement) 
While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever 
you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, 
whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double 
the number of hit points it restores. 
PHILTER OF LOVE 
Potion, uncommon 
The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes 
after drinking this philter, you become charmed by 
that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species 
and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it 
as your true love while you are charmed. This potion's 
rose-hued , effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-mis 
bubble shaped like a heart. 
PIPES OF liAUNTING 
PIPES OF HAUNTING 
Wondrous item, uncommon PiPES OF THE SEWERS 
You must be proficient with wind instruments to use 
these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action 
to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, 
spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you 
that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom 
saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. 
If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile 
toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. 
A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a 
success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw 
is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The 
pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. 
PIPES OF THE SEWERS 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
You must be proficient with wind instruments to use 
these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary 
rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will 
not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. 
The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as 
an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 
3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats (see the 
Monster Manual for statistics) with each expended 
charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile 
of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by 
the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, 
the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the 
music by the shortest available route but aren't under 
your control otherwise. The pipes regain ld3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another 
creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you 
are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check 
contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose 
the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would 
and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 
24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed 
by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and 
your companions for as long as you continue to play the 
pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys 
your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly 
swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. 
If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the 
pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and 
the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be 
swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. 
PLATE ARMOR OF ETHEREALNESS 
Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement) 
While you're wearing this armor, you can speak its 
command word as an action to gain the effect of the 
etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until 
you remove the armor or use an action to speak the 
command word again. This property of the armor can't 
be used again until the next dawn. 
PORTABLE HOLE 
Wondrous item, rare 
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the 
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular 
sheet 6 feet in diameter. 
You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and 
place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the 
portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 
feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 

on a different plane, so it can't be u ed to create open 
passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can 
exit the hole by climbing out of it. 
You can use an action to close a portable hole by 
taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. 
Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or 
objects within remain in the extradim ensional space. o 
matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing. 
If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's 
extradimensional space can use an action to make 
a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the 
creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of 
the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing 
creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up 
to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate . 
Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional 
space created by a bag of holding, Heward's handy 
haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items 
and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it 
and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. 
The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't 
be reopened. 
POTION OF ANIMAL FRIENDSHIP 
Potion, uncommon 
When you drink this potion, you can cast the animal

POTION OF DIMINUTION 
Potion, rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" 
effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no 
concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid 
continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands 
to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle 
fails to interrupt this process. 
POTION OF FIRE BREATH 
Potion, uncommon 
After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to 
exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 
lire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on 
a successful one. The effect t;nds after you exhale the 
lire three times or when 1 hour has passed. 
This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the 
top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened. 
POTION OF FLYING 
Potion, very rare 
When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed 
equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover.

has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.

Potion, rare

and pours like water.

Potion, rarity varies

changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the 
score (see the table below). The potion has no effect 
on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than 
that score. 
This potion's transpar ent liquid has floating in it a 
sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriat e type.

POTION OF HEALING 
Potion, rarity varies 
You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The 
number of hit points depends on the potion's rarity, as 
shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its

POTION OF INVISIBILITY 
Potion, very rare 
This potion's container looks empty but feels as though 
it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible 
for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with 
you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell. 
POTION OF INVULNERABILITY

resistance to all damage. The potion's syrupy liquid 
looks like liquified iron.

Potion, very rare 
When you drink this potion, your physical age is 
reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. 
Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, 
there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead 
age by 1d6 + 6 years. Suspended in this amber liquid

and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. 
These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.

purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it. 
POTION OF POISON 
Potion, uncommon 
This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of 
healing or other beneficial potion. However , it is actpally 
poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell 
reveals its true nature. 
If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you 
must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or 
be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you 
are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. 
At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the 
saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage 
you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. 
The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.

21-35 Bird 
36-50 Fan dl 00 Feather Token 
51-65 Swan boat 
66-90 Tree 
91-00 Whip 
Anchor. You can use an action to touch the token to a 
boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be 
moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel 
again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token 
disappears. 
Bird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet 
into the air. The token disappears and an enormous , 
multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the 
statistics of a roc (see the Monster Manual), but it obeys 
your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry 
up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed 
(16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day. 
with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,00G 
pounds at half that speed. The bird disappea rs after 
flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 
hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action. 
Fan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action 
to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token 
disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The 
fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the 
sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per 
hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action. 
Swan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token 
to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token 
disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped 
like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled 
and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. 
You can use an action while on the boat to command it 
to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry 
up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large 
creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a 
Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 
hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as 
an action. 
Tree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You 
can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space 
on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place 
a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree 
is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its 
branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. 
Whip. You can use an action to throw the token to a 
point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears , and a 
floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus 
action to make a melee spell attack against a creature 
within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. 
On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage. 
As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the 
whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a 
creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 
hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you 
are incapacitated or die.

on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 
hit points. It then returns to its home plane. 
While summoned , the djinni is friendly to you and 
your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no 
matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, 
the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no 
other actions. 
After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again 
for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the 
djinni dies.

and the spell's energy-not the spell itself -is stored in 
the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when 
it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels 
of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod 
absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you 
are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod 
has no effect on that spell.

many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the 
course of its existence, and how many levels of spell 
energy it currently has stored. 
If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can

you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots

radius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes, this barrier 
prevents creatures of the specified type from entering or 
affecting anything within the cylinder. 
The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on 
you. However, if you move in such a way that a creature 
of the specified type would be inside the cylinder, the 
effect ends. 
A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by 
using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. 
On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by 
the barrier. 
SENDING STONES 
Wondrous item, uncommon 
Sending stones come in pairs, with each smooth stone 
carved to match the other so the pairing is easily 
recognized. While you touch one stone, you can use an 
action to cast the sending spell from it. The target is the 
bearer of the other stone. If no creature bears the other 
stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone 
and don't cast the spell. 
Once sending is cast through the stones, they can't be 
used again until the next dawn. If one of the stones in a 
pair is destroyed , the other one becomes nonmagical.

causes you to become the target instead. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE SLIPPERS OF SPIDER CLIMBING 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 
While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, 
down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down 
along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have 
a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Howeve­
the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a 
slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil. 
SOVEREIGN GLUE 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This viscous, milky-white substance can form a 
permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. 
It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated 
inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a containe; 
contains 1d6 + 1 ounces. 
One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square 
surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has 
done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the 
application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness. -
with a wish spell. 
SPELL SCROLL 
Scroll, varies 
A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written -
a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spellli 
you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spe 
without having to provide any of the spell's compone n " 
Otherwise , the scroll is unintelligible. 
If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher 
level than you can normally cast, you must make an 
ability check using your spellcasting ability to determ· 
whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + 
spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears fro­
the scroll with no other effect. 
Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, 
and the scroll itself crumbles to dust. 
The level of the spell on the scroll determines the 
spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as th 
scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

SPHERE OF ANNIH ILATION 
Wondrous item, legendary 
This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the 
multiverse , hovering in space and stabilized by a 
magical field surrounding it. 
The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through 
and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the 
exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage 
from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the 
sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere 
but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 
force damage. 
The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. 
If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, 
you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one 
direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 
5 x your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a 
failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature 
whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 
13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 
4d10 force damage. 
If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another 
creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) 
check contested by the other creature's Intelligence 
(Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control 
of the sphere and can levitate it as normal. 
If the sphere comes into contact with a planar 
portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an 
extradimensional space, such as that within a portable 
hole, the DM determines randomly what happens , using 
the following table. 
dlOO Result 
01-50 The sphere is destroyed. 
51-85 The sphere moves through the portal or into the 
extradimensional space.

random plane of existence.

CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE SENTIENT MAGIC ITEMS 
Some magic items possess sentience and personali ty. 
Such an item might be possessed , haunted by the spirr· 
of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic 
used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a 
character , complete with personality quirks, ideals, 
bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might 
be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn 
in the side. 
Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of ite -
can manifest sentience , but consumable items such a_ 
potions and scrolls are never sentient. 
Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the 
DM's control. Any activated property of the item is 
under the item's control, not its wielder's. As long as 
the wielder maintains a good relationship with the 
item, the wielder can access those properties normall_­
If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress 
its activated properties or even turn them against 
the wielder. 
CREATING SENTIENT MAGIC ITEMS 
When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you 
create the item's persona in the same way you would 
create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here. 
ABILITIES 
A sentient magic item has Intelligence , Wisdom, and 
Charisma scores. You can choose the item's abilities 
or determine them randomly. To determine them 
randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest r 
and totaling the rest. 
COMMUNICATION 
A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either 
by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts 
telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how· 
communicates or roll on the following table. 
dlOO Communication 
01-60 The item communicates by transmitting emotion 
to the creature carrying or wielding it. 
61-90 The item can speak, read, and understand one or 
more languages. 
91-00 The item can speak, read, and understand one 
SENSES or more languages. In addition, the item can 
communicate telepathically with any character tha 
carries or wields it. 
With sentience comes awareness . A sentient item can 
perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can 
choose its senses or roll on the following table. 
d4 
2 
3 
4 Senses 
Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet. 
Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet 
Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet. 
Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet. 

216 ALIGNMENT 
A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or 
nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick 
an alignment or roll on the following table. 
dlOO Alignment dlOO Alignment 
01-15 Lawful good 74-85 Chaotic neutral 
16-35 Neutral good 86-89 Lawful evil 
36-50 Chaotic good 90-96 Neutral evil 
51-63 Lawful neutral 97-00 Chaotic evil 
64-73 Neutral 
CHARACTERISTICS 
Use the information on creating NPCs in chapter 4 
to develop a sentient item's mannerisms, personality 
traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. You can also draw on the 
"Special Features " section earlier in this chapter. 
If you determine these characteristics randomly , 
ignore or adapt any result that doesn't make sense 
for an inanimate object. You can reroll until you get a 
result you like. 
SPECIAL PURPOSE 
You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, 
perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the 
wielder's use of the item aligns with that special 
purpose, the item remains cooperative . Deviating from 
this course might cause conflict between the wielder 
and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent 
the use of its activated properties . You can pick a special 
purpose or roll on the following table. 
dlO Purpose 
Aligned: The item seeks to defeat or destroy those 
of a diametrically opposed alignment . (Such an 
item is never neutral.) 
2 Bane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures 
of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers , 
trolls, or wizards. 
3 Protector: The item seeks to defend a particular 
race or kind of creature, such as elves or druids. 
4 Crusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or 
destroy the servants of a particular deity. 
5 Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants 
and interests of a particular deity. 
6 Destroyer: The item craves destruction and goads 
its user to fight arbitrarily. 
7 Glory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the 
greatest magic item in the world, by establishing 
its user as a famous or notorious figure. • 
8 Lore Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is 
determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or 
unravel a cryptic prophecy. 
9 Destiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its 
wielder have key roles to play in future events. 
10 Creator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and 
wants to understand why it was created. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE CONFLIC T 
A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its 
personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a 
manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, 
conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item 
makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's 
Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it make 
one or more of the following demands: 
The item insists on being carried or worn at all times 
The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything 
the item finds repugnant. 
• The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's 
goals to the exclusion of all other goals. 
The item demands to be given to someone else. 
If its wielder refuses to comply with the item's wishes 
the item can do any or all of the following: 
Make it impossibl e for its wielder to attune to it. 
Suppress one or more of its activated properties . 
Attempt to take control of its wielder. 
If a sentient item attempts to take control of its 
wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving 
throw, with a DC equal to 12 +the item's Charisma 
modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by 
item for ld12 hours. While charmed , the wielder mus 
try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes 
damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effe 
on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user 
succeeds or fails, the item can't use this power again 
until the next dawn. 
SAMPLE SENTIENT ITEMS 
The sentient weapons described here have storied 
histories. 
BLACKRAZOR 
Weapon (greats word), legendary (requires attunemenc 
by a creature of non-lawful alignment) 
Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain , 
Blackrazor shines like a piece of night sky filled with 
stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of 
cut obsidian. 
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. It has the following additio n~ 
properties. 
Devour Soul. Whenever you use it to reduce a 
creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature 
devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead .. -. 
creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackraz or 
can be restored to life only by a wish spell. 
When it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you 
temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit 
point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. 
As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep 
Blackrazor in hand, you have advantage on attack roll . 
saving throws, and ability checks. 
If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take ldlO 
necrotic damage and the target regains ldlO hit point 
If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, 
Blackrazor devours your soul. 
Soul Hunter. While you hold the weapon. you are 
aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 
60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also 
can't be charmed or frightened. 
Blackrazor can cast the haste spell on you once per 
day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains 
concentration on it so that you don't have to. 
Sentience. Blackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral 
weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and 
a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 120 feet. 
The weapon can speak, read, and understand 
Common, and can communicate with its wielder 
telepathica lly. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you 
are attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every 
language you know. 
Personality. Blackrazor speaks with an imperious 
tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed. 
The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't 
care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The 
word believes that all matter and energy sprang from 
a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. 
Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along. 
Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange 
kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked 
away under White Plume Mountain . It wants the three 
weapons to be united again and wielded together in 
combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm 
and finds Wave tedious. 
Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If 
the sword goes three days or more without consuming 
a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the 
next sunset. 
MOONBLADE 
Weapon (longs word), legendary (requires attunement by 
an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment) 
Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the 
most prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade. In 
ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one 
uch blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded 
from the world, their magic lost as family lines have 
become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their 
bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these 
weapons remain. 
A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The 
sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that 
person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can 
claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies 
dormant. It functions like a normallongsword until a 
worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power. 
Amoonb lade serves only one master at a time. The 
attunement process requires a special ritual in the 
throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated 
to the elven gods. 
A moon blade won't serve anyone it regards as 
craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and 
protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make 
ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with 
disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you 
become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or 
the weapon is destroyed. 
A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each 
master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune 
always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the 
first grants the moon blade an additiona l property. The 
DM chooses each property or determin es it randomly on 
the Moon Blade Properties table. 
MOONBLADE PROPERTIES 
d1 00 Property 
01-40 Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 
1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the moonblade 
already has a +3 bonus. 
41-80 The moonblade gains a randomly determined 
minor property (see "Special Features" earlier in 
this chapter). 
81-82 The moonblade gains the finesse property . 
83-84 The moonblade gains the thrown property (range 
20/60 feet). 
85-86 The moonblade functions as a defender. 
87-90 The moon blade scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 
or 20. 
91-92 When you hit with an attack using the moon blade, 
the attack an extra 1d6 slashing damage. 
93-94 When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as 
dragon, fiend, or undead) with the moonblade, the 
target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these 
types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. 
95-96 You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade 
to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and 
is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw 
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect 
on itself on a success. This property can't be used 
again until you take a short rest while attuned to 
the weapon. 
97-98 The moonblade functions as a ring of spell storing. 
99 You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, 
provided that you don't already have one serving 
you. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied 
space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics 
for a shadow from the Monster Manual, except it 
is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, 
and doesn't create new shadows. You control 
this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It 
remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss 
it as an action. 
00 The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword. 
Sentience. A moon blade is a sentient neutral good 
weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and 
a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 120 feet. 
The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, 
sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
2T7 
when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. 
It can communicate more explicitly , through visions or 
dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep. 
Personality. Every moonblade seeks the advancement 
of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, 
music, and life are all part of this purpose. 
The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to 
serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its 
ideals, its loyalty is absolute. 
If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once 
it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that 
person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of 
elven ideals. 
WAVE 
Weapon (trident), legendary (requires attunement by a 
creature that worships a god of the sea) 
Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, this 
trident is an exquisite weapon engraved with images 
of waves, shells, and sea creatures. Although you must 
worship a god of the sea to attune to this weapon, Wave 
happily accepts new converts. 
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. If you score a critical hit with it, 
the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its 
hit point maximum. 
The weapon also functions as a trident offish 
command and a weapon of warning. It can confer the 
benefit of a cap of water breathing while you hold it, and 
you can use it as a cube of force by choosing the effect, 
instead of pressing cube sides to select it. 
Sentience . Wave is a sentient weapon of neutral 
alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, 
and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out 
to a range of 120 feet. 
The weapon communicates telepathically with its 
wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It 
can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a speak 
with animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder 
in the conversation. 
Personality. When it grows restless, Wave has a habit 
of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred 
hymns of the sea gods. 
Wave zealously desires to convert mortals to the 
worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the 
faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to 
further the weapon's objectives in the world. 
The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the 
place where it was forged, a desolate island called 
Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm 
giants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of 
devotion to-or rebellion against-that god. 
Wave harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and 
purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave fears 
that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god's 
demise. This destiny is something Wave might not be 
able to avert. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE WHELM 
Weapon (warhammer), legendary (requires attunemenc 
by a dwarf) 
Whelm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves 
and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain. 
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after 
you first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop 
a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you 
remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have 
disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability 
checks while you can see the daytime sky. 
Thrown Weapon. Whelm has the thrown property, 
with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 
feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using 
it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or 
an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a gian­
Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your 
hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the 
weapon lands at your feet. 
Shock Wave. You can use an action to strike the 
ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from 
the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the 
ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the 
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a 
success. Once used, this property can't be used again 
until the next dawn. 
Supernatural Awareness. While you are holding 
the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or 
concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you 
can use an action to cast detect evil and good or locate 
object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you 
can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn. 
Sentience. Whelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon 
with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a 
Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 120 feet. 
The weapon communicates telepathically with its 
wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. 
Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish 
when used in combat. 
Personality. Whelm's purpose is to slaughter giants 
and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against 
all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy 
goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. 
Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, 
variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. 
It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything 
to protect those dwarves from harm. 
The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries 
ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for 
a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His 
will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil 
purposes, even killing members of his own clan. 
ARTIFACTS 
An artifact is a unique magic item of tremendous power, 
with its own origin and history. An artifact might have 
been created by gods or mortals of awesome power. 
It could have been created in the midst of a crisis that 
threatened a kingdom, a world, or the entire multiverse, 
and carry the weight of that pivotal moment in history. 
Some artifacts appear when they are needed most. 
For others, the reverse is true; when discovered, the 
world trembles at the ramifications of the find. In either 
case, introducing an artifact into a campaign requires 
forethought. The artifact could be an item that opposing 
sides are hoping to claim, or it might be something the 
adventurers need to overcome their greatest challenge. 
Characters don't typically find artifacts in the 
normal course of adventuring. In fact, artifacts only 
appear when you want them to, for they are as much 
plot devices as magic items. Tracking down and 
recovering an artifact is often the main goal of an 
adventure. Characters must chase down rumors,

other magic items do, and the properties are often 
exceptionally powerful. An artifact might have other

this quest as if affected by the geas spell. Once you 
complete the quest, you are no longer affected by 
this property. 
16-20 The artifact houses a bodiless life force that is 
hostile toward you. Each time you use an action 
to use one of the artifact's properties , there is a 
50 percent chance that the life force tries to leave 
the artifact and enter your body. If you fail a DC

Monster Manual). Once it obtains the artifact, the 
avatar vanishes . 
DESTROYING ARTIFACTS 
An artifact must be destroyed in some special way. 
Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. 
Each artifact has a weakness by which its creation 
can be undone. Learning this weakness might require 
extensive research or the successful completion of a 
quest. The DM decides how a particular artifact can be 
destroyed. Some suggestions are provided here: 
The artifact must be melted down in the volcano, 
forge, or crucible in which it was created. 
The artifact must be dropped into the River Styx. 
The artifact must be swallowed and digested by the 
tarrasque or some other ancient creature. 
The artifact must be bathed in the blood of a god 
or an angel. 
The artifact must be struck and shattered by a special 
weapon crafted for that purpose. 
The artifact must be pulverized between the titanic 
gears of Mechanus. 
The artifact must be returned to its creator, who can 
destroy it by touch. 
SAMPLE ARTIFACTS 
The artifacts presented here have appeared in one or 
more of D&D worlds. Use them as guides when creating 
your own artifacts, or modify them as you see fit. 
AxE OF THE DWARVISH LORDS 
Weapon (battleaxe), artifact (requires attunement) 
eeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince 
came to believe that his people needed something to 
unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that 
would be such a symbol. 
Venturing deep under the mountains , deeper than 
any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of 
:\1oradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted 
four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, 
the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With 
them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords. 
Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the 
dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges 
and answered slights. The clans became allies, and 
they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era 
of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as 
the First King. When he became old, he passed the 
weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his 
heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many 
generations. 
Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and 
wickedness , the axe was lost in a bloody civil war 
fomented by greed for its power and the status it 
bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for 
the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of 
chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it. 
Magic Weapon. The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is 
a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and 
damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a 
belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of 
sharpness. 
Random Properties. The axe has the following 
randomly determined properties: 
2 minor beneficial properties 
1 major beneficial property 
• 2 minor detrimental properties 
Axe oF THE 
DwARviSH LoRDS 
~~~ Blessings of Moradin. If you are a dwarf attuned to 
the axe, you gain the following benefits: 
You have immunity to poison damage. 
The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet. 
• You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to 
blacksmithing , brewing, and stonemasonry. 
Conjure Earth Elemental. If you are holding the axe, 
you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental 
spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't 
use this property again until the next dawn. 
Travel the Depths. You can use an action to touch the 
axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the 
teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination 
is underground , there is no chance of a mishap or 
arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this 
property again until 3 days have passed. 
Curse. The axe bears a curse that affects any non­
dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement 
ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the 
creature's physical appearance and stature become 
more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like 
a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial 
traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical 
changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical 
in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled) , but they can 
be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a 
greater restoration or remove curse spell. 
Destroying the Axe. The only way to destroy the 
axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where 
it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for 
fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and 
is consumed. 
BOOK OF EXALTED DEEDS 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a 
creature of good alignment) 
The definitive treatise on all that is good in the 
multiverse , the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures 
prominently in many religions . Rather than being a 
scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various 
authors filled the pages with their own vision of true 
virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil. 
The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. 
As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other 
corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can 
bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts 
have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail 
to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it 
offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose. 
A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, . 
keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of 
good alignment that is attuned to the book can release

the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and

River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its 
pages and renders the book powerless for ld100 years 
BOOK OF VILE DARKNESS 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable 
wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's 
thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it 
contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the 
scrawled pages invites madness. 
Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book 
Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseas 
idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of 
blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna 
covered every vile topic he could, making the book a 
gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs. 
Other practitioners of evil have held the book and 
added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledg e. 
Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works 
stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or.·­
some cases, made notations and additions to existing 
text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. 
or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches 
that the original text can't be divined. 
Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary 
plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to 
approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever 
it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if th~ 
book rests on it long enough. 
VILE LORE 
The Book ofVile Darkness touches on every evil in the 
cosmos. A character can use the lore the book contains 
to unearth terrible secrets no mortal should know. Among 
the contents a character might find are the following , plus 
whatever else you choose: 
Vile Apotheosis . The book could hold a ritual that allows a 
character to become a lich or death knight. 
True Names. The true names of any number of fiends 
might be in the book. 
Dark Magic. Several spells of horrific evil of the OM's 
design and choosing could be in the book. Spells could 
impose dreadful curses, disfigure others, require human 
sacrifice, afflict creatures with crippling pain, spread vile 
plagues, and so on. 
A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours 
reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its 
benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's 
contents, provided that those modifications advance evil 
and expand the lore already contained within. 
Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book 
of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's 
alignment changes to neutral evil. 
The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only 
as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you 
fail to perform at least one evil act within the span 
of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the 
book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, 
an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be 
restored to life by any means while your soul remains 
imprisoned. 
Random Properties. The Book of Vile Darkness has 
the following random properties: 
3 minor beneficial properties 
• 1 major beneficial property 
3 minor detrimental properties 
2 major detrimenta l properties 
Adjusted Ability Scores. After you spend the 
requisite amount of time reading and studying the 
book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to 
a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice 
decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't 
adjust your ability scores again. 
Mark of Darkness. After you spend the requisite 
amount of time reading and studying the book, you 
acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign 
of your devotion to vile darkness . An evil rune might 
appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy 
black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or 
you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial 
features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature 
the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you 
advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to 
interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) 
checks made to interact with non-evil creatures. 
Command Evil. While you are attuned to the book 
and holding it, you can use an action to cast the 
dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). 
You can't use this property again until the next dawn. .

Dark Speech. While you carry the Book of Vile 
Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action 
to recite word from its pages in a foul language known 
as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12

feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage. 
Destroying the Book. The Book of Vile Darkness 
allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore 
contained on those pages finds its way back into the 
book eventually , usually when a new author adds pages 
to the tome. 
If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed 
for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark 
corner of the multiverse. 
A creature attuned to the book for one hundred 
years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text 
that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, 
destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding 
flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the 
multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 x 100 years later. 
If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns 
to dust and is forever destroyed. 
EYE AND HAND OF VECNA 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed 
voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all 
wizards. Through dark magic and conquest , he forged a 
terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape 
his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps 
to prevent his end from ever coming about. 
Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a 
ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond 
death, he became the greatest of allliches. Even 
though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna 
continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable 
and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to 
speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master 
of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of 
the Rotted Tower. 
Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the 
Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord 
made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the 
reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end 
in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. 
Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, 
grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered 
One's will in the world. 
The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might 
be found together or separately. The eye looks like a 
bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a 
mummified and shriveled left extremity. 
To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye 
and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye 
grafts itself to your head and remains there until you 
die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye 
with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is 
ever removed, you die. 
To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left 
hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against 
the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and 
becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever 
removed, you die. 
Random Properties. The Eye of Vecna and the Hand 
ofVecna each have the following random properties: 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE . • 1 minor beneficial property 
1 major beneficial property

Properties of the Eye. Your alignment changes tG 
neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits: 
You have truesight. 
You can use an action to see as if you were wearir:_, 
a ring of X-ray vision. You can end this effect as a 
bonus action. 
The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and 
expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the folio 
spells (save DC 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charg : 
crown of madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 cha =­

The eye regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges dail a­

is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul 
your body, devours it, and then takes control of the 
body like a puppet. If that happens , you become ar 
NPC under the DM's control. 
Properties of the Hand. Your alignment changes· 
neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits: 
Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is air -
20 or higher. 
Any melee spell attack you make with the hand. 
any melee weapon attack made with a weapon he 
it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.

daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the 
hand, it casts the suggestion spell on you (save DC 
18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The

Properties of the Eye and Hand. If you are at tun 
to both the hand and eye, you gain the following 
additional benefits: 
• You are immune to disease and poison. 
Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to s :::­
exhaustion. 
• You experience premonitions of danger and, unle-~ 
you are incapacitated, can't be surprised. 
• If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you 
regain 1dl0 hit points. 
If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to tur. 
bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. Y _ 
can do so by using an action to make a melee attac 
against a creature you can reach, using your choice 
your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On­
hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitu ti 
saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. 
• You can use an action to cast wish. This property c 
be used again until 30 days have passed. 
Destroying the Eye and Hand. If the Eye of Vecna 
and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same 
creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of 
Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn 
to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to 
destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact 
reappears in one ofVecna's many hidden vaults, where 
ir waits to be rediscovered . 
ORB OF DRAGONKIND 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans 
waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the 
world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of 
High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest 
magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) 
w help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken 
o each of the five towers, and there they were used to 
-peed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards 
u ed the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed 
the dragons with powerful magic. 
As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the 
orbs were destroyed or faded into legend , and only three 
are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped 
and twisted over the centuries, so although their 
primary purpose of calling dragons still functions , they 
also allow some measure of control over dragons. 
Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a 
presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from 
·.Those lacking in force of personality might find 
· emselves enslaved to an orb. 
An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in 
diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in 
·ameter, and mist swirls inside it. 
While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to 
xer into the orb's depths and speak its command 
:ord. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. 
n a successf ul check, you control the orb for as long 
-you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you 
xcome charmed by the orb for as long as you remain 
..:. uned to it. ORB OF DRAGONKINO 
EvE AND 11AND 
OF VECNA 
While you are charmed by the orb, you can't 
voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts 
suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you 
to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon 
essence within the orb might want many things: the 
annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the 
orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the 
worship ofTakhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or 
something else the DM decides. 
Random Properties. An Orb of Dragon kind has the 
following random properties: 
• 2 minor beneficial properties 
• 1 minor detrimental property 
1 major detrimental property 
Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 
expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, 
you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges 
to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: 
cure wounds (5th-leve l version, 3 charges), daylight (1 
charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges). 
You can also use an action to cast the detect magic 
spell from the orb without using any charges. 
Call Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use 
an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call 
that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons 
in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as 
possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such 
as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to 
the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them 
against their will. Once you have used this property, it 
can't be used again for 1 hour. 
Destroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears 
fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the 
attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate 
spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is 
sufficient to destroy an orb, however . 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
SwoRD OF KAs 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 
When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and 
ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as 
his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain 
served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes 
earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword 
with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it. 
For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but 
as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sw;rd 
urged him to supplant Vecna,.so that they could rule 
the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's 
destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought 
his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's 
sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby. 
The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that 
grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with 
it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals 
an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead. 
If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of 
being drawn from its scabbard , its wielder must make a 
DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the 
wielder take 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the 
wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate 
monster spell, and the sword demands that it be 
bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's 
demand is met. 
Random Properties. The Sword of Kas has the 
following random properties: 
1 minor beneficial property 
• 1 major beneficial property 
1 minor detrimental property 
• 1 major detrimental property 
Wt>.ND OF 0RCUS 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE Spirit ofKas. While the sword is on your person, you 
add a dlO to your initiative at the start of every combat. 
In addition, when you use an action to attack with the 
sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus r 
your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remai­
in effect until the start of your next turn. 
Spells. While the sword is on your person, you can 
use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 
18) from it: call lightning, divine word, or finger of dead: 
Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast 
that spell again from it until the next dawn. 
Sentience. The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic e\ 
weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and 
a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to 2 
range of 120 feet. 
The weapon communicates telepathically with its 
wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common 
Personality. The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to 
Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the licb·s 
works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill 
this goal. 
The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone 
corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword's 
obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a 
fixation for its wielder. 
Destroying the Sword. A creature attuned to both 
the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the 
wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake 
the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spe 
and make a Charisma check contested by the Charis . 
check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feer 
of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the 
contest, nothing happens, and the wish spell is wasteC. 
If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed.

WAND OF 0RCUS 
Wand, artifact (requires attunement) 
The ghastly Wand of Orcus rarely leaves Orcus's side. 
The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon 
lord's aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and 
bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. Orcus 
allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. 
When it does, it magically appears wherever its master 
senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal. 
Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped 
with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to 
a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically 
change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. 
Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive 
in the wand's presence. 
Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the 
wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. 
On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic 
damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises 
as a zombie. 
In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can 
be wielded as a magic mace that grants a + 3 bonus to 
attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals 
an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit. 
Random Properties. The Wand of Orcus has the 
following random properties: 
• 2 minor beneficial properties 
1 major beneficial property 
2 minor detrimental properties 
1 major detrimental property 
The detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are 
suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus himself. 
Protection. You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while 
holding the wand. 
Spells. The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you 
can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges 
to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from 
it: animate dead (1 charge), blight (2 charges), circle of 
death (3 charges), finger of death (3 charges), power 
word kill (4 charges), or speak with dead (1 charge). The 
wand regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. 
While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower 
blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 
2 fewer charges (minimum of 0). 
Call Undead. While you are holding the wand, you 
can use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, 
calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit 
points among, each undead having average hit points 
(see the Monster Manual for statistics). The undead 
magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in 
unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your 
commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of 
the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of 
bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property 
of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn. 
While attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any 
kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The 
undead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following 
day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them. 
Sentience. The Wand ofOrcus is a sentient, chaotic 
evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a 
range of 120 feet. 
The wand communicates telepathically with its 
wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal 
and Common . 
Personality. The wand's purpose is to help satisfy 
Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The 
wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic , and bereft of humor. 
In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns 
devotion to its current user and makes grandiose 
promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as 
vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus. 
Destroying the Wand. Destroying the Wand of Orcus 
requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by 
the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to 
happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life­
no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned 
the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded. 
Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack 
and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the 
wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss. 
OTHER REWARDS 
As much as adventurers desire treasure, they often 
appreciate other forms of reward. This section 
presents a variety of ways that gods, monarchs , and 
other beings of power might recognize the characters ' 
accomplishments, including supernatural gifts that 
give characters new capabilities; titles, lands, and other 
marks of prestige; and boons that are available only to 
adventurers who have reached 20th level. 
SUPERNATURAL GIFTS 
A supernatural gift is a special reward granted 
by a being or force of great magical power. Such 
supernatural gifts come in two forms: blessings and 
charms. A blessing is usually bestowed by a god or 
a godlike being. A charm is typically the work of a 
powerful spirit, a location of ancient magic, or a creature 
that has legendary actions. Unlike a magic item, a 
supernatural gift isn't an object and doesn't require 
attunement. It gives a character an extraordinary ability, 
which can be used one or more times. 
BLESSINGS 
A character might receive a blessing from a deity for 
doing something truly momentous-an accomplishment 
that catches the attention of both gods and mortals. 
Killing rampaging gnolls rarely warrants such a 
blessing, but slaying the high priest of Tiamat as he 
attempts to summon the Dragon Queen might. 
A blessing is an appropriate reward for one of the 
following accomplishments: 
• Restoring the most sacred shrine of a god 
• Foiling an earthshaking plot by the enemies of a god 
• Helping a god's favored servant complete a holy quest 
An adventur er might also receive a blessing in 
advance of a perilous quest. For example, a paladin 
could receive one before setting out on a quest to slay a 
terrifying lich that is responsible for a magical plague 
sweeping the land. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 227 
A character should receive only a blessing that is 
useful to him or her, and some blessings come with 
expectations on the part of the benefactor. A god 
typically gives a blessing for a particular purpose, such 
as recovering a holy person's remains or toppling a 
tyrannical empire. The god might revoke a blessing 
if a character fails to pursue that purpose or acts 
counter to it. 
A character retains the benefits of a blessing forever or 
until it is taken away by the god who granted it. Unlike 
a magic item, such a blessing can't be suppressed by an 
anti magic field or similar effect. 
Most adventurers go their entire lives without 
receiving even one of these blessings. There is no limit 
on the number of blessings a character can receive, 
but it should be rare for a character to have more than 
one at a time. Moreover, a character can't benefit from 
multiple instances of a blessing at the same time. For/ 
example, a character can't benefit from two instances ,,s>f 
the Blessing of Health at once. 
Example blessings are provided below. The text of a 
blessing addresses its user. If you decide to create more 
blessings, consider this: a typical blessing mimics the 
properties of a wondrous item. 
Blessing of Health. Your Constitution score increases 
by 2, up to a maximum of 22. 
Blessing of Protection. You gain a +1 bonus to AC 
and saving throws. 
Blessing of Magic Resistance. You have advantage on 
saving throws against spells and other magical effects. 
Blessing of Understanding. Your Wisdom score 
increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22. 
Blessing ofValhaJJa. This blessing grants you the 
power to summon spirit warriors , as if you had blown a 
silver horn of Valhalla. Once you use this blessing, you 
can't use it again until 7 days have passed. 
Blessing of Weapon Enhancement. One nonmagical 
weapon in your possession becomes a +1 weapon 
whenever you wield it. 
Blessing of Wound Closure. This blessing grants you 
the benefits of a periapt of wound closure. 
CHARMS 
A charm is a minor supernatural gift, which can 
be received in a large variety of ways. For example, 
a wizard who finds an eldritch secret in a dead 
arch mage's spellbook might be infused with the magic 
of a charm, as might a character who solves a sphinx's 
riddle or drinks from a magic fountain. Legendary 
creatures, such as ancient gold dragons and unicorns, 
sometimes grace their allies with charms, and some 
explorers find themselves bearing the magic of a charm 
after discovering a long-lost location that is drenched in 
primeval magic. 
Some charms can be used only once, and others can 
be used a specific number of times before vanishing. If a 
charm lets you cast a spell, you are able to do so without 
spending a spell slot or providing any components 
(verbal, somatic, or material). In any case, a charm can't 
be used in the area created by an antimagic field or a 
similar effect, and a charm's effects are susceptible to 
dispel magic and the like. But the charm itself can't be 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE removed from a creature by anything short of divine 
intervention or the wish spell. 
Example charms are provided below. The text of a 
charm addresses its user. A typical charm mimics the 
effects of a potion or a spell, so it is easy to create more 
charms of your own, if you like. 
Charm of Animal Conjuring. This charm allows 
you to cast the conjure animals spell (3rd-level version

Charm of Feather FaJJing. This charm grants you -­
benefits of a ring of feather falling. These benefits last 
for 10 days, after which the charm vanishes from you. 
Charm of Heroism. This charm allows you to give 
yourself the benefit of a potion of heroism as an action. 
Once you do so, the charm vanishes from you. 
Charm of Restoration. This charm has 6 charges. 
You can use an action to expend some of its charges 
to cast one of the following spells: greater restoration 
(4 charges) or Jesser restoration (2 charges). Once 
all its charges have been expended, the charm 
vanishes from you. 
Charm of the Slayer. One sword in your possession 
becomes a dragon slayer or giant slayer (DM's choice) 
for the next 9 days. The charm then vanishes from you 
and the weapon returns to normal. 
Charm of Vitality. This charm allows you to give 
yourself the benefit of a potion of vitality as an action. 
Once you do so, the charm vanishes from you. 
MARKS OF PRESTIGE 
Sometimes the most memorable reward for adventur e~ 
is the prestige that they acquire throughout a realm. 
Their adventures often earn them fame and power, 
allies and enemies, and titles that they can pass on to 
their descendants. Some lords and ladies began as 
commoners who ventured into the dangerous places oi 
the world and made names for themselves through the -
brave deeds. 
This section details the most common marks of 
prestige that adventures might acquire during a 
campaign. These marks are usually gained along with 
treasure, but sometimes they stand on their own. 
LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION 
When gold is in short supply, the adventurers' 
benefactor might provide them with a letter of 
recommendation instead of monetary payment. Such a 
letter is usually enclosed in a handsome folio, case, or 
scroll tube for safe transport, and it usually bears the 
signature and seal of whoever wrote it. 
A letter of recommendation from a person of 
impeccable reputation can grant adventurers access 
to NPCs that they would otherwise have trouble 
meeting on their own, such as a duke, viceroy, or queen. 
Moreover, carrying such a recommendation on one's 
person can help clear up "misunderstandings" with 
local authorities who might not otherwise take the 
adventurers at their word. 
A letter of recommendation is worth only as much as 
the person who wrote it and offer no benefit in places 
where its writer holds no sway. 
MEDALS 
Although they are often fashioned from gold and 
other precious materials , medals have an even greater 
symbolic value to those who award and receive them. 
Medals are typically awarded by powerful political 
figures for acts of heroism, and wearing a medal 
is usually enough to earn the respect of those who 
understand its significan ce. 
Different acts of heroism can warrant different 
kinds of medals. The King of Breland (in the Eberron 
campaign setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor 
(shaped like a shield and made of ruby and electrum) 
to adventurers for defending Brei ish citizens, while 
the Golden Bear of Breland (a medal made of gold and 
shaped in a likeness of a bear's head, with gems for 
eyes) might be reserved for adventurers who prove their 
allegiance to the Brelish Crown by uncovering and 
defeating a plot to end the Treaty of Thronehold and 
reignite the Last War. 
A medal doesn't offer a specific in-game benefit to one 
who wears it, but it can affect dealings with NPCs. For 
example, a character who proudly displays the Golden 
Bear of Breland will be regarded as a hero of the people 
within the kingdom of Breland. Outside Breland, the 
medal carries far less weight, except among allies of 
Breland's king. 
PARCELS OF LAND 
A parcel of land is just that, and usually comes with a 
royal letter affirming that the land has been granted as a 
reward for some service. Such land usually remains the 
property of the local ruler or ruling body, but is leased 
to a character with the understanding that it can be 
taken away, especially if his or her loyalty is ever called 
into question. 
A parcel of land, if sufficiently large, might have one or 
more farms or villages on it already, in which case the 
recipient is pronounced lord or lady of the land and is 
expected to collect taxes, along with any other duties. 
A character who receives a parcel of land is free to 
build on it and is expected to safeguard it. He or she may 
yield the land as part of an inheritance , but can't sell 
or trade it without permission from the local ruler or 
ruling body. 
Parcels of land make fine rewards for adventurers 
who are looking for a place to settle or who have family 
or some kind of personal investment in the region where 
the land is located. 
SPECIAL FAVORS 
A reward might come in the form of a favor that the 
characters can call on at some future date. Special 
favors work best when the individual granting them is 
trustworthy. A lawful good or lawful neutral NPC will 
do whatever can be done to fulfill an obligation when 
the time comes, short of breaking laws. A lawful evil 
NPC does the same, but only because a deal is a deal. 
A neutral good or neutral PC might pay off favors to 
protect his or her reputation. A chaotic good NPC is 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE 
230 more·concerned about doing right by the adventurers, 
honoring any obligations without worrying too much 
about personal risk or adherence to the law. 
SPECIAL RIGHTS 
A politically powerful person can reward characters by 
giving them special rights, which are usually articulated 
in some sort of official document. For example, 
characters might be granted special rights to carry 
weapons in public places, kill enemies of the crown, or 
negotiate on a duke's behalf. They might earn the right 
to demand free room and board from any establishment 
within a particular community, or have the right to draft 
local militia to assist them as needed. 
Special rights last only as long as the legal document 
dictates, and such rights can be revoked if the 
adventurers abuse them. 
STRONGHOLDS 
A stronghold is a reward usually given to seasoned 
adventurers who demonstrate unwavering fealty to a" 
powerful political figure or ruling body, such as a king, 
a knighthood, or a council of wizards. A stronghold 
can be anything from a fortified tower in the heart of 
a city to a provincial keep on the borderlands. While 
the stronghold is for the characters to govern as they 
see fit, the land on which it sits remains the property of 
the crown or local ruler. Should the characters prove 
disloyal or unworthy of the gift, they can be asked or 
forced to relinquish custody of the stronghold. 
CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE As an additional reward, the individual bequeathin g 
the stronghold might offer to pay its maintenance cost 
for a period of one or more months, after which the 
characters inherit that responsibility. See chapter 6 for 
more information on stronghold maintenance. 
TITLES 
A politically powerful figure has the ability to dispense 
titles. A title often comes with a parcel of land (see 
above). For example, a character might be awarded the 
title Earl of Storm river or Countess of Dun Fjord, along 
with a parcel of land that includes a settlement or region 
of the same name. 
A character can hold more than one title, and in a 
feudal society, those titles can be passed down to (or 
distributed among) one's children. While a character 
holds a title, he or she is expected to act in a manner 
befitting that title. By decree, titles can be stripped away 
if the local ruler or ruling body has reason to question 
the character's loyalty or competence. 
ALTERNATIVES TO EPIC BOONS 
You might decide to grant one of the following rewards to a 
20th-level character, instead of awarding an epic boon. These 
two options can be awarded to a character more than once. 
Ability Score Improvement. The character can increase one 
ability score by 2 or increase two ability scores by l each. 
The ability score can now be increased above 20, up to a 
maximum of 30. 
New Feat. The character gains a new feat chosen by the 
player, but subject to your approval. ,. 
TRAINING 
A character might be offered pecial training in lieu of 
a financial reward. This kind of training isn't widely 
available and thus is highly desirable. It presumes 
the existence of a skilled trainer-perhaps a retired 
adventurer or champion who is willing to serve as a 
mentor. The trainer might be a reclusive wizard or 
haughty sorcerer who owes the queen a favor, the 
knight-commander of the King's Guard, the leader of 
a powerful druid circle, a quirky monk who lives in a 
remote mountaintop pagoda, a barbaria n chieftain, a 
warlock living among nomads as a fortune-teller, or an 
absentminded bard whose plays and poetry are known 
throughout the land. 
A character who agrees to training as a reward must 
spend downtim e with the trainer (see chapter 6 for 
more information on downtim e activities). In exchange, 
the character is guaranteed to receive a special benefit. 
Possible training benefits include the following: 
The character gains inspiration daily at dawn for 
ld4 + 6 days. 
• The character gains proficiency in a skill. 
The character gains a feat. 
EPIC BOONS 
An epic boon is a special power available only to 20th 
level characters. Characters at that level gain such 
boons only if you want them to and only when you feel 
it's appropriate. Epic boons are best awarded after 
the characters complete a major quest, or accomplish 
something else particularly notable. A character might 
gain an epic boon after destroying an evil artifact, 
defeating an ancient dragon, or halting an incursion 
from the Outer Planes. 
Epic boons can also be used as a form of 
advancement, a way to provide greater power to 
characters who have no more levels to gain. With this 
approach , consider awarding one epic boon to each 
character for every 30,000 XP he or she earns above 
355,000 XP. 
You determine which epic boon a character gains. 
Ideally, the boon you pick is something the character 
would put to use in future adventures. You can allow a 
player to select a boon for his or her character, subject to 
your approval. 
Whatever boon a character ends up with, consider its 
place in your story and world. Many of the boons are 
extraordinary and represent the gradual transformation 
of a character into something resembling a demigod. 
The acquisition of a boon might visibly transform a 
character. For example, the eyes of a character with 
the Boon of True sight might glow when he or she feels 
strong emotion, and a character who has the Boon of 
High Magic might have faint motes of light glimmering 
around his or her head. Also, decide how the boon first 
appears. Does the boon appear spontaneously and 
mysteriously? Or does a being of cosmic power manifest 
to bestow it? The bestowal of a boon can itself be an 
exciting scene in an adventure. 
The text of a boon addresses its user. Unless a boon 
says otherwise , a character can't gain it more than once. •

CHAPTER 8: RUNNING THE GAME 
ULES ENABLE YOU AND YOUR PLAYERS TO HAVE 
fun at the table. The rules serve you, not vice 
versa. There are the rules of the game, and 
there are table rules for how the game is 
played. For instance, players need to know 
what happens when one of them misses a 
session. They need to know whether to bring 
miniatures , any special rules you've decided to use, and 
how to treat a cocked die (a die that lands so that its 
face can't be clearly read). These topics and more are 
covered in this chapter. 
TABLE RULES 
Ideally, players come to the gaming table with the same 
goal: to have a fun time together. This section gives 
recommendations for table rules you can establish to 
help meet that goal. Here are some fundamentals: 
Foster respect. Don't bring personal conflicts to the 
table or let disagreements escalate into bad feelings. 
Don't touch others' dice if they're sensitive about it. 
Avoid distractions. Turn off the television and video 
games. If you have young children, hire a babysitter. 
Reducing distractions helps players stay in character 
and enjoy the story. It might be fine to have players 
wandering away from the table and back, but some 
players prefer planned breaks. 
Have snacks. Decide before a session who will bring 
food and drink. This is often something the players 
can handle. 
TABLE TALK 
Set expectations about how players talk at the table: 
Make it clear who's speaking: the character or the 
player (out of character). 
Decide how you feel about a player sharing 
information that his or her character wouldn't know or 
that the character is incapable of sharing as a result of 
being unconscious , dead, or far away. 
Are you all right with players retracting what they just 
said their characters did? 
DICE ROLLING 
Establish expectations about rolling dice. Rolling in full 
view of everyone is a good starting point. If you see a 
player rolling and scooping the dice up before anyone 
else can see, encourage that player to be less secretive. 
When a die falls on the floor, do you count it or reroll 
it? When it lands cocked against a book, do you pull the 
book away and see where it lands, or re~;oll it? 
What about you, the DM? Do you make your rolls in 
the open or hide them behind a DM screen? Consider 
the following: 
If you roll dice where the players can see, they know 
you're playing impartially and not fudging rolls. 
Rolling behind a screen keeps the players guessing 
about the strength of their opposition. When a monster hits all the time, is it of a much higher level 
than the characters , or are you rolling high numbers? 
Rolling behind a screen lets you fudge the results if 
you want to. If two critical hits in a row would kill a 
character , you could change the second critical hit 
into a normal hit, or even a miss. Don't distort die rolls 
too often, though, and don't let on that you're doing it. 
Otherwise , your players might think they don't face 
any real risks-or worse, that you're playing favorites. 
A roll behind a screen can help preserve mystery. For 
example, if a player thinks there might be someone 
invisible nearby and makes a Wisdom (Perception) 
check, consider rolling a die behind the screen even if 
no one is there, making the player think someone is, 
indeed, hiding . Try not to overuse this trick. 
You might choose to make a roll for a player because 
you don't want the player to know how good the check 
total is. For example, if a player suspects a baroness 
might be charmed and wants to make a Wisdom 
(Insight) check, you could make the roll in secret for 
the player. If the player rolled and got a high number 
but didn't sense anything amiss, the player would be 
confident that the baroness wasn't charmed. With a 
low roll, a negative answer wouldn't mean much. A 
hidden roll allows uncertainty. 
ROLLING ATTACKS AND DAMAGE 
Players are accustomed to rolling an attack roll first 
and then a damage roll. If players make attack rolls and 
damage rolls at the same time, the action moves a little 
faster around the table. 
RULES DISCUSSIONS 
You might need to set a policy on rules discussions at 
the table. Some groups don't mind putting the game 
on hold while they hash out different interpretations 
of a rule. Others prefer to let the DM make a call and 
continue with the action. If you gloss over a rules issue 
in play, make a note of it (a good task to delegate to a 
player) and return to the issue later. 
METAGAME THINKING 
Metagame thinking means thinking about the game as 
a game. It's like when a character in a movie knows it's a 
movie and acts accordingly . For example, a player might 
say, "The DM wouldn't throw such a powerful monster 
at us!" or you might hear, "The read-aloud text spent a 
lot of time describing that door-let's search it again!" 
Discourage metagame thinking by giving players a 
gentle reminder: "What do your characters think?" You 
can curb metagame thinking by setting up situations 
that will be difficult for the characters and that might 
require negotiation or retreat to survive. 
MISSING PLAYERS 
How should you deal with the characters of missing 
players? Consider these options: 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNN lNG THE GAME 
Have another player run the missing player's 
character. The player running the extra character 
should strive to keep the character alive and use 
resources wisely. 
• Run the character yourself. It's an extra burden for 
you, but it can work. 
• Decide the character isn't there. Invent a good reason 
for the character to miss the adventure, perhaps 
by having him or her linger in town or continue a 
downtime activity. Leave a way for the character to 
rejoin the party when the player returns. 
Have the character fade into the background. This 
solution requires everyone to step out of the game 
world a bit and suspend disbelief, but might be the 
easiest solution. You act as if the character 's not there, 
but don't try to come up with any in-game explanation 
for this absence. Monsters don't attack the character , 
who returns the favor. On returning , the player 
resumes playing as if he or she was never gone. 
SMALL GROUPS 
Most of the time, each player runs one character. 
The game plays best that way, without overwhelming 
anyone. But if your group is small, players can control 
more than one character . Or you can fill out the group 
with NPC followers, using the guidelines in chapter 4, 
"Creating Nonplayer Characters. " You can also make 
the characters more resilient by using the healing surge 
option in chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop. " 
Don't force a reluctant player to take on multiple 
characters, and don't show favoritism by allowing only 
one player to do so. If one character is the mentor of 
the other, the player can focus on roleplaying just one 
character . Otherwise , players can end up awkwardly 
talking to themselves in character, or avoiding 
roleplaying altogether. 
Multiple characters can be a good idea in a game 
that features nonstop peril and a high rate of character 
death. If your group agrees to the premise, have each 
player keep one or two additional characters on hand, 
ready to jump in whenever the current character dies. 
Each time the main character gains a level, the backup 
characters do as well. 
NEW PLAYERS ------
When a new player joins the group, allow the new 
player to create a character of a level equal to the 
lowest-level member of the party. The only exception 
to this guideline is when the new player is completely 
unfamiliar with the D&D game. In that case, have that 
player start with a 1st-level character. If the rest of tlie 
party is significantly higher in level, consider taking a 
short break from the campaign and having everyone 
play a 1st-level character for a few sessions while the 
new player learns the ropes. 
Integrating a new character into the group can be 
difficult if the party is in the middle of an adventure. The 
following approaches can help make it easier: 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE. GAME The new character is a friend or relative of one of the 
adventurers who has been searching for the group. 
• The new character is a prisoner of the foes the other 
characters are fighting. When rescued, this character 
joins their group. 
The new character is the sole survivor of another 
adventuring group. 
THE ROLE OF DICE 
Dice are neutral arbiters. They can determine the 
outcome of an action without assigning any motivatio n 
to the DM and without playing favorites . The extent to 
which you use them is entirely up to you. 
ROLLING WITH IT 
Some DMs rely on die rolls for almost everything. Whe 
a character attempts a task, the DM calls for a check a 
picks a DC. As a DM using this style, you can't rely on 
the characters succeeding or failing on any one check 
to move the action in a specific direction. You must be 
ready to improvise and react to a changing situation. 
Relying on dice also gives the players the sense that 
anything is possible. Sure, it might seem unlikely that 
the party's hal fling can leap on the ogre's back, pull a 
sack over its head, and then dive to safety, but with a 
lucky enough roll it just might work. 
A drawback of this approach is that roleplaying 
can diminish if players feel that their die rolls, rather 
than their decisions and characterizations , always 
determine success. 
IGNORING THE DICE 
One approach is to use dice as rarely as possible. Some 
DMs use them only during combat, and determine 
success or failure as they like in other situations. 
With this approach , the DM decides whether an action 
or a plan succeeds or fails based on how well the player: 
make their case, how thorough or creative they are, or 
other factors. For example, the players might describe 
how they search for a secret door, detailing how they 
tap on a wall or twist a torch sconce to find its trigger. 
That could be enough to convince the DM that they 
find the secret door without having to make an ability 
check to do so. 
This approach rewards creativity by encouraging 
players to look to the situation you've described for an 
answer, rather than looking to their character sheet or 
their character's special abilities. A downside is that no 
DM is completely neutral. ADM might come to favor 
certain players or approaches , or even work against 
good ideas if they send the game in a direction he or she 
doesn't like. This approach can also slow the game if the 
DM focuses on one "correct" action that the characters 
must describe to overcome an obstacle. 
THE MIDDLE PATH 
Many DMs find that using a combination of the two 
approaches works best. By balancing the use of dice 
against deciding on success, you can encourage your 
players to strike a balance between relying on their 
bonuses and abilities and paying attention 
to the game and immersing themselves in 
its world. 
Remember that dice don't run your 
game-you do. Dice are like rules. They're 
tools to help keep the action moving. At any 
time, you can decide that a player's action is 
automatically successful. You can also grant 
the player advantage on any ability check, 
reducing the chance of a bad die roll foiling the 
character's plans. By the same token, a bad plan 
or unfortunate circumstances can transform the 
easiest task into an impossibility , or at least impose 
disadvantage. 
USING ABILITY SCORES 
When a player wants to do something , it's often 
appropriate to let the attempt succeed without a roll 
or a reference to the character 's ability scores. For 
example, a character doesn't normally need to make 
a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room or a 
Charisma check to order a mug of ale. Only call for a 
roll if there is a meaningful consequence for failure. 
When deciding whether to use a roll, ask yourself two 
questions: 
Is a task so easy and so free of conflict and stress that 
there should be no chance of failure? 
Is a task so inappropriate or impossible -such as 
hitting the moon with an arrow-that it can't work? 
If the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind 
of roll is appropriate. The following sections provide 
guidance on determining whether to call for an ability 
check, attack roll, or saving throw; how to assign DCs; 
when to use advantage and disadvantage; and other 
related topics. 
ABILITY CHECKS 
An ability check is a test to see whether a character 
succeeds at a task that he or she has decided to attempt. 
The Player's Handbook includes examples of what 
each ability score is used for. The Ability Checks table 
summarizes that material for easy reference. 
MULTIPLE ABILITY CHECKS 
Sometimes a character fails an ability check and 
wants to try again. In some cases, a character is free 
to do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With 
enough attempts and enough time, a character should 
~ABILITY CHECKS 
Ability Used for... Example Uses eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, 
assume that a character spending ten times the normal 
amount of time needed to complete a task automatically 
succeeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating 
the check allows a character to turn an impossible task 
into a successful one. 
In other cases, failing an ability check makes it 
impossible to make the same check to do the same thing 
again. For example, a rogue might try to trick a town 
guard into thinking the adventurers are undercover 
agents of the king. If the rogue loses a contest of 
Charisma (Deception) against the guard's Wisdom 
(Insight), the same lie told again won't work. The 
characters can come up with a different way to get past 
the guard or try the check again against another guard 
at a different gate. But you might decide that the initial 
failure makes those checks more difficult to pull off. 
Strength Physical force and athleticism Smash down a door, move a boulder, use a spike to wedge a door shut 
Dexterity Agility, reflexes, and balance Sneak past a guard, walk along a narrow ledge, wriggle free from chains 
Constitution Stamina and health Endure a marathon, grasp hot metal without flinching, win a drinking contest

CONTESTS 
A contest is a kind of ability check that matches 
two creatures against each other. Use a contest if a 
character attempts something that either directly foils 
or is directly opposed by another creature's efforts. In a 
contest, the ability checks are compared to each other, 
rather than to a target number. 
When you call for a contest, you pick the ability that 
each side must use, deciding whether both sides use the 
same ability or whether different abilities should counter 
each other. For example, when a creature tries to hide, it 
engages in a contest of Dexterity against Wisdom. But if 
two creatures arm wrestle, or if one creature is holding 
a door closed against another's attempt to push it open, 
both use Strength. SAVING THROWS

Strength Opposing a force that would physically move

Wisdom Resisting effects that charm, frighten, or 
otherwise assault your willpower 
Charisma Withstanding effects, such as possession ,

ATTACK ROLLS you to another plane of existence ----- ------------
Call for an attack roll when a character tries to hit a 
creature or an object with an attack, especially when 
the attack could be foiled by the target's armor or shield 
or by another object providing cover. You can also use 
attack rolls to resolve noncombat activities such as 
archery contests or a game of darts. 
SAVING THROWS 
A saving throw is an instant response to a harmful effect 
and is almost never done by choice. A save makes the 
most sense when something bad happens to a character 
and the character has a chance to avoid that effect. An 
ability check is something a character actively attempts 
to accomplish, whereas a saving throw is a split-second 
response to the activity of someone or something else. 
Most of the time, a saving throw comes into play when 
an effect-such as a spell, monster ability, or trap-calls 
for it, telling you what kind of saving throw is involved 
and providing a DC for it. 
Other times, a situation arises that clearly calls for a 
saving throw, especially when a character is subjected 
to a harmful effect that can't be hedged out by armor or 
a shield. It's up to you to decide which ability score is 
involved. The Saving Throws table offers suggestions. 
INTELLIGENCE CHECK VS. WISDOM CHECK 
If you have trouble deciding whether to call for an Intelli­
gence or a Wisdom check to determine whether a character 
notices something, think of it in terms of what a very high or 
low score in those two abilities might mean. 
A character with a high Wisdom but low Intelligence is 
aware of the surroundings but is bad at interpreting what 
things mean. The character might spot that one section of 
a wall is clean and dusty compared to the others, but he or 
she wouldn't necessarily make the deduction that a secret 
door is there. 
In contrast, a character with high Intelligence and low 
Wisdom is probably oblivious but clever. The character might 
not spot the clean section of wall but, if asked about it, could 
immediately deduce why it's clean. 
Wisdom checks allow characters to perceive what is 
around them (the wall is clean here), while Intelligence 
checks answer why things are that way (there's probably a 
secret door).

CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME DIFFICULTY CLASS 
It's your job to establish the Difficulty Class for an abili _ 
check or a saving throw when a rule or an adventur e 
doesn't give you one. Sometimes you'll even want to 
change such established DCs. When you do so, think o: 
how difficult a task is and then pick the associated DC 
from the Typical DCs table. 
TYPICAL DCs 
Task DC Task DC 
Very easy 5 Hard 20 
Easy 10 Very hard 25 
Moderate 15 Nearly impossible 30 
The numbers associated with these categories of 
difficulty are meant to be easy to keep in your head, 
so that you don't have to refer to this book every time 
you decide on a DC. Here are some tips for using DC 
categories at.the gaming table. 
If you've decided that an ability check is called for, 
then most likely the task at hand isn't a very easy 
one. Most people can accomplish a DC 5 task with 
little chance of failure. Unless circumstances are 
unusual, let characters succeed at such a task without 
making a check. 
Then ask yourself, "Is this task's difficulty easy, 
moderate, or hard?" If the only DCs you ever use are 1C 
15, and 20, your game will run just fine. Keep in mind 
that a character with a 10 in the associated ability and 
no proficiency will succeed at an easy task around 50 
percent of the time. A moderate task requires a higher 
score or proficiency for success, whereas a hard task 
typically requires both. A big dose of luck with the d20 
also doesn't hurt. 
If you find yourself thinking, "This task is especiall y 
hard," you can use a higher DC, but do so with caution 
and consider the level of the characters. A DC 25 task 
is very hard for low-level characters to accomplish, bu­
it becomes more reasonable after lOth level or so. A 
DC 30 check is nearly impossible for most low-level 
characters . A 20th-level character with proficiency and -
relevant ability score of 20 still needs a 19 or 20 on the 
die roll to succeed at a task of this difficulty . 
VARIANT: AUTOMATIC SUCCESS 
Sometimes the randomness of a d20 roll leads to 
ludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a successful 
DC 15 Strength check to be battered down. A fighter 
with a Strength of 20 might helplessly flail against the 
door because of bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with 
a Strength of 10 rolls a 20 and knocks the door from 
its hinges. 
If such results bother you, consider allowing 
automatic success on certain checks. Under this 
optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any 
ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant 
ability score minus 5. So in the example above, the 
fighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule 
doesn't apply to contests, saving throws, or attack rolls. 
Having proficiency with a skill or tool can also 
grant automatic success. If a character's proficiency 
bonus applies to his or her ability check, the character 
automatically succeeds if the DC is 10 or less. If that 
character is 11th level or higher, the check succeeds if 
the DC is 15 or less. 
The downside of this whole approach is its 
predictability. For example, once a character's ability 
score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that 
ability become automatic successes . Smart players 
will then always match the character with the highest 
ability score against any given check. If you want some 
risk of failure, you need to set higher DCs. Doing this, 
though, can aggravate the problem you're trying to solve: 
higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even 
more on luck. 
PROFICIENCY 
When you ask a player to make an ability check, 
consider whether a skill or tool proficiency might apply 
to it. The player might also ask you if a particular 
proficiency applies. 
One way to think about this question is to consider 
whether a character could become better at a particular 
task through training and practice. If the answer is 
no, it's fine to say that no proficiency applies. But if 
the answer is yes, assign an appropriate skill or tool 
proficiency to reflect that training and practice. 
SKILLS 
As described in the Player's Handbook, a skill 
proficiency represents a character's focus on one 
aspect of an ability. Among all the things a character's 
Dexterity score describes, the character might be 
particularly skilled at sneaking around, reflected in 
proficiency in the Stealth skill. When that skill is used 
for an ability check, it is usually used with Dexterity. 
Under certain circumstances, you can decide a 
character's proficiency in a skill can be applied to a 
different ability check. For example, you might decide 
that a character forced to swim from an island to the 
mainland must succeed on a Constitution check (as 
opposed to a Strength check) because of the distance 
involved. The character is proficient in the Athletics 
skill, which covers swimming , so you allow the 
character's proficiency bonus to apply to this ability check. In effect, you're asking for a Constitution 
(Athletics) check, instead of a Strength (Athletics) check. 
Often, players ask whether they can apply a skill 
proficiency to an ability check. If a player can provide 
a good justification for why a character's training and 
aptitude in a skill should apply to the check, go ahead 
and allow it, rewarding the player's creative thinking. 
TOOLS 
Having proficiency with a tool allows you to apply 
your proficiency bonus to an ability check you make 
using that tool. For example, a character proficient 
with carpenter's tools can apply his or her proficiency 
bon.us to a Dexterity check to craft a wooden flute, an 
Intelligence check to craft a wooden secret door, or a 
Strength check to build a working trebuchet. However , 
the proficiency bonus wouldn't apply to an ability check 
made to identify unsafe wooden construction or to 
discern the origin of a crafted item, since neither check 
requires tool use. 
SAVING THROWS AND ATTACK ROLLS 
Characters are either proficient with a saving throw 
or attack, or they aren't. The bonus always applies if a 
character is proficient. 
ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE 
Advantage and disadvantage are among the most useful 
tools in your DM's toolbox. They reflect temporary 
circumstances that might affect the chances of a 
character succeeding or failing at a task. Advantage 
is also a great way to reward a player who shows 
exceptional creativity in play. 
Characters often gain advantage or disadvantage 
through the use of special abilities, actions, spells, or 
other features of their classes or backgrounds. In other 
cases, you decide whether a circumstance influences a 
roll in one direction or another, and you grant advantage 
or impose disadvantage as a result. 
Consider granting advantage when 000 
Circumstances not related to a creature's inherent 
capabilities provide it with an edge. 
Some aspect of the environment contributes to the 
character's chance of success. 
• A player shows exceptional creativity or cunning in 
attempting or describing a task. 
• Previous actions (whether taken by the character 
making the attempt or some other creature) improve 
the chances of success. 
Consider imposing disadvantage when 000 
• Circumstances hinder success in some way. 
• Some aspect of the environment makes success less 
likely (assuming that aspect doesn't already impose a 
penalty to the roll being made). 
• An element of the plan or description of an action 
makes success less likely. 
Because advantage and disadvantage cancel each 
other out, there's no need to keep track of how many 
circumstances weigh on both sides. 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 
For example, imagine a wizard is running down a 
dungeon cor~idor to escape from a beholder. Around 
the corner ahead, two ogres lie in wait. Does the wizard 
hear the ogres readying their ambush? You look at 
the wizard's passive Wisdom (Perception) score and 
consider all the factors weighing on it. 
The wizard is running, not paying attention to what's 
ahead of him. This imposes disadvantage on the 
wizard's ability check. However , the ogres are readying 
a portcullis trap and making a lot of noise with a winch, 
which could grant the wizard advantage on the check. 
As a result, the character has neither advantage nor 
disadvantage on the Wisdom check, and you don't need 
to consider any additional factors. Past encounters with 
an ogre ambush, the fact that the wizard's ears are 
still ringing from the thunderwave spell he cast at the 
beholder, the overall noise level of the dungeon -none of 
that matters any more. They all cancel out. 
INSPIRATION 
Awarding inspiration is an effective way to encourage 
roleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the Player's 
Handbook , having inspiration gives a character an 
obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one 
ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Remember 
that a character can have no more than one inspiration 
at a time. AWARDING INSPIRATION 
Think of inspiration as a spice that you can use to 
enhance your campaign. Some DMs forgo using 
inspiration, while others embrace it as a key part of 
the game. If you take away anything from this section, 
remember this golden rule: inspiration should make the 
game more enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration 
when players take actions that make the game more 
exciting, amusing , or memorable. 
As a rule of thumb, aim to award inspiration to each 
character about once per session of play. Over time, you 
might want to award inspiration more or less often, at 
a rate that works best for your table. You might use the 
same rate for your entire DMing career, or you might 
change it with each campaign. 
Offering inspiration as a reward encourages certain 
types of behavior in your players. Think of your style as 
a DM and your group's preferences. What helps make 
the game more fun for your group? What type of action 
fit in with your campaign's style or genre? Your answer 
to those questions help determine when you award 
inspiration. 
Roleplaying. Using inspiration to reward roleplayin g 
is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a 
player with inspiration when that player causes his or 
her character to do something that is consistent with 
the character's personality trait, flaw, or bond. The 
character's action should be notable in some way. It 
might drive the story forward, push the adventurers into 
danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence. 
you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that 
makes the game more enjoyable for everyone else. 
Take into account each player's roleplaying style, and 
try not to favor one style over another. For example, 
Allison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and 
adopting her character's mannerisms , but Paul feels 
self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe 
his character ~s attitude and actions. Neither style is 
better than the other. Inspiration encourages players to 
take part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly 
makes the game better for everyone. 
Heroism. You can use inspiration to encourage 
player characters to take risks. A fighter might not 
normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the mid 
of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the 
character's daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a 
reward tells the players that you want them to embrace 
swashbuckling action. 
This approach is great for campaigns that emphasiz e 
action-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider 
allowing inspiration to be spent after a d20 roll, rather 
than before. This approach turns inspiration into a 
cushion against failure-and a guarantee that it comes 
into play only when a player is faced directly by failure. 
Such an assurance makes risky tactics less daunting. 
A Reward for Victory. Some DMs prefer to play an 
impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally 
requires a DM's judgment to award, which might 
run against your style if you like a campaign where 
you let dice determine most outcomes. If that's your 
style, consider using inspiration as a reward when 
the characters achieve an important goal or victory, 
representing a surge of confidence and energy. 
Under this model, give everyone in the party 
inspiration if the characters manage to defeat a 
powerful foe, execute a cunning plan to achieve a 
goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in 
the campaign. 
Genre Emulation. Inspiration is a handy tool for 
reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. 
Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as 
personality traits, flaws, and bonds that can apply to any 
of the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired 
by film noir, characters could have an additional flaw: 
"I can't resist helping a person I find alluring despite 
warnings that he or she is nothing but trouble." If the 
characters agree to help a suspicious but seductive 
noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue 
and betrayal, reward them with inspiration. 
Similarly , characters in a horror story typically can't 
help but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its 
secrets. They probably also go off alone when they 
shouldn't. If the party splits up, consid~r giving each 
character inspiration. 
A sensible person would avoid the noble's intrigues 
and the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, 
we're not dealing with sensible people; we're dealing 
with protagonists in a particular type of story. For this 
approach to work, create a list of your genre's main 
conventions and share it with your players. Before the 
campaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your 
group is on board for embracing those conventions. 
Players and Inspiration. Remember that a player 
with inspiration can award it to another player. Some 
groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, 
deciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It's 
best to let players award their inspiration as they see 
fit, but feel free to talk to them about following certain 
guidelines, particularly if you're trying to reinforce 
conventions of a certain genre. 
WHEN Do You AwARD INSPIRATION? 
Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some 
DMs like to award inspiration in response to an action. 
Other DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering 
inspiration while a player is considering options. Both 
approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. 
Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of 
play, but it also means players don't know whether their 
decisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the 
player can't spend the inspiration on the act that earned 
it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it 
or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This 
approach works best for groups that want to focus on 
immersion and player agency, where the DM steps 
back and gives the players more freedom to do what 
they want. 
Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration 
provides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are manipulating the players or making choices for them. 
Offering inspiration before an action works great with 
groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre 
emulation and group storytelling , where character 
freedom isn't as important as weaving a compelling 
tale together. 
Start with awarding inspiration after an action, 
especially for your first campaign or when playing with 
a new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the 
flow of play and avoids making the players feel as if you 
are being manipulative. 
TRACKING INSPIRATION 
A player typically notes on a character sheet whether 
he or she has inspiration , or you can use poker chips or 
some other token Alternatively, you can hand out special 
d20s to represent inspiration. When a player spends 
inspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands it 
back to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to 
someone else, the d20 can go to that other person. 
IGNORING INSPIRATION 
Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some 
DMs feel it adds a layer of metagame thinking , and 
others feel that heroism, roleplaying , and other parts 
of the game are their own rewards that don't need 
incentives like inspiration. 
If you choose to ignore inspiration , you're telling the 
players that your campaign is one where you let the 
dice fall where they may. It's a good option for gritty 
campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an 
impartial role as a rules arbiter. 
VARIANT : ONLY PLAYERS AWARD INSPIRATION 
As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. 
Sometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget 
to award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players 
to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every 
session, each player can award inspiration to another 
player. A player follows whatever guidelines the group 
has agreed on for awarding inspiration. 
This approach makes your life easier and also gives 
players the chance to recognize each other for good 
play. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being 
awarded fairly. 
This approach works best with groups that are 
focused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely 
manipulate it to gain advantage in key situations , 
without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying 
or whatever other criteria the group has established . 
In this variant, you can allow each player to award 
inspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the 
first time that a player awards inspiration in a session 
is free. Wheneve r that player awards it later in the same 
es ion. you gain inspiration that you can spend to give 
advantage to any foe of the player characters . There's 
no limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in 
this way. and unspent inspiration carries over from one 
session to the next. 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 
RESOLUTION AND CONSEQUENCES 
You determine the consequences of attack rolls, ability 
checks, and saving throws. In most cases, doing so is 
straightforward . When an attack hits, it deals damage. 
When a creature fails a saving throw, the creature 
suffers a harmful effect. When an ability check equals or 
exceeds the DC, the check succeeds . 
As a DM, you have a variety of flourishes and 
approaches you can take when adjudicating success and 
failure to make things a little less black-and-white. 
SuccEss AT A CosT 
Failure can be tough, but the agony is compounded 
when a character fails by the barest margin. When a 
character fails a roll by only 1 or 2, you can allow the 
character to succeed at the cost of a complication or 
hindrance. Such complications can run along any of the 
following lines: 
A character manages to get her sword past a 
hobgoblin's defenses and turn a near miss into a hit, 
but the hobgoblin twists its shield and disarms her. 
A character narrowly escapes the full brunt of a 
fireball but ends up prone. 
A character fails to intimidate a kobold prisoner, but 
the kobold reveals its secrets anyway while shrieking 
at the top of its lungs, alerting other nearby monsters. 
• A character manages to finish an arduous climb to the 
top of a cliff despite slipping, only to realize that the 
rope on which his companions dangle below him is 
close to breaking. 
When you introduce costs such as these, try to make 
them obstacles and setbacks that change the nature 
of the adventuring situation. In exchange for success, 
players must consider new ways of facing the challenge. 
You can also use this technique when a character 
succeeds on a roll by hitting the DC exactly, 
complicating marginal success in interesting ways. 
DEGREES OF FAILURE 
Sometimes a failed ability check has different 
consequences depending on the degree of failure. For 
example, a character who fails to disarm a trapped chest 
might accidentally spring the trap if the check fails by 
5 or more, whereas a lesser failure means that the trap 
wasn't triggered during the botched disarm attempt. 
Consider adding similar distinctions to other checks. 
Perhaps a failed Charisma (Persuasion) check means a 
queen won't help, whereas a failure of 5 or more means 
she throws you ir the dungeon for your impudence. 
CRITICAL SUCCESS OR FAILURE 
Rolling a 20 or a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw 
doesn't normally have any special effect. However, 
you can choose to take such an exceptional roll into 
account when adjudicating the outcome. It's up to you 
to determine how this manifests in the game. An easy 
approach is to increase the impact of the success or 
failure. For example, rolling a 1 on a failed attempt 
to pick a lock might break the thieves' tools being 
used, and rolling a 20 on a successful Intelligence 
(Investigation) check might reveal an extra clue. 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME • 
EXPLORATION 
This section provides guidance for running exploration , 
especially travel, tracking, and visibility. 
USING A MAP 
Whatever environment the adventurers are exploring, 
you can use a map to follow their progress as you relate 
the details of their travels. In a dungeon , tracking 
movement on a map lets you describe the branching 
passages , doors, chambers, and other features the 
adventurers encounter as they go, and gives the players 
the opportunity to choose their own path. Similarly, a 
wilderness map can show roads, rivers, terrain, and 
other features that might guide the characters on their 
travels-or lead them astray. 
The Map Travel Pace table helps you track travel on 
maps of different scales. The table shows how much 
distance on a map the adventurers can cover on foot 
in minutes, hours, or days. The table uses the travel 
paces-slow, normal, and fast-described in the Player's 
Handbook. Characters moving at a normal pace can 
walk about 24 miles in a day. 
MAP TRAVEL PACE 
Map Scale Slow Pace Normal Pace Fast Pace 
Dungeon 20 sq.fmin. 30 sq.fmin. 40 sq.fmin. 
(1 sq.= 10ft.) 
City 2 sq.fmin. 3 sq.fmin. 4 sq.fmin. 
(1 sq.= 100ft.) 
Province 2 hexesjhr. , 3 hexesfhr., 4 hexesjhr. , 
(1 hex= 1 mi.) 18 hexesfday 24 hexesfday 30 hexesjday 
Kingdom 1 hexf3 hr., 1 hexf2 hr., 1 hexjll/2 hr., 
(1 hex= 6 mi.) 3 hexesjday 4 hexesfday 5 hexesjday 
SPECIAL TRAVEL PACE 
The rules ori travel pace in the Player's Handbook 
assume that a group of travelers adopts a pace that, over 
time, is unaffected by the individual members' walking 
speeds. The difference between walking speeds can 
be significant during combat, but during an overland 
journey, the difference vanishes as travelers pause to 
catch their breath, the faster ones wait for the slower 
ones, and one traveler's quickness is matched by 
another traveler's endurance. 
A character bestride a phantom steed, soaring 
through the air on a carpet of flying, or riding a sailboar 
or a steam-powered gnomish contraption doesn't travel 
at a normal rate, since the magic, engine, or wind 
doesn't tire the way a creature does and the air doesn't 
contain the types of obstructions found on land. When a 
creature is traveling with a flying speed or with a speed 
granted by magic, an engine, or a natural force (such as 
wind or a water current), translate that speed into travel 
rates using the following rules: 
In 1 minute, you can move a number of feet equal to 
your speed times 10. 
In 1 hour, you can move a number of miles equal to 
your speed divided by 10. 
For daily travel, multiply your hourly rate of travel by 
the number of hours traveled (typically 8 hours). 
For a fast pace, increase the rate of travel by one-third. 
For a slow pace, multiply the rate by two-thirds. 
For example, a character under the effect of a wind 
walk spell gains a flying speed of 300 feet. In 1 minute, 
the character can move 3,000 feet at a normal pace, 
4,000 feet at a fast pace, or 2,000 feet at a slow pace. 
The character can also cover 20, 30, or 40 miles in an 
hour. The spell lasts for 8 hours, allowing the character 
to travel 160, 240, or 320 miles in a day. 
Similarly, a phantom steed spell creates a magical 
mount with a speed of 100 feet that doesn't tire like a 
real horse. A character on a phantom steed can cover 
1,000 feet in 1 minute at a normal pace, 1,333 feet at 
a fast pace, or 666 feet at a slow pace. In 1 hour, the 
character can travel 7, 10, or 13 miles. 
VISIBILITY OUTDOORS 
When traveling outdoors, characters can see about 2 
miles in any direction on a clear day, or until the point 
where trees, hills, or other obstructions block their view. Rain normally cuts maximum visibility down to 1 mile, 
and fog can cut it down to between 100 and 300 feet. 
On a clear day, the characters can see 40 miles if they 
are atop a mountain or a tall hill, or are otherwise able 
to look down on the area around them from a height. 
NOTICING OTHER CREATURES 
While exploring, characters might encounter other 
creatures. An important question in such a situation is 
who notices whom. 
Indoors, whether the sides can see one another 
usually depends on the configuration of rooms and 
passageways. Vision might also be limited by light 
sources. Outdoor visibility can be hampered by terrain, 
weather, and time of day. Creatures can be more likely 
to hear one another before they see anything . 
If neither side is being stealthy, creatures 
automatically notice each other once they are within 
sight or hearing range of one another. Otherwise , 
compare the Dexterity (Stealth) check results of the 
creatures in the group that is hiding with the passive 
Wisdom (Perception) scores of the other group, as 
explained in the Player's Handbook. 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 243 
TRACKING 
Adventurers sometimes choose their path by following 
the tracks of other creatures-or other creatures might 
track the adventurers! To track, one or more creatures 
must succeed on a Wisdom (Survival) check. You might 
require trackers to make a new check in any of the 
following circumstances: 
• They stop tracking and resume after finishing a short 
or long rest. 
The trail crosses an obstacle, such as a river, that 
shows no tracks. 
• The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way 
that makes tracking harder. 
The DC for the check depends on how well the ground 
shows signs of a creature's passage. No roll is necessary 
in situations where the tracks are obvious. For example, 
no check is needed to track an army advancing along 
a muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is 
more challenging, unless the creature being tracked 
leaves a distinct trail. Additionally, the passage of time 
often makes tracks harder to follow. In a situation where 
there is no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is 
impossible. 
The Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for setting 
the DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on 
your assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant 
advantage on the check if there's more than one set 
of tracks to follow, or disadvantage if the trail being 
followed passes through a well-trafficked area. 
On a failed check, the character loses the trail but can 
attempt to find it again by making a careful search of the 
area. It takes 10 minutes to find a trail in a confined area 
such as a dungeon , or 1 hour outdoors.

SOCIAL INTERACTION 
During a social interaction , the adventurers usually have 
a goal. They want to extract information , secure aid, 
win someone 's trust, escape punishment , avoid combat, 
negotiate a treaty, or achieve whatever other objective 
led to the interaction in the first place. The creatures 
they interact with also have agendas. 
Some DMs prefer to run a social interaction as a 
free-form roleplaying exercise, where dice rarely come 
into play. Other DMs prefer to resolve the outcome of 
an interaction by having characters make Charisma 
checks. Either approach works, and most games 
fall somewhere in between, balancing player skill 
(roleplaying and persuading) with character skill 
(reflected by ability checks). 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME RESOLVING INTERACTIONS ------
The Player's Handbook provides guidelines for 
balancing roleplaying and ability checks in a social 
interaction (see chapter 8, "Adventuring," in that book. 
This section adds to that material by providing a 
structured way to resolve a social interaction . Much of 
this structure will be invisible to your players in play aD: 
isn't meant to be a substitute for roleplaying. 
l. STARTING ATTITUDE 
Choose the starting attitude of a creature the 
adventurers are interacting with: friendly, indifferen t. 
or hostile. 
A friendly creature wants to help the adventurers 
and wishes for them to succeed. For tasks or actions 
that require no particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly 
creatures usually help without question. If an element 
personal risk is involved, a successful Charisma check 
might be required to convince a friendly creature to take 
that risk. 
An indifferent creature might help or hinder the 
party, depending on what the creature sees as most 
beneficial. A creature's indifference doesn't necessar ily 
make it standoffish or disinterested. Indifferent 
creatures might be polite and genial, surly and irritable 
or anything in between. A successful Charisma check 
is necessary when the adventurers try to persuade an 
indifferent creature to do something. 
A hostile creature opposes the adventurers and their 
goals but doesn't necessarily attack them on sight. 
For example , a condescending noble might wish to 
see a group of upstart adventurers fail so as to keep 
them from becoming rivals for the king's attention, 
thwarting them with slander and scheming rather than 
direct threats and violence. The adventurers need to 
succeed on one or more challenging Charisma checks 
to convince a hostile creature to do anything on their 
behalf. That said, a hostile creature might be so ill­
disposed toward the party that no Charisma check can 
improve its attitude, in which case any attempt to sway i· 
through diplomacy fails automatically . 
2. CONVERSATION 
Play out the conversation. Let the adventurers make 
their points, trying to frame their statements in 
terms that are meaningful to the creature they are 
interacting with. 
Changing Attitude. The attitude of a creature 
might change over the course of a conversation. If 
the adventurers say or do the right things during 
an interaction (perhaps by touching on a creature's 
ideal, bond, or flaw), they can make a hostile creature 
temporarily indifferent , or make an indifferent creature 
temporarily friendly. Likewise , a gaffe, insult, or harmful 
deed might make a friendly creature temporarily 
indifferent or turn an indifferent creature hostile. 
Whether the adventurers can shift a creature's 
attitude is up to you. You decide whether the adventurer 
have successfully couched their statements in terms 
that matter to the creature. Typically , a creature's 
attitude can't shift more than one step during a single 
interaction , whether temporarily or permanently. 
Determining Characteristics. The adventurers don't 
necessarily enter into a social interaction with a full 
understanding of a creature's ideal. bond, or flaw. If they 
want to shift a creature's attitude by playing on these 
characteristics , they first need to determine what the 
creature cares about. They can guess, but doing so runs 
the risk of shifting the creature's attitude in the wrong 
direction if they guess badly. 
After interacting with a creature long enough to get 
a sense of its personality traits and characteristics 
through conversation, an adventurer can attempt a 
Wisdom (Insight) check to uncover one of the creature's 
characteristi cs. You set the DC. A check that fails by 
10 or more might misidentify a characteristi c, so you 
should provide a false characteristic or invert one of 
the creature's existing characteristics. For example, if 
an old sage's flaw is that he is prejudiced against the 
uneducated , an adventurer who badly fails the check 
might be told that the sage enjoys personally seeing to 
the education of the downtrodden . 
Given time, adventurers can also learn about a 
creature's characteristics from other sources, including 
its friends and allies, personal letters, and publicly told 
stories. Acquiring such information might be the basis 
of an entirely different set of social interactions. 
3. CHARISMA CHECK 
When the adventurers get to the point o( their 
request, demand, or suggestion -or if you decide the 
conversation has run its course-call for a Charisma 
check. Any character who has actively participated in 
the conversation can make the check. Depending on 
how the adventurers handled the conversation , the 
Persuasion , Deception, or Intimidation skill might apply 
to the check. The creature's current attitude determines 
the DC required to achieve a specific reaction, as shown 
in the Conversation Reaction table. 
CONVERSATION REACTION 
DC Friendly Creature's Reaction 
0 The creature does as asked without taking risks or 
making sacrifices. 
10 The creature accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do 
as asked. 
20 The creature accepts a significant risk or sacrifice to 
do as asked. 
DC Indifferent Creature's Reaction 
0 The creature offers no help but does no harm. 
10 The creature does as asked as long as no risks or 
sacrifices are involved. 
20 The creature accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do 
as asked. 
DC Hostile Creature's Reaction 
0 The creature opposes the adventurers' actions and 
might take risks to do so. 
10 
20 The creature offers no help but does no harm. 
The creature does as asked as long as no risks or 
sacrifices are involved. Aiding the Check. Other characters who make 
substantial contributions to the conversation can help 
the character making the check. If a helping character 
says or does something that would influence the 
interaction in a positive way, the character making 
the Charisma check can do so with advantag e. If 
the other character inadvertently says something 
counterproductive or offensive , the character making 
the Charisma check has disadvantage on that check. 
Multiple Checks. Certain situations might call for 
more than one check, particularly if the adventurers 
come into the interaction with multiple goals. 
4. REPEAT? 
Once a Charisma check has been made, further 
attempts to influence the target of the interaction might 
be fruitless or run the risk of upsetting or angering the 
subject creature, potentially shifting its attitude toward 
hostility. Use your best judgment. For example, if the 
party's rogue says something that pushes a noble's 
attitude toward the party from indifferent to hostile, 
another character might be able to diffuse the noble's 
hostility with clever roleplaying and a successful 
Charisma (Persuasion) check. 
RoLEPLAYING 
For some DMs, roleplaying comes naturally. If it doesn't 
come naturally for you, don't worry. The main thing is 
for you to have fun portraying your NPCs and monsters 
and to amuse your players in the process. You don't 
need to be a practiced thespian or comedian to create 
drama or humor. The key is to pay attention to the story 
elements and characterizations that make your players 
laugh or feel emotionally engaged and to incorporate 
those things into your roleplaying. 
BEING THE NPC 
Imagine how a character or monster you bring to life 
would react to the adventur ers. Consider what it cares 
about. Does it have any ideals, flaws, or bonds? By 
working such things into your portrayal , you not only 
make the character or monster more believable , but you 
also enhance the sense that the adventurers are in a 
living world. 
Strive for responses and actions that introduce twists 
into the game. For example, an old woman whose family 
was killed at the hands of an evil wizard might regard 
the party's wizard with grave suspicion. 
However you roleplay a character or monster, the 
classic advice for writers holds true: show, don't tell. For 
example, rather than describe an NPC as shallow and 
self-centered , have the individual act the way you would 
expect a shallow, self-centered person to behave. The 
NPC might have off-the-cuff answers for everything, 
an over-willingness to share personal anecdotes , and a 
desperate need to make himself or herself the subject of 
every conversation. 
USING YOUR VOICE 
Most of what you say during a session will be at a 
consistent level. For dramatic effect, be ready to shout 
out a battle cry or speak in a conspiratorial whisper. 
CHAPTER 8 / RUNNING THE GAME 245 
Also, characters and monsters with distinctive voices 
are memorable. If you're not a natural mimic or actor, 
borrowing distinctive speech patterns from real life, the 
movies, or television is a good place to start. Practice 
different voices and impersonations of famous people, 
then use those voices to bring your NPCs to life. 
Experiment with different speech patterns. For 
instance, a barmaid and a city magistrate probably use 
their words differently. Similarly, peasants could speak 
in earthy dialects, while rich folk talk in haughty drawls. 
Let a pirate NPC say, "Arrrr, maties!" in your best Long 
John Silver voice. Let intelligent monsters unfamiliar 
with Common stumble along with awkward grammar. 
Let drunkards and monsters mutter with slurred 
speech, while lizardfolk hiss their threats. 
In any interaction with multiple NPCs, make sure 
the adventurers remain the focus. Have the NPCs talk 
to them, not so much to each other. If possible, let one 
NPC do most of the talking, but if multiple NPCs need 
to talk, give them distinct voices so the players know 
who's who. 
UsiNG YouR FAcE AND ARMS 
Use your facial expressions to help show a character's 
emotions. Scowl, smile, grin, snarl, pout, cross your 
eyes-do whatever it takes to make the character or 
monster memorable to the players. When you combine 
facial expressions with an unusual voice, a character 
truly comes to life. 
Though you don't need to stand up out of your chair, 
you can use your arms to bring even more life to an 
NPC. A noble could chop the air with one hand while 
speaking in a deadpan monotone, while an archmage 
might express her displeasure by silently rolling her 
eyes and massaging her temples with her fingers. 
ENGAGING THE PLAYERS 
Some players enjoy roleplaying and interaction more 
than others. Whatever your players' tastes, your 
lively portrayal of NPCs and monsters can inspire 
players to make just as much investment in portraying 
their characters. This makes social interactions an 
opportunity for everyone to become more immersed 
in the game, creating a story whose protagonists 
have depth. 
To make sure everyone has something to do during a 
roleplaying-heavy game session, consider one or more of 
the following approaches. 
Appeal to Player Preferences. There are in-game 
activities that players enjoy more than others, as 
discussed in this book's introduction. Players who like 
acting thrive in interaction situations, and it's fine to·let 
those players take the spotlight. They often inspire other 
players by their example , but make sure those other 
players have an opportunity to join in the fun. 
Players who like exploring and storytelling are 
usually amenable to roleplaying, as long as it moves the 
campaign forward and reveals more about the world. 
Players who like problem-solving often enjoy figuring 
out the right thing to say to shift an NPC's attitude. 
Players who are instigators like provoking reactions 
from NPCs, so they're often easily engaged-though not 
always productively . 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME Players who like to optimize their characters and 
slay monsters also like to argue, and having conflict 
within an interaction can help those players embrace 
roleplaying. Still, creating combat connections to an 
extended interaction (such as a corrupt vizier sending 
assassins to kill the adventurers) is often the best way r 
keep action-focused players engaged. 
Target Specific Characters. Create situations where 
characters who might not otherwise be engaged with a 
social interaction have to do at least some of the talk in 
Perhaps the NPC in question is a family member or 
a contact of a particular adventurer and talks only to 
that character. An NPC of a certain race or class mighr 
listen only to characters he or she feels a kinship with. 
Creating a sense of importance can be a great way to ge­
specific players engaged, but don't shut out players who 
are already roleplaying. 
If a couple of players are dominating the conversati on 
take a moment now and then to involve the others. You 
can do this in character if you like: "And what about you;­
hulking friend? Speak, barbarian! What will you pledge 
in exchange for my favor?" Or just ask the player what 
his or her character is doing while the conversat ion is 
going on. The first approach is better for players who are 
already comfortable speaking in their characters' voices 
The second approach works better for players who neeri 
encouragement to engage in a roleplaying scenario. 
OBJECTS 
When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a 
window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard and 
fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, 
characters can destroy any destructible object. Use 
common sense when determining a character's succe 
at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a 
section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is 
likely to break before the wall does. 
For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete. 
inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, 
table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is 
compose d of many other objects. 
STATISTICS FOR OBJECTS 
When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class 
and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give 
it immunities , resistanc es, and vulnerabilities to specific 
types of damage. 
Armor Class. An object's Armor Class is a measure 
of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when 
striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging 
out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides 
suggested AC values for various substances. 
OBJECT ARMOR CLASS 
Substance AC Substance AC 
Cloth, paper, rope 11 I ron, steel 19 
Crystal, glass, ice 13 Mithral 21 
Wood, bone 15 Adamantine 23 
Stone 17 
Hit Points. An object's hir points measure how much 
damage it can take before lo ina i srrucrural integrity. 
Resilient objects have more hir pain than fragile ones. 
Large objects also tend to ha\·e more hir points than 
small ones, unless breaking a small part of rhe object is 
just as effective as breaking the whole rhing. The Object 
Hit Points table provides suggested hir points for fragile 
and resilient objects that are Large or smaller. 
OBJECT HIT POINTS 
Size

Small (chest, lute) 
Medium (barrel, chandelier) 
Large (cart, 10-ft.·by-10-ft. window) Fragile

5 (1d10) Resilient 
5 (2d4) 
10 (3d6) 
18 (4d8) 
27 (5d10) 
Huge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are 
of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, 
such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or 
massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge 
tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus 
to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's 
hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long 
the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is 
acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, 
divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each 
section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those 
sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a 
Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when 
one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points. 
Objects and Damage Types. Objects are immune 
to poison and psychic damage. You might decide 
that some damage types are more effective against a 
particular object or substance than others. For example, 
bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things 
but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or 
cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning 
damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively 
cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment. 
Damage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls 
often have extra resilience represented by a damage 
threshold. An object with a damage threshold has 
immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount 
of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or 
greater than its damage threshold, in which case it 
takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet 
or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered 
superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points. 
COMBAT 
This section builds on the combat rules in the Player's 
Handbook and offers tips for keeping the game running 
smoothly when a fight breaks out. 
TRACKING INITIATIVE 
You can use several different methods for keeping track 
of who goes when in combat. 
HIDDEN LIST 
Many DMs keep track of initiative on a list the players 
can't see: usually a piece of paper behind a DM screen or a spreadsheet on a tablet computer. This method 
allows you to keep track of combatants who haven't been 
revealed yet, and you can use the initiative list as a place 
to record the current hit points of monsters, as well as 
other useful notes. 
A downside of this approach is that you have to remind 
the players round after round when their turns come up. 
VISIBLE LIST 
You can use a whiteboard to track initiative. As the 
players tell you their initiative numbers , write them on 
the whiteboard in order from highest to lowest, leaving 
space between each name. Either write the monsters ' 
initiatives on the list at the same time or add them to the 
list on each monster's first turn. 
As a further improvement, use magnets that you can 
attach to a metal-based whiteboard with characters' and 
monsters ' names written on them, or write those names 
on cards held in place by magnets . 
A visible list lets everyone see the order of play. 
Players know when their turns are coming up, and they 
can start planning their actions in advance. A visible list 
also removes any uncertainty about when the monsters 
will act in the fight. 
A variation on the visible list is to give one player 
responsibility for keeping track of initiative, either on 
a white board or on a piece of paper the other players 
can see. This method reduces the number of things you 
need to keep track of yourself. 
INDEX CARDS 
In this approach, each character gets an index card, as 
does each group of identical monsters. When the players 
tell you their initiative numbers, write the numbers on 
their characters' index cards. Do the same when you roll 
the monsters' initiative. Then arrange the cards in order 
from highest to lowest. Starting at the top, you move 
down through the stack. When you call out the name of 
the character whose turn it is, also mention who's next, 
prompting that player to start thinking ahead. After 
each character or group of monsters acts, the top card is 
moved to the bottom of the stack. 
At first, players don't know the order of play when 
you use combat cards, and they don't know where the 
monsters fall into the order until the monsters act. 
TRACKING MONSTER HIT POINTS 
During a combat encounter, you need to track how much 
damage each monster takes. Most DMs track damage 
in secret so that their players don't know how many hit 
points a monster has remaining. Whether you choose to 
be secretive or not is up to you. What's important is that 
every monster's hit points be tracked individually. 
Tracking damage for one or two monsters isn't 
onerous, but it helps to have a system for larger 
groups of monsters . If you aren't using miniatures 
or other visual aids, the easiest way to keep track 
of your monsters is to assign them unique features. 
Descriptions such as "the ogre with the nasty scar" 
and "the ogre with the horned helm" help you and your 
players track which monster is which. For example, 
imagine that you're running an encounter with three 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 247 
25 
2o 
to 
5 ogres, each of which has 59 hit points. Once initiative 
is rolled, jot down each ogre's hit points and add notes 
(and even a name, if you like) to differentiate each one: 
Krag (ogre wf scar): 59 
Thod (ogre wf helm): 59 
Mur (ogre who smells like poo): 59 
If you use miniatures to represent monsters , one 
easy way to differentiate them is to give each one a 
unique miniature. If you use identical miniatures to 
represent multiple monsters, you can tag the miniatures 
with small stickers of different colors or stickers with 
different letters or numbers on them. 
For example, in a combat encounter with three ogres, 
you could use three identical ogre miniatures tagged 
with stickers marked A, B, and C, respectively. To track 
the ogres' hit points, you can sort them by letter, then 
subtract damage from their hit points as they take it. 
Your records might look something like this after a few 
rounds of combat: 
Ogre A: 59~ 45 ~ t4 9 dead 
Ogre B: 59 5t 30 
Ogre C: 59 
Players often ask how hurt a monster looks. Don't ever 
feel as though you need to reveal exact hit points, but if 
a monster is below half its hit point maximum, it's fair to 
say that it has visible wounds and appears beaten down. 
You can describe a monster taken to half its hit points as 
bloodied, giving the players a sense of progress in a fight 
against a tough opponent , and helping them judge when 
to use their most powerful spells and abilities. 
TtNY 
SMALL USING AND TRACKING CONDITIONS 
Various rules and features in the game are clear abour 
when they apply a condition to a creature. You can also 
apply conditions on the fly. They're meant to be intuitiYe 
for you to do so. For example, if a character is in a state 
such as sleep, that lacks consciousness , you can say 
the character is unconscious. Or did a character just 
stumble onto the ground? He or she is now prone. 
Keeping track of conditions can become tricky. 
For monsters, it's often easiest to track conditions on 
combat cards or wherever you track initiative. Players 
should remember any conditions affecting their 
characters. Because players have incentive to forget or 
overlook hampering conditions, character conditions 
can also be marked on combat cards or a whiteboard. 
You might also try keeping a supply of index cards on 
hand, marked with conditions and their effects. Then 
hand the cards to players as the conditions come up. 
Having a bright pink index card on top of a character 
sheet can help even the most absentminded player 
remember the effects of being charmed or frightened. 
MONSTERS AND CRITICAL HITS 
A monster follows the same rule for critical hits as 
a player, character. That said, if you use a monster's 
average damage, rather than rolling, you might wonder 
how to handle a critical hit. When the monster scores 
a critical hit, roll all the damage dice associated with 
the hit and add them to the average damage. For 
example, if a goblin normally deals 5 (ld6 + 2) slashing 
damage on a hit and scores a critical hit, it deals 5 + ld6 
slashing damage.

IMPROVISING DAMAGE 
A monster or effect typically specifies the amount of 
damage it deals. In some cases, though, you need to 
determine damage on the fly. The Improvising Damage 
table gives you suggestions for when you do so.

The Damage Severity and Level table is a guide to 
how deadly these damage numbers are for characters 
of various levels. Cross-reference a character's level 
with the damage being dealt to gauge the severity of 
the damage. 
DAMAGE SEVERITY AND LEVEL 
Character level Setback Dangerous Deadly 
1st-4th 1d10 2d10 4d10

17th-20th 10d10 18d10 24d10 
Damage sufficient to cause a setback rarely poses 
a risk of death to characters of the level shown, but 
a severely weakened character might be laid low by 
this damage. liuGE GARGANTUAN 
In contrast, dangerous damage values pose a 
significant threat to weaker characters and could 
potentially kill a characte r of the level shown if that 
character is missing many hit points. 
As the name suggests, deadly damage is enough 
to drop a character of the level shown to 0 hit points. 
This level of damage can kill even powerful characters 
outright if they are already wounded. 
ADJUDICATING AREAS OF EFFECT 
Many spells and other game features create areas of 
effect, such as the cone and the sphere. If you're not 
using miniatures or another visual aid, it can sometimes 
be difficult to determine who's in an area of effect and 
who isn't. The easiest way to address such uncertainty 
is to go with your gut and make a call. 
If you would like more guidance, consider using 
the Targets in Areas of Effect table. To use the table, 
imagine which combata nts are near one another, and 
let the table guide you in determining the number of 
those combatants that are caught in an area of effect. 
Add or subtract targets based on how bunched up the 
potential targets are. Consider rolling 1d3 to determine 
the amount to add or subtract. 
TARGETS IN AREAS OF EFFECT

Size-;-10 (round up) 
Size-;-5 (round up) 
Radius-;-5 (round up) 
Length-;- 30 (round up) 
Radius-;-5 (round up) 
For example, if a wizard directs burning hands (a 
15-foot cone) at a nearby group of orcs, you could use 
the table and say that two orcs are targeted (15 + 10 
= 1.5, rounded up to 2). Similarly, a sorcerer could 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNN lNG THE GAME 249 
launch a lightning bolt (100-foot line) at some ogres 
and hobgoblins, and you could use the table to say 
four of the monsters are targeted (100 + 30 = 3.33, 
rounded up to 4). 
This approach aims at simplicity instead of spatial 
precision. If you prefer more tactical nuance, consider 
using miniatures . 
HANDLING MOBS 
Keeping combat moving along at a brisk pace can be 
difficult when there are dozens of monsters involved 
in a battle. When handling a crowded battlefield , you 
can speed up play by forgoing attack rolls in favor of 
approximating the average number of hits a large group 
of monsters can inflict on a target. 
Instead of rolling an attack roll, determine the 
minimum d20 roll a creature needs in order to hit a 
target by subtracting its attack bonus from the target's 
AC. You'll need to refer to the result throughout the 
battle, so it's best to write it down. 
Look up the minimum d20 roll needed on the Mob 
Attacks table. The table shows you how many creatures 
that need that die roll or higher must attack a target 
in order for one of them to hit. If that many creatures 
attack the target, their combined efforts result in one of 
them hitting the target. 
For example, eight orcs surround a fighter. The orcs' 
attack bonus is +5, and the fighter's AC is 19. The orcs 
need a 14 or higher to hit the fighter. According to the 
table, for every three orcs that attack the fighter, one 
of them hits. There are enough orcs for two groups of 
three. The remaining two orcs fail to hit the fighter. 
If the attacking creatures deal different amounts 
of damage, assume that the creature that deals the 
most damage is the one that hits. If the creature that 
hits has multiple attacks with the same attack bonus, 
assume that it hits once with each of those attacks. If a 
creature's attacks have different attack bonuses, resolve 
each attack separately . 
This attack resolution system ignores critical hits in

USING MINIATURES 
In combat, players can often rely on your descriptio n 
to visualize where their characters are in relation to 
their surroundings and their enemies. Some complex 
battles, however, are easier to run with visual aids, the 
most common of which are miniatures and a grid. If y 
like to construct model terrain, build three-dimensi on 
dungeons , or draw maps on large vinyl mats, you sho -
also consider using miniatures. 
The Player's Handbook offers simple rules for 
depicting combat using miniature figures on a grid. T'--
section expands on that material. 
TACTICAL MAPS 
You can draw tactical maps with colored markers on a 
wet-erase vinyl mat with l-inch squares, on a large sh -
of paper, or on a similar flat surface. Preprinted poster­
sized maps, maps assembled from cardboard tiles, anc. 
terrain made of sculpted plaster or resin are also fun. 
The most common unit for tactical maps is the 5-foo:: 
square, and maps with grids are readily available and 
easy to create. However , you don't have to use a grid a 
all. You can track distances with a tape measure , string 
craft sticks, or pipe cleaners cut to specific lengths. 
Another option is a play surface covered by l-inch 
hexagons (often called hexes), which combines the eas_ 
counting of a grid with the more flexible movement of 
using no grid. Dungeon corridors with straight walls 
and right angles don't map easily onto hexes, though.

CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 
CREATURE SIZE ON SQUARES A D HEXES 
A creature's size determin es how much space it 
occupies on squares or hexes, as shown in the Creature 
Size and Space table. If the miniature you use for a 
monster takes up an amount of space different from 
what's on the table, that's fine, but treat the monster 
as its official size for all other rules. For example, 
you might use a miniature that has a Large base to 
represent a Huge giant. That giant takes up less space 
on the battlefield than its size suggests , but it is still 
Huge for the purposes of rules like grappling. 
CREATURE SIZE AND SPACE 
Size Space: Squares Space: Hexes 
Tiny 4 per square 4 per hex 
Small 1 square 1 hex 
Medium 1 square 1 hex 
Large 4 squares (2 by 2) 3 hexes 
Huge 9 squares (3 by 3) 7 hexes 
Gargantuan 16 squares (4 by 4) or more 12 hexes or more 
AREAS OF EFFECT 
The area of effect of a spell, monster ability, or other 
feature must be translated onto squares or hexes to 
determine which potential targets are in the area and 
which aren't. 
Choose an intersection of squares or hexes as the 
point of origin of an area of effect, then follow its rules 
as normal. If an area of effect is circular and covers at 
least half a square, it affects that square. 
LINE OF SIGHT 
To precisely determine whether there is line of sight 
between two spaces, pick a corner of one space and 
rrace an imaginary line from that corner to any part 
of another space. If at least one such line doesn't pass 
through or touch an object or effect that blocks vision­
such as a stone wall, a thick curtain, or a dense cloud of 
fog-then there is line of sight. 
COVER 
To determine whether a target has cover against an 
attack or other effect on a grid, choose a corner of the anacker's space or the point of origin of an area of effect. 
Then trace imaginary lines from that corner to every 
corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or 
two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle (including 
another creature), the target has half cover. If three or 
four of those lines are blocked but the attack can still 
reach the target (such as when the target is behind an 
arrow slit), the target has three-quarters cover. 
On hexes, use the same procedure as a grid, drawing 
lines between the corners of the hexagons. The target 
has half cover if up to three lines are blocked by an 
obstacle, and three-quarters cover if four or more lines 
are blocked but the attack can still reach the target. 
OPTIONAL RULE: FLANKING 
If you regularly use miniatures , flanking gives 
combatants a simple way to gain advantage on attack 
rolls against a common enemy. 
A creature can't flank an enemy that it can't see. A 
creature also can't flank while it is incapacitated. A 
Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least 
one square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking. 
Flanking on Squares. When a creature and at 
least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on 
opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they 
flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on 
melee attack rolls against that enemy. 
When in doubt about whether two creatures flank 
an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between 
the centers of the creatures ' spaces. If the line passes 
through opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, 
the enemy is flanked. 
Flanking on Hexes. When a creature and at least one 
of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite 
sides of the enemy's space, they flank that enemy, and 
each of them has advantage on attack rolls against 
that enemy. On hexes, count around the enemy from 
one creature to its ally. Against a Medium or smaller 
creature, the allies flank if there are 2 hexes between 
them. Against a Large creature , the allies flank if there 
are 4 hexes between them. Against a Huge creature, 
they must have 5 hexes between them. Against a 
Gargantuan creature, they must have at least 6 hexes 
between them.

CHAPTER 8 I RUNNlNG THE GAME 
OPTIONAL RULE: DIAGONALS 
The Player's Handbook presents a simple method for 
counting movement and measuring range on a grid: 
count every square as 5 feet, even if you're moving 
diagonally . Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws 
of geometry and is inaccurate over long distances. This 
optional rule provides more realism, but it requires 
more effort during combat. 
When measuring range or moving diagonally on a 
grid, the first diagonal square counts as 5 feet, but the 
second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern 
of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you're 
counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or 
vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. 
For example, a character might move one square 
diagonally (5 feet), then three squares straight (15 feet), 
and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total 
movement of 30 feet. 
OPTIONAL RuLE: FACING 
If you want the precision of knowing which way a 
creature is facing, consider using this optional rule. 
Whenever a creature ends its move, it can change its 
facing. Each creature has a front arc (the direction it 
faces), left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature 
can also change its facing as a reaction when any other 
creature moves. 
A creature can normally target only creatures in its 
front or side arcs. It can't see into its rear arc. This 
means an attacker in the creature's rear arc makes 
attack rolls against it with advantage . 
Shields apply their bonus to AC only against attacks 
from the front arc or the same side arc as the shield. For 
example, a fighter with a shield on the left arm can use it 
only against attacks from the front and left arcs. 
Feel free to determine that not all creatures have 
every type of arc. For example, an amorphous ochre 
jelly could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a 
hydra might have three front arcs and one rear one. 
On squares, you pick one side of a creature's space 
as the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line 
outward from each corner of this side to determine the 
squares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space 
determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining 
spaces to either side of the creature form its side arcs. 
On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs 
requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature's 
space and create a wedge shape expanding out from 
there for the front arc, and another on the opposite side 
of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to 
either side of the creature are its side arcs. 
A square or hex might be in more than one arc, 
depending on how you draw the lines from a creature's 
space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one 
arc, it is in that arc. If it is split exactly down the middle, 
use this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it's in that 
arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it's in 
the side arc. 
CHAPTER 8 \ RUNNING THE GAME ADJUDICATING REACTION TIMING 
Typical combatants rely on the opportunity attack 
and the Ready action for most of their reactions in a 
fight. Various spells and features give a creature more 
reaction options, and sometimes the timing of a reacti -
can be difficult to adjudicate. Use this rule of thumb: 
follow whatever timing is specified in the reaction's 
description . For example, the opportunity attack and 
the shield spell are clear about the fact that they can 
interrupt their triggers. If a reaction has no timing 
specified , or the timing is unclear, the reaction occurs 
after its trigger finishes, as in the Ready action. 
CHASES 
Strict application of the movement rules can turn a 
potentially exciting chase into a dull, predictable affair. 
Faster creatures always catch up to slower ones, while 
creatures with the same speed never close the distance 
between each other. This set of rules can make chase 
more exciting by introducing random elements. 
BEGINNING A CHASE 
A chase requires a quarry and at least one pursuer. Any 
participants not already in initiative order must roll 
initiative. As in combat, each participant in the chase 
can take one action and move on its turn. The chase 
ends when one side drops out or the quarry escapes. 
When a chase begins, determine the starting 
distance between the quarry and the pursuers. Track 
the distance between them, and designate the pursuer 
closest to the quarry as the lead. The lead pursuer migh· 
change from round to round. 
RUNNING THE CHASE 
Participants in the chase are strongly motivated to use 
the Dash action every round. Pursuers who stop to casr 
spells and make attacks run the risk of losing their 
quarry, and a quarry that does so is likely to be caught. 
DASHING 
During the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash 
action a number of times equal to 3 +its Constitution 
modifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during 
the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 
Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one !eve. 
of exhaustion. 
A participant drops out of the chase if its exhaustion 
reaches level 5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature 
can remove the levels of exhaustion it gained during the 
chase by finishing a short or long rest. 
SPELLS AND ATTACKS 
A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells 
against other creatures within range. Apply the 
normal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to the attacks 
and spells. 
Chase participants can't normally make opportunity 
attacks against each other, since they are all assumed 
to be moving in the same direction at the same time. 
However, participants can till be -· e rarge of 
opportunity attacks from creatw .: o participating 
in the chase. For example. ad,·en -e -ho chase a 
thief past a gang of thugs in an alley might provoke 
opportunity attacks from the thug . 
ENDING A CHASE 
A chase ends when one side or the other tops, when the 
quarry escapes, or when the pursuer are close enough 
to their quarry to catch it. 
If neither side gives up the cha e. the quarry makes a 
Dexterity (Stealth) check at the end of each round, after 
every participant in the chase ha taken its turn. The 
result is compared to the passive\ isdom (Perception) 
scores of the pursuers. If the quarry consists of multiple 
creatures, they all make the check. 
If the quarry is never out of the lead pursuer's sight, 
the check fails automaticall y. Otherwise, if the result of 
the quarry's check is greater than the highest passive 
score, that quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues 
for another round. 
The quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on its 
check based on prevailing circumstances, as shown in 
the Escape Factors table. If one or more factors give the 
quarry both advantage and disadvantage on its check, 
the quarry has neither, as usual. 
EscAPE FACTORS

Other factors might help or hinder the quarry's ability 
to escape, at your discretion. For example, a quarry with 
a faerie fire spell cast on it might have disadvantage on 
checks made to escape because it's much easier to spot. 
Escape doesn't necessarily mean the quarry has 
outpaced its pursuers. For example, in an urban 
setting, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a 
crowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to 
where it went. 
CHASE COMPLICATIONS 
As with any good chase scene, complications can arise 
to make a chase more pulse-pounding. The Urban 
Chase Complications table and the Wilderness Chase 
Complications table provide several examples. 
Complications occur randomly. Each participant in 
the chase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the 
appropriate table to determine whether a complication 
occurs. If it does, it affects the next chase participant in 
the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the 
die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant 
affected by the complication can spend inspiration to 
negate the complication. 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 253 
254 Characters can create their own complica tions to 
shake off pursuers (for example, casting the web spell in 
a narrow alleyway). Adjudicate these as you see fit. 
URBAN CHASE COMPLICATIONS

The DM chooses a creature appropriate for the 
terrain. 
11-20 No complication. 
DESIGNING YouR OwN CHASE TABLES 
The tables presented here don't work for all possible 
environments. A chase through the sewers of 
Baldur's Gate or through the spiderweb-filled alleys 
of Menzoberranzan might inspire you to create your 
own table. 
SPLITTING UP 
Creatures being chased can split up into smaller groups. 
This tactic forces pursuers to either divide their forces 
or allow some of the quarry to escape. If a pursuit 
splits into several smaller chases, resolve each chase 
separately. Run a round of one chase, then a round of 
the next, and so on, tracking the distances for each 
separate group. 
MAPPING THE CHASE 
If you have the opportunity to plan out a chase, take 
the time to draw a rough map that shows the route. 
Insert obstacles at specific points, especially ones that 
require the characters to make ability checks or saving 
throws to avoid slowing or stopping, or use a random 
table of complications similar to the ones in this section. 
Otherwise, improvise as you play. 
Complications can be barriers to progress or 
opportunities for mayhem . Characters being chased 
through a forest by bugbears might spot a wasp nest 
and slow down long enough to attack the nest or throw 
rocks at it, thus creating an obstacle for their pursuers . 
A map of a chase can be linear or have many 
branches, depending on the nature of the chase. For 
example, a mine cart chase might have few (if any) 
branches, while a sewer chase might have several. 
ROLE REVERSAL 
During a chase, it's possible for the pursuers to become 
the quarry. For example, characters chasing a thief 
through a marketplace might draw unwanted attention 
from other members of the thieves' guild. As they 
pursue the fleeing thief, they must also evade the thieves 
pursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and 
run both chases simultaneously. In another scenario, 
the fleeing thief might run into the waiting arms of his 
accomplices. The outnumbered characters might decide 
to flee with the thieves in pursuit. 
SIEGE EQUIPMENT 
Siege weapons are designed to assail castles and other 
walled fortifications. They see much use in campaigns 
that feature war. Most siege weapons don't move around 
a battlefield on their own; they require creatures to move 
them, as well as to load, aim, and fire them.

DISEASES 
A plague ravages the kingdom , setting the adventurer s 
on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from 
an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries , and soon 
finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock 
offends some dark power and contracts a strange 
affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells. 
A simple outbreak might amount to little more than 
a small drain on party resources , curable by a casting 
of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can 
form the basis of one or more adventures as character s 
search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and 
deal with the consequences. 
A disease that does more than infect a few party 
members is primarily a plot device. The rules help 
describe the effects of the disease and how it can be 
cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't 
bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect 
any creature, and a given illness might or might not 
pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A 
plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep 
through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races 
untouched . What matters is the story you want to tell. 
SAMPLE DISEASES 
The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease 
can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving 
throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms , and other 
characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign. 
~ACKLE FEVER 
-:-his disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are 
:;rrangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, 
·ctims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, 
giving the disease its common name and its morbid 
::Uckname: "the shrieks." 
Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and 
mclude fever and disorientation. The infected creature 
gains one level of exhaustion that can't be removed until 
Lhe disease is cured. 
Any event that causes the infected creature great 
-rress-including entering combat, taking damage, 
experiencing fear, or having a nightmare -forces the 
creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. 
Dna failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic 
damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter 
or 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw 
ar the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter 
and the incapacitated condition on a success. 
Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 
ieet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter 
must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or 
also become infected with the disease. Once a creature 
ucceeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter 
of that particular infected creature for 24 hours. 
At the end of each long rest, an infected creature 
can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a 
uccessful save, the DC for this save and for the save to 
avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the 
aving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from 
rhe disease. A creature that fails three of these saving 
rhrows gains a randomly determined form of indefinite 
madness, as described later in this chapter. 
SEWER PLAGUE 
Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category 
of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, 
and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes 
transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such 
as rats and otyughs. 
When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that 
carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with 
filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature 
must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or 
become infected. 
It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to 
manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include 
fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one 
level of exhaustion , and it regains only half the normal 
number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit 
points from finishing a long rest. 
At the end of each long rest, an infected creature 
must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a 
failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. 
On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level 
decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw 
reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 
1, the creature recovers from the disease. 
SIGHT RoT 
This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and 
eventually blinds the victim. A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by 
sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw or become infected. One day after infection, the 
creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature 
takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks 
that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the 
symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When 
it reaches -5, the victim is blinded until its sight is 
restored by magic such as Jesser restoration or heal. 
Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called 
Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, 
a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit 
can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied 
to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents 
the disease from worsening after that rest. After three 
doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely. 
PorsoNs 
Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are 
illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among 
assassins, draw, and other evil creatures. 
Poisons come in the following four types. 
Contact. A creature that touches contact poison with 
exposed skin suffers its effects. 
Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of 
ingested poison to suffer its effects. You might decide 
that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing 
advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half 
damage on a failed save. 
Inhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that 
take effect when they are inhaled. A single dose fills a 
5-foot cube. 
Injury. A creature that takes slashing or piercing 
damage from a weapon or piece of ammunition coated 
with injury poison is exposed to its effects.

SAMPLE POISONS -------
Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects. 
Assassin's Blood (Ingested). A creature subjected 
to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving 
throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison damage 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 257 
and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the 
creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned. 
Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled). A creature subjected 
to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution 
saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must 
repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. 
On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 
(1d6) poison damage. After three successful saves, the 
poison ends. 
Carrion Crawler Mucus (Contact). This poison 
must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated 
carrion crawler. A creature subjected to this poison 
must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw 
or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is 
paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at 
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on 
a success. 
Drow Poison (Injury). This poison is typically made 
only by the draw, and only in a place far removed from 
sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must 
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be 
poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or 
more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned 
in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or 
if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. 
Essence of Ether (Inhaled). A creature subjected 
to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The 
poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes 
up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an 
action to shake it awake. 
Malice (Inhaled). A creature subjected to this poison 
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw 
or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature 
is blinded. 
Midnight Tears (Ingested). A creature that ingests 
this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. 
If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the 
creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving 
throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, 
or half as much damage on a successful one. 
Oil ofTaggit (Contact). A creature subjected to this 
poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving 
throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned 
creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it 
takes damage. 
Pale Tincture (Ingested). A creature subjected to this 
poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving 
throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become 
poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving 
throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damag<: 
on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage 
the poison deals can't be healed by any means. After 
seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the 
creature can heal normally . 
Purple Worm Poison (Injury). This poison must be 
harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple worm. 
A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 
19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME Serpent Venom (Injury). This poison must be 
harvested from a dead or incapacitated giant poisonou 
snake. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed 
on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) 
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
on a successful one. 
Torpor (Ingested). A creature subjected to this poison 
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or 
become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature 
is incapacitated. 
Truth Serum (Ingested). A creature subjected to thi 
poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving 
throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned 
creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if under the 
effect of a zone of truth spell. 
Wyvern Poison (Injury). This poison must be 
harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern. A 
creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 
15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. 
PURCHASING POISON 
In some settings, strict laws prohibit the possession 
and use of poison, but a black-market dealer or 
unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. 
Characters with criminal contacts might be able to 
acquire poison relatively easily. Other characters might 
have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before 
they track down the poison they seek. 
The Poisons table gives suggested prices for single 
doses of various poisons. 
CRAFTING AND HARVESTING POISO -
During downtime between adventures, a character 
can use the crafting rules in the Player's Handbook to 
create basic poison if the character has proficiency with 
a poisoner's kit At your discretion , the character can 
craft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients 
are available for purchase, and tracking down certain 
ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventur e. 
A character can instead attempt to harvest poison 
from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or 
carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or 
dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed 
by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency 
with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the 
character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a 
successful check, the character harvests enough poison 
for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is 
unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the 
check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the 
creature's poison. 
MADNESS 
In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad 
by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict 
day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an 
adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign 
has a strong horror theme, you might want to use 
madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing 
the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the 
adventurers face. 
GOING MAD 
Various magical effects can inflict madness on an 
otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact 
other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can 
use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects 
in the Player's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar 
effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of 
Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts 
can also break the psyche of a character who uses or 
becomes attuned to them. 
Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires 
a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game 
includes the Sanity score (see chapter 9, "Dungeon 
Master's Workshop "), a creature makes a Sanity saving 
throw instead. 
MADNESS EFFECTS -----
Madness can be short-term , long-term, or indefinite. 
Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term 
madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More 
horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long­
term or indefinite madness. 
A character afflicted with short-term madness is 
subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness 
table for ldlO minutes. 
A character afflicted with long-term madness is 
subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness 
table for ldlO x 10 hours. 
A character afflicted with indefinite madness gains 
a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table 
that lasts until cured. 
SHORT-TERM MADNESS 
dlOO Effect (lasts ldlO minutes) 
01-20 The character retreats into his or her mind and 
becomes paralyzed . The effect ends if the character 
takes any damage. 
21-30 The character becomes incapacitated and spends 
the duration screaming, laughing, or weeping. 
31-40 The character becomes frightened and must use 
his or her action and movement each round to flee 
from the source of the fear. 
41-50 The character begins babbling and is incapable of 
normal speech or spellcasting . 
51-60 The character must use his or her action each 
round to attack the nearest creature. 
61-70 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and 
has disadvantage on ability checks. 
71-75 The character does whatever anyone tells him or 
her to do that isn't obviousl y self-destruct ive. 
76-80 The character experiences an overpower ing urge to 
eat something strange such as dirt, slime, or offal. 
81-90 The character is stunned. 
91-100 The character falls unconsc ious. 
LONG-TERM MADNESS 
dlOO Effect (lasts ldlO x 10 hours) 
01-10 The character feels compelled to repeat a specific 
activity over and over, such as washing hands, 
touching things, praying, or counting coins. 
11-20 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and 
has disadvantage on ability checks. 
21-30 The character suffers extreme paranoia. The 
character has disadvantage on Wisdom and 
Charisma checks. 
31-40 The character regards something (usually the 
source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if 
affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/ 
sympathy spell. 
41-45 The character experiences a powerful delusion. 
Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or 
she is under its effects. 
46-55 The character becomes attached to a "lucky 
charm," such as a person or an object, and has 
disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and 
saving throws while more than 30 feet from it. 
56-65 The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%). 
66-75 The character experiences uncontrollable tremors 
or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack 
rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve 
Strength or Dexterity. 
76-85 The character suffers from partial amnesia. The 
character knows who he or she is and retains racial 
traits and class features, but doesn't recognize 
other people or remember anything that happened 
before the madness took effect. 
86-90 Whenever the character takes damage, he or she 
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw 
or be affected as though he or she failed a saving 
throw against the confusion spell. The confusion 
effect lasts for 1 minute. 
91-95 The character loses the ability to speak. 
96-100 The character falls unconscious . No amount of 
jostling or damage can wake the character. 
CURING MADNESS 
A calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of 
madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid 
a character of a short-term or long-term madness. 
Depending on the source of the madness , remove 
curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater 
restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to 
rid a character of indefinite madness. 
EXPERIENCE POINTS 
Experience points (XP) fuel level advancement for 
player characters and are most often the reward for 
completing combat encounters. 
Each monster has an XP value based on its 
challenge rating. When adventurers defeat one or more 
monsters-typically by killing, routing, or capturing

31-35 "I must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie 
to be interesting to other people." 
36-45 "Achieving my goal is the only thing of interest to

them-they divide the total XP value of the monsters 
evenly among themselves. If the party received 
substantial assistance from one or more NPCs, count 
those NPCs as party members when dividing up the 
XP. (Because the NPCs made the fight easier, individual 
characters receive fewer XP.) 
Chapter 3, "Creating Adventures, " provides 
guidelines for designing combat encounters using 
experience points. 
ABSENT CHARACTERS 
Typically, adventurers earn experience only for 
encounters they·participate in. If a player is absent 
for a session, the player's character misses out on the 
experience points. 
Over time, you might end up with a level gap between 
the characters of players who never miss a session and 
characters belonging to players who are more sporadic 
in their attendance. Nothing is wrong with that. A gap 
of two or three levels between different characters in 
the same party isn't going to ruin the game for anyone. 
Some DMs treat XP as a reward for participating in 
the game, and keeping up with the rest of the party is 
good incentive for players to attend as many sessions 
as possible. 
As an alternative , give absent characters the same 
XP that the other characters earned each session, 
keeping the group at the same level. Few players 
will intentionally miss out on the fun of gaming just 
because they know they'll receive XP for it even if they 
don't show up. 
NONCOMBAT CHALLE .. GES ------:-
You decide whether to award experience to characters 
for overcoming challenges out ide combat. If the 
adventurers complete a ten e negotiatio n with a baron, 
forge a trade agreement with a clan of surly dwarves, 
or successfully navigate the Chasm of Doom, you might 
decide that they deserve an XP reward. 
As a starting point, use the rules for building combat 
encounters in chapter 3 to gauge the difficulty of the 
challenge . Then award the characters XP as if it had 
been a combat encounter of the same difficulty, but only 
if the encounter involved a meaningful risk of failure. 
MILESTONES 
You can also award XP when characters complete 
significant milestones. When preparing your adventure, 
designate certain events or challenges as milestones, as 
with the following examples: 
Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to 
complete the adventure. 
Discovering a hidden location or piece of information 
relevant to the adventure. 
Reaching an important destination. 
When awarding XP, treat a major mileston e as a hard 
encounter and a minor mileston e as an easy encounter. 
If you want to reward your players for their progress 
through an adventure with something more than XP 
and treasure, give them additional small rewards at 
milestone points. Here are some examples: 
The adventurers gain the benefit of a short rest. 
Characters can recover a Hit Die or a low-level 
spell slot. 
Characters can regain the use of magic items that 
have had their limited uses expended. 
LEVEL ADVANCEMENT WITHOUT XP 
You can do away with experience points entirely and 
control the rate of character advancement. Advance 
characters based on how many sessions they play, or 
when they accomplish significant story goals in the 
campaign. In either case, you tell the players when their 
characters gain a level. 
This method of level advancement can be particularly 
helpful if your campaign doesn't include much 
combat, or includes so much combat that tracking XP 
becomes tiresome. 
SESSION- BASED ADVANCEMENT 
A good rate of session-based advancement is to have 
characters reach 2nd level after the first session of play, 
3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two 
more sessions. Then spend two or three sessions for 
each subsequent level. This rate mirrors the standard 
rate of advancement , assuming sessions are about four 
hours long. 
STORY- BASED ADVANCEMENT 
When you let the story of the campaign drive 
advancement, you award levels when adventurers 
accomplish significant goals in the campaign. 
CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME 26! 

CHAPTER 9: DuNGEON MASTER's WoRKSHOP 
S THE DUNGEON MASTER, YOU AREN'T LIMITED 
by the rules in the Player's Handboo k, the 
guidelines in this book, or the selection of 
monsters in the Monster Manual. You can 
let your imaginati on run wild. This chapter 
contains optional rules that you can use to 
customize your campaign, as well as guidelines on 
creating your own material, such as monsters and 
magic items. 
The options in this chapter relate to many different 
parts of the game. Some of them are variants of 
rules, and others are entirely new rules. Each option 
represents a different genre, style of play, or both. 
Consider trying no more than one or two of the options 
at a time so that you can clearly assess their effects on 
your campaign before adding other options. 
Before you add a new rule to your campaign, ask 
yourself two questions: 
• Will the rule improve the game? 
• Will my players like it? 
If you're confident that the answer to both questions is 
yes, then you have nothing to lose by giving it a try. Urge 
your players to provide feedback. If the rule or game 
element isn't functioning as intended or isn't adding 
much to your game, you can refine it or ditch it. No 
matter what a rule's source, a rule serves you, not the 
other way around. 
Beware of adding anything to your game that allows 
a character to concentrate on more than one effect at 
a time, use more than one reaction or bonus action 
per round, or attune to more than three magic items 
at a time. Rules and game elements that override the 
rules for concentration, reactions, bonus actions, and 
magic item attunement can seriously unbalance or 
overcomplicate your game. 
ABILITY OPTIONS 
The optional rules in this section pertain to using 
ability scores. 
PROFICIENCY DICE ------------------This optional rule replaces a character's proficiency 
bonus with a proficiency die, adding more randomness 
to the game and making proficiency a less reliable 
indicator of mastery. Instead of adding a proficiency 
bonus to an ability check, an attack roll, or saving throw, 
the character's player rolls a die. The Proficiency Die 
table shows which die or dice to roll, as determined by 
the character's level. 
Whenever a feature, such as the rogue's Expertise, 
lets a character double his or her proficiency bonus, 
the player rolls the character's proficiency die twice 
instead of once. 
This option is intended for player characte rs and 
non player characters who have levels, as opposed to 
monsters who don't. PROFICIENCY DIE 
Level Proficiency Bonus Proficiency Die 
1st-4th +2 1d4 
5th-8th +3 1d6 
9th-12th +4 1d8 
13th-16th +5 1d10 
17th-20th +6 1d12 
SKILL VARIANTS 
A skill dictates the circumstances under which a 
character can add his or her proficiency bonus to an 
ability check. Skills define those circumstances by 
referring to different aspects of the six ability scores. 
For example, Acrobatics and Stealth are two different 
aspects of Dexterity, and a character can specialize in 
either or both. 
You can dispense with skills and use one of the 
following variants. Choose whichever one best suits 
your campaign. 
ABILITY CHECK PROFICIENCY 
With this variant rule, characters don't have skill 
proficiencies. Instead, each character has proficiency 
in two abilities: one tied to the character 's class and 
one tied to the character's background. The Ability 
Proficiencies by Class table suggests a proficiency for 
each class, and you choose which ability is tied to a 
given background. Starting at 1st level, a character adds 
his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check tied to 
one or the other of these two abilities. 
ABILITY CHECK PROFICIENCIES BY CLASS 
Class Ability Check 
Barbarian Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom 
Bard Any one 
Cleric Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 
Druid Intelligence or Wisdom 
Fighter Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom 
Monk Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence 
Paladin Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma 
Ranger 
Rogue 
Sorcerer 
Warlock 
Wizard Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom 
Dexterity, Intelligence , Wisdom, or Charisma 
Intelligence or Charisma 
Intelligence or Charisma 
Intelligence or Wisdom 
The Expertise feature works differently than normal 
under this rule. At 1st level, instead of choosing two 
skill proficiencies, a character with the Expertise class 
feature chooses one of the abilities in which he or she 
has proficiency. Selecting an ability counts as two 
of the character's Expertise choices. If the character 
would gain an additional skill proficiency , that character 
instead selects another ability check in which to gain 
proficiency. 
H PTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
This option removes skills from the game and 
doesn't allow for much distinction among characters . 
For example , a character can't choose to emphasize 
persuasion or intimidation; he or she is equally 
adept at both. 
BACKGROUND PROFICIENCY 
With this variant rule, characters don't have skill or tool 
proficiencies. Anything that would grant the character 
a skill or tool proficiency provides no benefit. Instead, 
a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any 
ability check to which the character's prior training and 
experience (reflected in the character's background) 
reasonably applies. The DM is the ultimate judge of 
whether the character 's background applies. 
For example , the player of a character with the noble 
background could reasonably argue that the proficiency 
bonus should apply to a Charisma check the character 
makes to secure an audience with the king. The player 
should be encouraged to explain in specific terms how 
the character's background applies. Not simply "I'm 
a noble," but "I spent three years before starting my 
adventuring career serving as my family's ambassador 
to the court, and this sort of thing is second nature 
to me now." 
This simple system relies heavily on players 
developing their characters ' histories. Don't let it 
result in endless debates about whether a character 's 
proficiency bonus applies in a given situation. Unless 
a player's attempt to explain the relevance of the 
character's background makes everyone else at the table 
roll their eyes at its absurdity, go ahead and reward the 
player for making the effort. 
If a character has the Expertise feature, instead 
of choosing skills and tools to gain the benefit of 
that feature, the player defines aspects of his or her 
background to which the benefit applies. Continuing 
the noble example, the player might decide to apply 
Expertise to "situations where courtly manners and 
etiquette are paramount " and "figuring out the secret 
plots that court members hatch against one another." 
PERSONALITY TRAIT PROFICIENCY 
With this variant rule, characters don't have skill 
proficiencies. Instead, a character can add his or her 
proficiency bonus to any ability check directly related to 
the character's positive personality traits. For example , 
a character with a positive personality trait of "I never 
have a plan, but I'm great at making things up as I go 
along" might apply the bonus when engaging in some 
off-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight spot. A player 
should come up with at least four positive personalit)l 
traits when creating a character. 
When a character 's negative personality trait directly 
impacts an ability check, the character has disadvantage 
on the check. For example , a hermit whose negative 
trait is "I often get lost in my own thoughts and 
contemplation , oblivious to my surroundings" might 
have disadvantage on an ability check made to notice 
creatures sneaking up. 
If a character has the Expertise feature, the player can 
apply its benefit to personality traits related to ability 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP checks, instead of to skills or tools. If a character would 
gain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead 
gains a new positive personality trait. 
This system relies heavily on players developing 
their characters ' personalities . Make sure that different 
characters ' traits-positive and negative-come into play 
with about the same frequency. Don't let a player get 
away with a positive trait that always seems to apply and 
a negative trait that never does. 
At your discretion, you can also tie a character 's 
ideals, bonds, and flaws to this system. 
HERO POINTS 
Hero points work well in epic fantasy and mythic 
campaigns in which the characters are meant to be 
more like superheroes than the average adventurer is. 
With this option, a character starts with 5 hero point 
at 1st level. Each time the character gains a level, he or 
she loses any unspent hero points and gains a new total 
equal to 5 +half the character's level. 
A player can spend a hero point whenever he or she 
makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw 
The player can spend the hero point after the roll is 
made but before any of its results are applied. Spend in_ 
the hero point allows the player to roll a d6 and add it 
to the d20, possibly turning a failure into a success. A 
player can spend only 1 hero point per roll. 
In addition, whenever a character fails a death saving 
throw, the player can spend one hero point to turn the 
failure into a success. 
NEW ABILITY SCORES: 
HONOR AND SANITY 
If you're running a campaign shaped by a strict code of 
honor or the constant risk of insanity, consider adding 
one or both these new ability scores: Honor and Sani _ 
These abilities function like the standard six abilities. 
with exceptions specified in each ability below. 
Here's how to incorporate these optional abilities at 
character creation: 
If your players use the standard array of ability 
scores, add one 11 to the array for each optional 
ability you add. 
If your players use the optional point-buy system, add 
3 points to the number of points for each optional 
ability you add. 
If your players roll their ability scores, have them roll 
for the added ability scores. 
If you ever need to make a check or saving throw for 
Honor or Sanity for a monster that lacks the score, you 
can use Charisma for Honor and Wisdom for Sanity. 
HoNOR ScoRE 
If your campaign involves cultures where a rigid code 
of honor is part of daily life, consider using the Honor 
score as a means of measuring a character 's devotion 
to that code. This ability fits well in a setting inspired 
by Asian cultures, such as Kara-Tur in the Forgotten 
Realms. The Honor ability is also useful in any 
campaign that revolves around orders of knights. 
Honor measures not only a character's devotion to a 
code but also the character's understanding of it. The 
Honor score can also reflect how others perceive a 
character's honor. A character with a high Honor usually 
has a reputation that others know about, especially 
those who have high Honor scores themselves. 
Unlike other abilities, Honor can't be raised with 
normal ability score increases . Instead, you can award 
increases to Honor-or impose reductions-based on 
a character's actions. At the end of an adventure, if you 
think a character 's actions in the adventure reflected 
well or poorly on his or her understanding of the code, 
you can increase or decrease the character's Honor by 
1. As with other ability scores, a character 's Honor can't 
exceed 20 or fall below 1. 
Honor Checks. Honor checks can be used in social 
situations, much as Charisma would, when a character's 
understanding of a code of conduct is the most defining 
factor in the way a social intera ction will play out. 
You might also call for an Honor check when a 
character is in one of the following situations: 
Being unsure how to act with honor 
• Surrendering while trying to save face 
Trying to determine another character's Honor score 
Trying to use the proper etiquette in a delicate 
social situation 
Using his or her honorabl e or dishonorable reputation 
to influence someone else 
Honor Saving Throws. An Honor saving throw 
comes into play when you want to determin e whether 
a character might inadvertently do something 
dishonorabl e. You might call for an Honor saving throw 
in the following situations: 
Avoiding an accidental breach of honor or etiquette 
Resisting the urge to respond to goading or insults 
from an enemy 
Recognizing when an enemy attempts to trick a 
character into a breach of honor 
SANITY ScoRE 
Consider using the Sanity score if your campaign 
revolves around entities of an utterly alien and 
unspeakabl e nature, such as Great Cthulhu, whose 
powers and minions can shatter a character's mind. 
A character with a high Sanity is level-headed even in 
the face of insane circumstances , while a character with 
low Sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted 
by eldritch horrors that are beyond normal reason. 
Sanity Checks. You might ask characters to make a 
Sanity check in place of an Intelligence check to recall 
lore about the alien creatures of madness featured 
in your campaign, to decipher the writings of raving 
lunatics, or to learn spells from tomes of forbidden lore. 
You might also call for a Sanity check when a character 
tries one of the following activities: 
Deciphering a piece of text written in a language so 
alien that it threatens to break a character's mind 
Overcoming the lingering effects of madness 
• Comprehending a piece of alien magic foreign to all 
normal understanding of magic Sanity Saving Throws. You might call for a Sanity 
saving throw when a character runs the risk of 
succumbing to madness , such as in the following 
situations: 
Seeing a creature from the Far Realm or other alien 
realms for the first time 
• Making direct contact with the mind of an 
alien creature 
Being subjected to spells that affect mental stability, 
such as the insanity option of the symbol spell 
Passing through a demiplane built on alien physics 
Resisting an effect conferred by an attack or spell that 
deals psychic damage 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP A failed Sanity save might result in short-term , long­
term, or indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, 
"Running the Game." Any time a character suffers from 
long-term or indefinite madness, the character 's Sanity 
is reduced by 1. A greater restoration spell can restore 
Sanity lost in this way, and a character can increase his 
or her Sanity through level advancement . 
ADVENTURING OPTIONS 
This section provides options for changing how rests 
work, as well as for adding unusual things to your 
campaign , such as modern weapons . 
FEAR AND HORROR 
The rules for fear and horror can help you sustain an 
atmospher e of dread in a dark fantasy campaign. 
FEAR 
When adventurers confront threats they have no 
hope of overcoming, you can call for them to make a 
Wisdom saving throw. Set the DC according to the 
circumstan ces. A character who fails the save becomes 
frightened for 1 minute. The character can repeat the 
saving throw at the end of each of his or her turns, 
ending the effect on the character on a successful save. 
HORROR 
Horror involves more than simple fright. It entails 
revulsion and anguish. Often it arises when adventurer 
see something completely contrary to the common 
understanding of what can and should occur in the 
world, or upon the realization of a dreadful truth. 
In such a situation , you can call on characters to make 
a Charisma saving throw to resist the horror. Set the DC 
based on the magnitude of the horrific circumstanc es. 
On a failed save, a character gains a short-term or long­
term form of madness that you choose or determine 
randomly, as detailed in chapter 8, "Running the Game.-
HEALING 
These optional rules make it easier or harder for 
adventurers to recover from injury, either increasing 
or reducing the amount of time your players can spend 
adventuring before rest is required. 
HEALER'S KIT DEPENDENCY 
A character can't spend any Hit Dice after finishing a 
short rest until someone expends one use of a healer's 
kit to bandage and treat the character's wounds. 
HEALING SuRGES 
This optional rule allows characters to heal up in 
the thick of combat and works well for parties that 
feature few or no characters with healing magic, or for 
campaigns in which magical healing is rare. 
As an action, a character can use a healing surge and 
spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die 
spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the 
character 's Constitu tion modifier. The character regains 
hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to 
spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. 
A character who uses a healing surge can't do so 
again until he or she finishes a short or long rest. 
Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent 
Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, 
a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her level 
divided by four (minimum of one die). 
For a more superheroic feel, you can let a character 
use a healing surge as a bonus action, rather than as 
an action. 
SLOW NATURAL HEALING 
Characters don't regain hit points at the end of a long 
rest. Instead, a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at 
the end of a long rest, just as with a short rest. 
This optional rule prolongs the amount of time that 
characters need to recover from their wounds without 
the benefits of magical healing and works well for 
grittier, more realistic campaigns. 
REST VARIANTS 
The rules for short and long rests presented in chapter 
8 of the Player's Handbook work well for a heroic-style 
campaign. Characters can go toe-to-toe with deadly foes, 
take damage to within an inch of their lives, yet still be 
ready to fight again the next day. If this approach doesn't 
fit your campaign, consider the following variants. 
EPIC HEROISM 
This variant uses a short rest of 5 minutes and a long 
rest of 1 hour. This change makes combat more routine, 
since characters can easily recover from every battle. 
You might want to make combat encounters more 
difficult to compensate. 
Spellcasters using this system can afford to burn 
through spell slots quickly, especially at higher levels. 
Consider allowing spellcasters to restore expended 
spell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots 
(rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to limit 
spell slots restored to 5th level or lower. Only a full 
8-hour rest will allow a spellcast er to restore all spell 
slots and to regain spell slots of 6th level or higher. 
GRITTY REALISM 
This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long 
rest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on the campaign, 
requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits 
and drawbacks of combat. Characters can't afford to 
engage in too many battles in a row. and all adventuring 
requires careful planning. 
This approach encourages the characters to 
spend time out of the dungeon. It" a good option for 
campaigns that emphasize intrigue. politics. and 
interactions among other PCs. and in which combat is 
rare or something to be avoided rather rhan rushed into. 
FIREARMS 
If you want to model the swa hbuckling r.yle of 
The Three Musketeers and imilar tale . you can 
introduce gunpowder weapon ro your campaign that 
are associated with the Renaissance. imilarly. in a 
campaign where a space hip h era bed or elements 
of modern-day Earth are pre en . fu uri tic or modern firearms might appear. The Firearms table provides 
examples of firearms from all three of those periods. 
The modern and futuristic items are priceless. 
PROFICIENCY 
It's up to you to decide whether a character has 
proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&D 
worlds wouldn't have such proficiency. During their 
downtim e, characters can use the training rules in the 
Player's Handbook to acquire proficiency, assuming 
that they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons 
working while mastering their use. 
PROPERTIES 
Firearms use special ammuni tion, and some of them 
have the burst fire or reload property. 
Ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is 
destroyed upon use. Renaissance and modern firearms 
use bullets. Futuristic firearms are powered by a 
special type of ammunition called energy cells. An 
energy cell contains enough power for all the shots its 
firearm can make. 
Burst Fire. A weapon that has the burst fire property 
can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 
10-foot-cube area within normal range with shots. Each 
creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or take the weapon's normal damage. This 
action uses ten pieces of ammunition. 
Reload. A limited number of shots can be made with 
a weapon that has the reload property . A character must 
then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the 
character's choice). 
EXPLOSIVES 
A campaign might include explosives from the 
Renaissance or the modern world (the latter are 
priceless), as presented in the Explosives table. 
BOMB 
As an action, a character can light this bomb and throw 
it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 
feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity 
saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage. 
GUNPOWDER 
Gunpowder is chiefly used to propel a bu 11et out of the 
barrel of a pistol or rifle, or it is formed into a bomb. 
Gunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs and in water­
resistant powder horns. 
Setting fire to a container full of gunpowder can cause 
it to explode, dealing fire damage to creatures within 
10 feet of it (3d6 for a powder horn, 7d6 for a keg). A 
successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the 
damage. Setting fire to an ounce of gunpowder causes 
it to flare for 1 round, shedding bright light in a 30-foot 
radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. 
DYNAMITE 
As an action, a creature can light a stick of dynamite 
and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature 
within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity 
saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
A character can bind sticks of dynamite together so 
they explode at the same time. Each additional stick 
increases the damage by 1d6 (to a maximum of 10d6) 
and the burst radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet). ALIEN TECHNOLOGY 
When adventurers find a piece of technology that isn't 
from their world or time period, the players might 
understand what the object is, but the characters 
rarely will. To simulate a character's ignorance about 
the technology, have the character make a series of 
Intelligence checks to figure it out. Dynamit e can be rigged with a longer fuse to explode 
after a set amount of time, usually 1 to 6 rounds. Roll 
initiative for the dynamite . After the set number of 
rounds goes by, the dynamite explodes on that initiative . 
To determine how the technology works, a character 
must succeed on a number of Intelligence checks 
based on the complexity of the item: two successes for 
a simple item (such as a cigarette lighter, calculator, or 
revolver) and four successes for a complex item (such a 
a computer, chainsaw, or hovercraft). Then consult the 
Figuring Out Alien Technology table. Consider making 
the item break if a characte r fails four or more times 
before taking a long rest. GRENADES 
As an action, a character can throw a grenade at a 
point up to 60 feet away. With a grenade launcher, the 
character can propel the grenade up to 120 feet away. 
Each creature within 20 feet of an exploding 
fragmentation grenade must make a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw, taking 5d6 piercing damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successfu l one. 
One round after a smoke grenade lands, it emits a 
cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area in 
a 20-foot radius. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per 
hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind 
(20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.

PLOT POINTS 
Plot points allow players to change the course of the 
campaign, introduce plot complications, alter the 
world, and even assume the role of the DM. If your first 
reaction to reading this optional rule is to worry that 
your players might abuse it, it's probably not for you. 
USING PLOT POINTS 
Each player starts with 1 plot point. During a session, 
a player can spend that point for one effect. The effect 
depends on your group's approach to this optional rule. 
Three options are presented below. 
A player can spend no more than 1 plot point 
per session. You can increase this limit if you like, 
especially if you want the players to drive more of the 
story. Once every player at the table has spent a plot 
point, they each gain 1 plot point. 
OPTION 1: WHAT A TWIST! 
A player who spends a plot point gets to add some 
element to the setting or situation that the group 
(including you) must accept as true. For example, a 
player can spend a plot point and state that his or her 
character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or 
a monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed 
into a horrid beast. 
A player who wants to spend a plot point in this way 
should take a minute to discuss his or her idea with 
everyone else at the table and get feedback before 
settling on a plot development. 
OPTION 2: THE PLOT THICKENS 
Whenever a player spends a plot point, the player to his 
or her right must add a complication to the scene. For 
example, if the player who spends the plot point decides 
that her character has found a secret door, the player 
to the right might state that opening the door triggers a 
magical trap that teleports the party to another part of 
the dungeon. 
OPTION 3: THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY 
With this approach, there is no permanent DM. 
Everyone makes a character, and one person starts as 
the DM and runs the game as normal. That person's 
character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the 
group or remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes. 
At any time, a player can spend a plot point to become 
the DM. That player's character becomes an NPC, and 
play continues. It's probably not a good idea to swap 
roles in the middle of combat, but it can happen if your 
group allows time for the new DM to settle into his or 
her role and pick up where the previous DM left off. 
Using plot points in this way can make for an 
exciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in 
unexpected directions. This approach is also a great 
way for would-be DMs to try running a game in small, 
controlled doses. 
In a campaign that uses plot points this way, everyone 
should come to the table with a bit of material prepared 
or specific encounters in mind. A player who isn't 
prepared or who doesn't feel like DMing can choose 
to not spend a plot point that session. 
For this approach to work, it's a good idea to establish 
some shared assumptions about the campaign so that 
DMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each 
other's plans. 
COMBAT OPTIONS 
The options in this section provide alternative ways to 
handle combat. The main risk of adding some of these 
rules is slowing down play. 
INITIATIVE VARIANTS ----
This section offers different ways to handle initiative. 
INITIATIVE ScoRE 
• With this optional rule, creature don't roll initiative 
at the start of combat. Instead, each creature has an 
initiative score, which is a passive Dexterity check: 
10 +Dexterity modifier. 
By cutting down on die rolls, math done on the fly, 
and the process of asking for and recording totals, you 
can speed your game up considerably-at the cost of an 
initiative order that is often predictable . 
SIDE INITIATIVE 
Recording initiative for each PC and monster, arrangin 
everyone in the correct order, and remembering where 
you are in the list can bog the game down. If you want 
quicker combats, at the risk of those combats becomin g 
unbalanced, try using the side initiative rule. 
Under this variant, the players roll a d20 for their 
initiative as a group, or side. You also roll a d20. Neither 
roll receives any modifiers. Whoever rolls highest wins 
initiative . In case of a tie, keep rerolling until the tie 
is broken. 
When it's a side's turn, the members of that side can 
act in any order they choose. Once everyone on the side 
has taken a turn, the other side goes. A round ends 
when both sides have completed their turns. 
If more than two sides take part in a battle, each side 
rolls for initiative. Sides act from the highest roll to 
lowest. Combat continues in the initiative order until the 
battle is complete. 
This variant encourages teamwork and makes your 
life as a DM easier, since you can more easily coordinate 
monsters. On the downside, the side that wins initiative 
can gang up on enemies and take them out before they 
have a chance to act. 
SPEED FACTOR 
Some DMs find the regular progression of initiative 
too predictable and prone to abuse. Players can use 
their knowledge of the initiative order to influence their 
decisions. For example , a badly wounded fighter might 
charge a troll because he knows that the cleric goes 
before the monster and can heal him. 
Speed factor is an option for initiative that introduces 
more uncertainty into combat, at the cost of speed of 
play. Under this variant, the participants in a battle roll 
initiative each round. Before rolling, each character or 
monster must choose an action. 
Initiative Modifiers. Modifiers might apply to a 
-eature's initiative dependin g on its size and the action 
-rakes. For example, a creature that fights with a light 
eapon or casts a simple spell is more likely to act 
fore a creature armed with a heavy or slow weapon. 
:ee the Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers table for 
: rails. If an action has no modifier listed, the action has 
-effect on initiative. If more than one modifier applies 
such as wielding a two-handed , heavy melee weapon), 
.ipply them all to the initiative roll.

Don't apply the same modifier more than once on a 
creature's turn. For example, a rogue fighting with two 
daggers gains the +2 bonus for using a light or finesse 
weapon only once. In the case of spellcasting , apply only 
the modifier from the highest-lev el spell. 
Apply any modifiers for bonus actions to that 
creature's turn, remembering never to apply the 
same modifier twice. For instance, a paladin casts a 
2nd-level spell as a bonus action and then attacks with a 
-hortsword. The paladin takes a -2 penalty for the spell 
and gains a +2 bonus for using a light weapon, for a total 
modifier of +0. 
The table is only a starting point. You can refer to it 
when adjudicating any actions a character takes that 
you think should be faster or slower. Quick, easy actions 
hould grant a bonus, while slow, difficult ones should 
incur a penalty. As a rule of thumb, apply a bonus or 
penalty of 2 or 5 for an action. 
For example, a fighter wants to turn a winch to raise a 
portcullis. This is a complex, difficult action. You could 
rule that it incurs a -5 initiative penalty. 
Rolling Initiative. After deciding on an action, 
everyone rolls initiative and applies modifiers , keeping 
rhe result secret. You then announce an initiative 
number, starting with 30 and working down (it helps to 
call out ranges of numbers at the start). Break any ties 
by having the combatant with the highest Dexterity act 
first. Otherwise, roll to determin e who goes first. 
Turns. On its turn, a creature moves as normal but 
must take the action it selected or take no action at all. 
Once everyone has acted, the process repeats. 
Everyone in the battle selects an action. rolls initiative, 
and takes turns in order. ACTION OPTIO NS 
This section provides new action options for combat. 
They can be added as a group or individually to 
your game. 
CLIMB ONTO A BIGGER CREATURE 
If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it 
can do so by grappling. A Small or Medium creature has 
little chance of making a successful grapple against a 
Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic 
has granted the grappler supernatural might. 
As an alternativ e, a suitably large opponent can be 
treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its 
back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability 
checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger 
creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make 
a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check 
contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobati cs) check. 
If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully 
moves into the target creature's space and clings to its 
body. While in the target's space, the smaller creature 
moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls 
against it. 
The smaller creature can move around within the 
larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult 
terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the 
smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's 
location, and is left to your discretion . The larger 
creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an 
action-knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, 
or grabbing and throwing it-by making a Strength 
(Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's 
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. 
The smaller creature chooses which ability to use. 
DISARM 
A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon 
or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker 
makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength 
(Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the 
attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage 
or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item. 
The attacker has disadvantag e on its attack roll if 
the target is holding the item with two or more hands. 
The target has advantage on its ability check if it is 
larger than the attacking creature, or disadvant age if it 
is smaller. 
MARK 
This option makes it easier for melee combatants to 
harry each other with opportunity attacks. 
When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also 
mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, 
any opportunity attack it makes against the marked 
target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't 
expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't 
make the attack if anything, such as the incapacitated 
condition or the shocking grasp spell, is preventing it 
from taking reactions . The attacker is limited to one 
opportunit y attack per turn. 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
OVERRUN 
When a creature tries to move through a hostile 
creature's space, the mover can try to force its way 
through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an 
action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength 
(Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's 
Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the 
overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than 
the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If 
the mover wins the contest, it can move through the 
hostile creature's space once this turn. 
SHOVE ASIDE 
With this option, a creature uses the special shove 
attack from the Player's Handbook to force a target 
to the side, rather than away. The attacker has 
disadvantage on its Strength (Athletics) check when it 
does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves 
the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach. 
TUMBLE 
A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's 
space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an 
action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature's 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the tumbler wins the 
contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space 
once this turn. 
HITTING COVER 
When a ranged attack misses a target that has cover, 
you can use this optional rule to determine whether the 
cover was struck by the attack. 
First, determine whether the attack roll would have 
hit the protected target without the cover. If the attack 
roll falls within a range low enough to miss the target 
but high enough to strike the target if there had been 
no cover, the object used for cover is struck. If a creature 
is providing cover for the missed creature and the 
attack roll exceeds the AC of the covering creature, the 
covering creature is hit. 
CLEAVING THROUGH CREATURES 
If your player characters regularly fight hordes of lower­
level monsters, consider using this optional rule to help 
speed up such fights. 
When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature 
to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack 
might carry over to another creature nearby. The 
attacker targets another creature within reach and, if 
the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining 
damage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is 
likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, 
carrying over the remaining damage until there are no 
valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to 
reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points. 
INJURIES ___ _ 
Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. This 
option introduces the potential for long-term injuries. 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP It's up to you to decide when to check for a lingering 
injury. A creature might sustain a lingering injury under 
the following circumstances: 
When it takes a critical hit 
When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright 
When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more 
To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the 
Lingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical 
humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for 
creatures with different body types. 
LINGERING INJURIES 
d20 Injury 
Lose an Eye. You have disadvantage on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks that rely on sight and on 
ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the regenerate 
spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes 
left after sustaining this injury, you're blinded. 
2 Lose an Arm or a Hand. You can no longer hold 
anything with two hands, and you can hold only a 
single object at a time. Magic such as the regenerate 
spell can restore the lost appendage. 
3 Lose a Foot or Leg. Your speed on foot is halved, 
and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless 
you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall 
prone after using the Dash action. You have 
disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. 
Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the 
lost appendage. 
4 Limp. Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You 
must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after 
using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall 
prone. Magical healing removes the limp. 
5-7 Internal Injury. Whenever you attempt an action 
in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action 
and can't use reactions until the start of your next 
turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing 
or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting. 
8-10 Broken Ribs. This has the same effect as Internal 
Injury above, except that the save DC is 10. 
11-13 Horrible Scar. You are disfigured to the extent that 
the wound can't be easily concealed . You have 
disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks 
and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. 
Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal 
and regenerate, removes the scar. 
14-16 Festering Wound. Your hit point maximum is 
reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. 
If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. 
The wound heals if you receive magical healing. 
Alternatively , someone can tend to the wound and 
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 
24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. 
17-20 Minor Scar. The scar doesn't have any adverse 
effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such 
as heal and regenerate, removes the scar. 
Instead of using the effect described in the table, you 
can put the responsibility of representing a character's 
lingering injury in the hands of the player. Roll on the 
Lingering Injuries table as usual, but instead of suffering 
the effect described for that result, that character gains 
a new flaw with the same name. It's up to the player to 
express the lingering injury during play, just like any 
other flaw, with the potential to gain inspiration when 
the injury affects the character in a meaningful way. 
MASSIVE DAMAGE 
This optional rule makes it easier for a creature to be 
felled by massive damage. 
When a creature takes damage from a single source 
equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it 
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw 
or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the 
System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a 
hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution 
save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source. 
SYSTEM SHOCK 
dlO Effect 
The creature drops to 0 hit points. 
2-3 The creature drops to 0 hit points but is stable. 
4-5 The creature is stunned until the end of its next turn. 
6-7 The creature can't take reactions and has 
disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until 
the end of its next turn. 
8-10 The creature can't take reactions until the end of its 
next turn. 
MORALE 
Some combatants might run away when a fight turns 
against them. You can use this optional rule to help 
determine when monsters and NPCs flee. 
A creature might flee under any of the following 
circumstances: 
• The creature is surprised. 
The creature is reduced to half its hit points or fewer 
for the first time in the battle. 
The creature has no way to harm the opposing side 
on its turn. 
A group of creatures might flee under any of the 
following circumstances: 
All the creatures in the group are surprised. 
The group's leader is reduced to 0 hit points, 
incapacitated , taken prisoner, or removed from battle. 
• The group is reduced to half its original size with no 
losses on the opposing side. 
To determine whether a creature or group of 
creatures flees, make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw 
for the creature or the group's leader. If the opposition 
is overwhelming , the saving throw is made with 
disadvantage, or you can decide that the save fails 
automatically. If a group's leader can't make the saving 
throw for whatever reason, have the creature in the 
group with the next highest Charisma score make the 
saving throw instead. On a failed save, the affectedereature or group flees 
by the most expeditious route. If escape is impossibl e, 
the creature or group surrenders. If a creature or group 
that surrenders is attacked by its conquerors, the battle 
might resume, and it's unlikely that further attempts to 
flee or surrender will be made. 
A failed saving throw isn't always to the adventurers' 
benefit. For example, an ogre that flees from combat 
might put the rest of the dungeon on alert or run off with 
treasure that the characters had hoped to plunder. 
CREATING A MONSTER 
The Monster Manual contains hundreds of ready-to-play 
monSters , but it doesn't include every monster that you 
can imagine. Part of the D&D experience is the simple 
joy of creating new monsters and customizing existing 
ones, if for no other reason than to surprise and delight 
your players with something they've never faced before. 
The first step in the process is coming up with the 
concept for your monster. What makes it unique? Where 
does it live? What role do you want it to serve in your 
adventure, your campaign, or your world? What does 
it look like? Does it have any weird abilities? Once you 
have the answers to these questions, you can start 
figuring out how to represent your monster in the game. 
MODIFYING A MONSTER 
Once you have an idea for a monster, you'll need 
statistics to represent it. The first question you should 
ask yourself is: Can I use statistics that already exist? 
A stat block in the Monster Manual might make a 
good starting point for your monster. Imagine, for 
example, that you want to create an intelligent arboreal 
predator that hunts elves. There is no such monster 
in the Monster Manual, but the quaggoth is a savage 
humanoid predator with a climbing speed. You could 
borrow the quaggoth stat block for your new monster, 
changing nothing but the creature's name. You can also 
make minor tweaks, such as replacing the quaggoth's 
language , Undercommon, with one that's more 
appropriate, such as Elvish or Sylvan. 
Need a fiery phoenix? Take the giant eagle or roc, give 
it immunity to fire, and allow it to deal fire damage with 
its attacks. Need a flying monkey? Consider a baboon 
with wings and a flying speed. Almost any monster you 
can imagine can be built using one that already exists. 
Adapting a stat block is far less time-consuming than 
creating one from scratch, and there are changes you 
can make to an existing monster that have no effect 
on its challenge rating, such as swapping languages, 
changing its alignment , or adding special senses. 
However , once you change the creature's offensive or 
defensive ability , such as its hit points or damage, its 
challenge rating might need to change, as shown later. 
SWITCHING WEAPONS 
If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, you can 
replace that weapon with a different one. For example, 
you could replace a hobgoblin 's longsword with a 
halberd. Don't forget to change the damage and the 
attack's reach where appropriate. Also be aware of the 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 273 
consequences of switching from a one-handed weapon want to create something more akin to the monster 
to a two-handed weapon, or vice versa. For example, a stat blocks in the Monster Manual, skip ahead to the 
hobgoblin wielding a halberd (a two-handed weapon) "Creating a Monster Stat Block" section.

274 CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER 'S WORKSHOP 
adjust the challenge rating uggesred by its damage 
output up or down by 1 for e\·ery 2 points of difference. 
If the monster relies more on effects with saving 
throws than on attacks, use the monster's save DC 
instead of its attack bonus. 
If your monster uses different attack bonuses or save 
DCs, use the ones that will come up the most often. 
Average Challenge Rating. The monster's final 
challenge rating is the average of its defensive and 
offensive challenge ratings. Round the average up or 
down to the nearest challenge rating to determine 
your monster's final challenge rating. For example, if 
the creature's defensive challenge rating is 2 and its 
offensive rating is 3, its final rating is 3. 
With the final challenge rating, you can determine the 
monster's proficiency bonus using the Monster Statistics 
by Challenge Rating table. Use the Experience Points 
by Challenge Rating table to determine how much XP 
the monster is worth. A monster of challenge rating 
0 is worth 0 XP if it poses no threat. Otherwise , it is 
worth 10 XP. 
Creating a monster isn't just a number-crunching 
exercise. The guidelines in this chapter can help you 
create monsters, but the only way to know whether a 
monster is fun is to playtest it. After seeing your monster 
in action, you might want to adjust the challenge rating 
up or down based on your experiences.

CREATING A MONSTER STAT BLOCK 
If you want a full monster stat block, use the following 
method to create your new monster. 
The introduction to the Monster Manual explains all 
the components of a monster's stat block. Familiarize 
yourself with that material before you begin. In the 
course of creating your monster, if you find yourself 
unable to make a decision, let the examples in the 
Monster Manual guide you. 
Once you have a monster concept in mind, follow the 
steps below. STEP 1. NAME 
A monster's name should be given as much 
consideration as any other aspect of the monster, 
if not more. 
Your monster might be based on a real-world creature 
or a monster from myth, in which case its name might 
be obvious. If you need to invent a name, keep in 
mind that the best names either reflect the monster's 
appearance or nature (such as the mimic and the 
owlbear) or have a nice ring to them (such as the chuul 
and the thri-kreen). 
STEP 2. SIZE 
Mak6 your monster whatever size you want: Tiny, Small, 
Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. 
A monster's size determines which die is used to 
calculate its hit points in step 8. Size also determines 
how much space the monster occupies , as discussed in 
the Player's Handbook. 
STEP 3. TYPE 
A monster's type provides insight into its origins and 
nature. The Monster Manual describes each monster 
type. Choose the type that best fits your concept for 
the monster. 
STEP 4. ALIGNMENT 
If your monster has no concept of morals, it is 
unaligned. Otherwise , it has an alignment appropriate 
to its nature and moral outlook, as discussed in the 
Player's Handbook. 
STEP 5. ABILITY SCORES AND MODIFIERS 
Monsters , like player characters , have the six ability 
scores. A monster can't have a score lower than 1 or 
higher than 30 in any ability. 
A monster's score in any ability determines its ability 
modifier, as shown in the Ability Scores and Modifiers 
table in the Player's Handbook. 
If you can't decide what a monster's ability scores 
should be, look for comparable monsters in the Monster 
Manual and mimic their ability scores. For example, 
if your monster is roughly as smart as a human 
commoner, give it an Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier) . 
If it's as strong as an ogre, give it a Strength of 19 (+4 
modifier). 
STEP 6. EXPECTED CHALLENGE RATING 
Choose a challenge rating for your monster. See step 
1 under "Creating Quick Monster Stats" for more 
information. You will use the proficiency bonus in later 
steps, so jot it down now or remember it. 
STEP 7. ARMOR CLASS 
A monster's Armor Class has a direct bearing on its 
challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine your 
monster's Armor Class in one of two ways. 
Use the Table. You can choose an appropriate AC 
based on the monster's expected challenge rating, as 
shown in the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating 
table. The table provides the baseline AC for a monster 
of a specific challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the 
AC as you see fit. For example, the baseline AC for a 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
~75 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP challenge rating 1 monster is 13, but if your monster is 
well armored , raise its AC accordingly. Don't worry if 
the monster's AC isn't matching up with the expected 
challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affec· 
a monster's challenge rating, as shown in later steps. 
Determine an Appropriate AC. Alternatively, you car: 
determine an appropriate AC based on the type of arm -
the monster wears, its natural armor, or some other 
Armor Class booster (such as the mage armor spell). 
Again, don't worry if the monster's AC isn't matching u 
with the expected challenge rating for the monster. 
If your monster wears manufactured armor, its 
Armor Class is based on the type of armor worn (see 
the Player's Handbook for armor types). If the monster 
carries a shield, apply the shield bonus to its AC 
as normal. 
A monster that doesn't wear armor might have natur2 
armor, in which case it has an AC equal to 10 +its 
Dexterity modifier+ its natural armor bonus. A mons£ 
with a thick hide generally has a natural armor bonu 
of +1 to +3. The bonus can be higher if the creature 
is exceptionally well armored. A gorgon, for example. 
is covered in steely plates and has a natural armor 
bonus of+9. 
STEP 8. HIT POINTS 
A monster's hit points have a direct bearing on its 
challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine y -
monster's hit points in one of two ways. 
Use the Table. You can start with the monster's 
expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an 
appropriate number of hit points. The table presents a 
range of hit points for each challenge rating. 
Assign Hit Dice. Alternatively, you can assign a 
number of Hit Dice to a monster, then calculate its 
average hit points. Don't worry if the hit points aren t 
matching up with the expected challenge rating for the 
monster. Other factors can affect a monster's challenge 
rating, as shown in later steps, and you can always 
adjust a monster's Hit Dice and hit points later on. 
A monster can have as many Hit Dice as you want. 
but the size of the die used to calculate its hit points 
depends on the monster's size, as shown in the Hit Di 
by Size table. For example, a Medium monster uses d~: 
for hit points, so a Medium monster with 5 Hit Dice ru::­
a Constitution of 13 (+1 modifier) has 5d8 +5 hit poin-" 
A monster typically has average hit points based on·-~ 
Hit Dice. For example , a creature with 5d8 + 5 hit poi 
has an average of 27 hit points (5 x 4.5 + 5). 
HIT DICE BY SIZE 
Monster Size Hit Die Average HP per Die 
Tiny d4 21/2 
Small d6 31/2 
Medium d8 41/2 
Large dlO 5112 
Huge dl2 61/2 
Gargantuan d20 101/2 
STEP 9. DAMAGE VuL "ER..'\BILITIES, 
RESISTANCES, AND hnn;. "ITIE 
Decide whether your mon ter ha \·ulnerability, 
resistance , or immunity to one or more types of 
damage (see the Players Handbook for descriptions 
of the various damage types).. ign a vulnerability, 
resistance, or immunity to a mon ter only when it's 
intuitive. For example, it make en e for a monster 
made of molten lava to have immunity to fire damage. 
Giving a monster resistances and immunities to three 
or more damage types (especially bludgeoning, piercing, 
and slashing damage) is like gi\·ing it extra hit points. 
However, adventurer s have more resources at higher 
levels to counteract such defense . making resistances 
and immunities less relevant at higher levels. 
Effective Hit Points. If a monster has resistance 
or immunity to several damage types-especially 
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from 
nonmagical weapons-and not all the characters in the 
party possess the means to counteract that resistance 
or immunity , you need to take these defenses into 
account when comparing your monster's hit points to its 
expected challenge rating. Using the Effective Hit Points 
Based on Resistances and Immunities table, apply 
the appropriate multiplier to the monster's hit points 
to determine its effective hit points for the purpose of 
gauging its final challenge rating. (The monster's actual 
hit points shouldn't change.) 
For example, a monster with an expected 
challenge rating of 6, 150 hit points, and resistance 
to bludgeoning , piercing, and slashing damage from 
nonmagical weapons effectively has 225 hit points 
(using the 1.5 multiplier for resistances) for the purpose 
of gauging its final challenge rating. 
Monsters don't normally have vulnerability to more 
than one or two types of damage. Vulnerabilities don't 
significant ly affect a monster's challenge rating, unless 
a monster has vulnerabilities to multiple damage types 
that are prevalent, especially bludgeoning , piercing, 
and slashing. For such a strange monster, reduce its 
effective hit points by half. Or even better, eliminate 
the vulnerabilities and give the brittle monster fewer 
hit points. 
EFFECTIVE HIT POINTS BASED ON 
RESISTANCES AND IMMUNITIES 
Expected HP Multiplier for HP Multiplier for 
Challenge Rating Resistances Immunities 
1-4 x2 x2 
5-10 X 1.5 x2 
11-16 X 1.25 X 1.5 
17 or more X 1 X 1.25 
STEP 10. ATTACK BONUSES 
A monster's attack bonuses have a direct bearing on its 
challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine a 
monster's attack bonuses in one of two ways. 
Use the Table. You can start with the monster's 
expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an 
appropriate attack bonus for all the monster's attacks, 
regardless of its ability scores. The table provides the baseline attack bonus for each 
challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the attack bonus as 
you see fit to match whatever concept you have in mind. 
For example, the baseline attack bonus for a challenge 
rating 1 monster is +3, but if your monster needs more 
accuracy, raise its bonus accordingly. Don't worry if 
the monster's attack bonus isn't matching up with the 
expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors 
can affect a monster's challenge rating, as shown in 
later steps. 
Calculate Attack Bonuses. Alternatively, you can 
calculate a monster's attack bonuses the same way 
players calculate the attack bonuses of a character. 
Wpen a monster has an action that requires an attack 
roll, its attack bonus is equal to its proficiency bonus+ 
its Strength or Dexterity modifier. A monster usually 
applies its Strength modifier to melee attacks and its 
Dexterity modifier to ranged attacks, although smaller 
monsters sometimes use Dexterity for both. 
Again, don't worry if the attack bonuses aren't 
matching up with the expected challenge rating for 
the monster. You can always adjust a monster's attack 
bonuses later. 
STEP 11. DAMAGE 
A monster's damage output-the amount of damage it 
deals every round-has a direct bearing on its challenge 
rating, and vice versa. You can determine a monster's 
damage output in one of two ways. 
Use the Table. You can start with the monster's 
expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine how 
much damage the monster should deal every round. 
The table presents a range at each challenge rating. 
It doesn't matter how this damage is apportioned or 
distributed ; for example, a monster might deal the 
damage every round with a single attack, or the damage 
could be split among multiple attacks against one or 
more foes. 
Choose the type of damage based on how you imagine 
the damage being delivered. For example, if the monster 
is attacking with razor-sharp claws, the damage it deals 
is probably slashing damage. If its claws are poisonous, 
some portion of the damage might be poison damage 
instead of slashing damage. 
If you want the damage output to vary slightly from 
round to round, you can translate the damage range into 
a single die expression (for a monster with one attack) 
or multiple die expressions (for a monster with multiple 
attacks). For example, a challenge rating 2 monster 
deals 15-20 damage per round. If you imagine the 
creature having a Strength of 18 (+4 modifier), you could 
give it one melee attack that deals 3d8 + 4 (average 
17.5) damage, split the damage output into two separate 
attacks that deal1d10 + 4 (average 9) damage each; or 
use any other combination where the average damage 
output falls within the desired range. 
Base the Damage on the Weapon. Alternatively , 
you can use a die expression to represent the damage 
that a monster deals with each of its attacks based on 
whatever weapon it is using. 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHO P 
I, Don't worry if the damage output isn't matching up 
with the expected challenge rating for the monster. 
Other factors can affect a monster's challenge rating, 
as will be discussed in later steps, and you can always 
adjust a monster's damage output later on. 
Some monsters use natural weapons , such as claws 
or tail spikes. Others wield manufactured weapons. 
If a monster has natural weapons, you decide how 
much damage it deals with those attacks, as well as the 
type of damage. See the Monster Manual for examples. 
If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, it deals 
damage appropriate to the weapon. For example, a 
greataxe in the hands of a Medium monster deals ld12 
slashing damage plus the monster's Strength modifier, 
as is normal for that weapon. 
Big monsters typically wield oversized weapons that 
deal extra dice of damage on a hit. Double the weapon 
dice if the creature is Large, triple the weapon dice if it's 
Huge, and quadruple the weapon dice if it's Gargantuan. 
For example, a Huge giant wielding an appropriately 
sized greataxe deals 3dl2 slashing damage (plus its 
Strength bonus), instead of the normalldl2 . 
A creature has disadvantage on attack rolls with a 
weapon that is sized for a larger attacker. You can rule 
that a weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes 
larger is too big for the creature to use at all. 
Overall Damage Output. To determine a monster's 
overall damage output, take the average damage it 
deals with each of its attacks in a round and add them 
together. If a monster has different attack options, use 
the monster's most effective attacks to determine its 
damage output. For example, a fire giant can make two 
greatsword attacks or one rock attack in a round. The 
greatsword attacks deal more damage, so that attack 
routine determines the fire giant's damage output. 
If a monster's damage output varies from round to 
round, calculate its damage output each round for the 
first three rounds of combat, and take the average. 
For example, a young white dragon has a multiattack 
routine (one bite attack and two claw attacks) that deals 
an average of 37 damage each round, as well as a breath 
weapon that deals 45 damage, or 90 if it hits two targets 
(and it probably will). In the first three rounds of combat, 
the dragon will probably get to use its breath weapon 
once and its multiattack routine twice, so its average 
damage output for the first three rounds would be (90 + 
37 + 37) + 3, or 54 damage (rounded down). 
When calculating a monster's damage output, also 
account for special off-turn damage-dealing features, 
such as auras, reactions, legendary actions, or lair 
ATTACK RIDERS 
Many monsters have attacks that do more than deal damage. 
Some effects that can be added to an attack to give it a 
flavorful twist include: 
• Adding damage of a different type to the attack 
• Having the monster grapple the target on a hit 
• Allowing the monster to knock the target prone on a hit 
• Imposing a condition on the target if the attack hits and 
the target fails a saving throw 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP actions. For example, a balor's Fire Aura deals 10 
fire damage to any creature that hits the balor with a 
melee attack. The aura also deals 10 fire damage to all 
creatures within 5 feet of the balor at the start of each 
of the balor's turns. If you assume that one character ~ 
the party is within 5 feet of the balor at all times, hittir::; 
it with a melee weapon every round, then the balor's 
damage output per round increases by 20. 
STEP 12. SAVE DCs 
A monster might have an attack or some other trait 
that requires a target to make a saving throw. The sa,·e 
DCs to resist such effects have a direct bearing on the 
monster's challenge rating, and vice versa. You can 
determine save DCs in one of two ways. 
Use the Table. You can start with the monster's 
expected challenge rating and use the Monster 
Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an 
appropriate save DC for any effect that requires a tar e· 
to make a saving throw. 
Calculate the DCs. Alternatively , you can calculate 
a monster's save DCs as follows: 8 + the monster's 
proficiency bonus + the monster's relevant ability 
modifier. You choose the ability that best applies. 
For example, if the effect is a poison, the relevant 
ability is probably the monster's Constitution. If 
the effect is similar to that of a spell, the relevant 
ability might be the monster's Intelligence, Wisdom, 
or Charisma . 
Don't worry if the save DCs aren't matching up with 
the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other 
factors can affect a monster's challenge rating, as 
shown in later steps, and you can always adjust the sa -
DCs later on. 
STEP 13. SPECIAL TRAITS , ACTIONS, AND 
REACTIONS 
Some special traits (such as Magic Resistance) , specia:. 
actions (such as· Superior Invisibility), and special 
reactions (such as Parry) can improve a monster's 
combat effectiveness and potentially increase its 
challenge rating. 
The Monster Features table list \·arious features that 
you can plunder from the Monster j\tfanual. The table 
notes which features increase a monster's effective 
Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus. or damage output 
for the purpose of determinin g its challenge rating. (The 
features don't actually change the monster's statistics-) 
Features that have no effect on a monster's challenge 
rating are noted with a dash(-)-
When assigning special traits, actions, or reactions 
to a monster, keep in mind that not all monsters need 
them. The more you add, the more complex (and harder 
to run) the monster becomes. 
Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting. The impact 
that the Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting special 
traits have on a monster's challenge rating depends 
on the spells that the monster can cast Spells that 
deal more damage than the monster's normal attack 
routine and spells that increase the monster's AC or 
hit points need to be accounted for when determining 
the monster's final challenge rating. See the "Special 
Traits" section in the introduction of the Monster 
Manual for more information on these two special traits. 
STEP 14. SPEED 
Every monster has a walking speed. (Immobile 
monsters have a walking speed of 0 feet) In addition to 
its walking speed, a monster might have one or more 
other speeds, including a burrowing, climbing, flying, or 
swimming speed. 
Flying Monster. Increase the monster's effective 
Armor Class by 2 (not its actual A C) if it can fly and deal 
damage at range and if its expected challenge rating 
is 10 or lower (higher-level characters have a greater 
ability to deal with flying creatures) . 
STEP 15. SAVING THROW BONUSES 
If you want a monster to be unusually resistant to 
certain kinds of effects, you can give it a bonus to saving 
throws tied to a particular ability. 
A saving throw bonus is best used to counteract a low 
ability score. For example, an undead monster with a 
low Wisdom score might need a Wisdom saving throw 
bonus to account for the fact that it's more difficult to 
charm, frighten, or turn than its Wisdom would indicate. 
A saving throw bonus is equal to the monster's 
proficiency bonus+ the monster's relevant 
ability modifier. 
A monster with three or more saving throw bonuses 
has a significant defensive advantage , so its effective AC 
(not its actual AC) should be raised when determining 
its challenge rating. If it has three or four bonuses, 
increase its effective AC by 2. If it has five or more 
bonuses, increase its effective AC by 4. 
STEP 16. FINAL CHALLENGE RATING 
At this point, you have all the statistical information 
you need to calculate the monster's final challenge 
rating. This step is identical to step 4 under "Creating 
Quick Monster Stats." Calculate the monster's defensive 
challenge rating and its offensive challenge rating, then 
take the average to get its final challenge rating. STEP 17. SKILL BONUSES 
If you want a monster to be proficient in a skill, you can 
give it a bonus equal to its proficiency bonus on ability 
checks related to that skill. For example, a monster 
with sharp senses might have a bonus on Wisdom 
(Perception) checks, while a duplicitous monster might 
have a bonus on Charisma (Deception) checks. 
You can double the proficiency bonus to account for 
heightened mastery. For example, a doppelganger is 
so good at deceiving others that its bonus on Charisma 
(Deception) checks is equal to double its proficiency 
bonus + its Charisma modifier. 
Skill bonuses have no bearing on a monster's 
challenge rating. 
STEP 18. CONDITION IMMUNITIES 
A monster can be immune to one or more debilitating 
conditions, and these immunities have no bearing on 
its challenge rating. For descriptions of the various 
conditions, see appendix A of the Player's Handbook. 
As with damage immunities, condition immunities 
should be intuitive and logical. For example, it makes 
sense that a stone golem can't be poisoned, since it's a 
construct without a nervous system or internal organs. 
STEP 19. SENSES 
A monster might have one or more of the following 
special senses, which are described in the Monster 
Manual: blindsight, darkvision, tremorsense, and 
truesight. Whether the monster has special senses or 
not has no bearing on its challenge rating. 
Passive Perception Score. All monsters have a 
passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which is most 
often used to determine whether a monster detects 
approaching or hidden enemies. A monster's passive 
Wisdom (Perception) score is 10 + its Wisdom modifier. 
If the monster has proficiency in the Perception skill, its 
score is 10 +its Wisdom (Perception) bonus. 
STEP 20. LANGUAGES 
Whether a monster can speak a language has no 
bearing on its challenge rating. 
A monster can master as many spoken languages as 
you want, although few monsters know more than one 
or two, and many monsters (beasts in particular) have 
no spoken language whatsoever. A monster that lacks 
the ability to speak might still understand a language. 
Telepathy. Whether or not a monster has telepathy 
has no bearing on its challenge rating. For more 
information on telepathy, see the Monster Manual. 
NPC STAT BLOCKS ----------------
Appendix B of the Monster Manual contains stat blocks 
for common NPC archetypes such as bandits and 
guards, as well as tips for customizing them. Those tips 
include adding racial traits from the Player's Handbook, 
equipping NPCs with magic items, and swapping armor, 
weapons , and spells.

CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
If you want to take an NPC stat block and adapt it for 
a specific monster race, apply the ability modifiers and 
add the features listed in the NPC Features table. If the 
NPC's AC, hit points, attack bonus, or damage changes, 
recalculate its challenge rating. • You can create an NPC stat block (similar to the ones 
in the Monster Manual) as you would a monster stat 
block, as discussed in the previous section. 
You can build the NPC as you would a player 
character, as discussed in the Player's Handbook. 
CREATING NPCs FROM SCRATCH If you decide to build an NPC the same way you build 
a player character, you can skip choosing a background 
and instead pick two skill proficiencies for the NPC. If you need completely new statistics for an NPC, you 
have two options:

CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
The NPC Features table summarizes the ability 
modifiers and features of variou nonhuman races, as 
well as various creatures from the Monster Manual with 
a challenge rating lower than 1. Apply these modifiers 
and add these features to the PCs stat block, then 
determine the NPC's challenge rating just as you would 
for a monster. Features that can affect a monster's 
challenge rating are listed in the Monster Features table. 
The NPC's proficiency bonus is determined by its level, 
just like a character , rather than by its challenge rating. 
If the monster you want to use isn't listed on the table, 
use the process described below under "Monsters 
with Classes." 
MONSTERS WITH CLASSES 
You can use the rules in chapter 3 of the Player's 
Handbook to give class levels to a monster. For example, 
you can turn an ordinary werewolf into a werewolf with 
four levels of the barbarian class (such a monster would 
be expressed as "Werewolf, 4th-level barbarian"). 
Start with the monster's stat block. The monster gains 
all the class features for every class level you add, with 
the following exceptions: 
The monster doesn't gain the starting equipment of 
the added class. 
For each class level you add, the monster gains one 
Hit Die of its normal type (based on its size), ignoring 
the class's Hit Die progression. 
The monster's proficiency bonus is based on its 
challenge rating, not its class levels. 
Once you finish adding class levels to a monster, 
feel free to tweak its ability scores as you see fit (for 
example, raising the monster's Intelligence score so 
that the monster is a more effective wizard), and make 
whatever other adjustments are needed. You'll need 
to recalculate its challenge rating as though you had 
designed the monster from scratch. 
Depending on the monster and the number of class 
levels you add to it, its challenge rating might change 
very little or increase dramatically . For example, a 
werewolf that gains four barbarian levels is a much 
greater threat than it was before. In contrast, the hit 
points, spells, and other class features that an ancient 
red dragon gains from five levels of wizard don't 
increase its challenge rating. 
CREATING A SPELL 
When creating a new spell, use existing spells as 
guidelines . Here are some things to consider: 
If a spell is so good that a caster would want to use it 
all the time, it might be too powerful for its level. 
A long duration or large area can make up for a lesser 
effect, depending on the spell. 
Avoid spells that have very limited use, such as one 
that works only against good dragons. Though such 
a spell could exist in the world, few characte rs will 
bother to learn or prepare it unless they know in 
advance that doing so will be worthwhile . 
• Make sure the spell fits with the identity of the class. 
Wizards and sorcerers don"t typically have access to healing spells, for example, and adding a healing spell 
to the wizard class list would step on the cleric's turf. 
SPELL DAMAGE -----------------------------For any spell that deals damage, use the Spell Damage 
table to determine approximately how much damage is 
appropriate given the spell's level. The table assumes 
the spell deals half damage on a successful saving 
throw or a missed attack. If your spell doesn't deal 
damage on a successful save, you can increase the 
damage by 25 percent. 
You can use different damage dice than the ones 
in the table, provided that the average result is about 
the same. Doing so can add a little variety to the spell. 
For example, you could change a cantrip's damage 
from ldlO (average 5.5) to 2d4 (average 5), reducing 
the maximum damage and making an average result 
more likely. 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER 'S WORKSHOP I, 
SPELL DAMAGE 
Spell Level One Target Multiple Targets 
Cantrip ldlO ld6 
l st 2dl0 2d6

6th lOdlO lld6 
7th lldlO l2d6 
8th l2dl0 l3d6 
9th lSdlO l4d6 
HEALING SPELLS 
You can also use the Spell Damage table to determine 
how many hit points a healing spell restores. A cantrip 
shouldn't offer healing. 
CREATING A MAGIC ITEM 
The magic items in chapter 7, "Treasure ," are but a few 
of the magic treasures that characters can discover 
during their adventures. If your players are seasoned 
veterans and you want to surprise them, you can either 
modify an existing item or come up with something new. 
MODIFYING AN ITEM 
The easiest way to invent a new item is to tweak an 
existing one. If a paladin uses a flail as her main 
weapon, you could change a holy avenger so that it's a 
flail instead of a sword. You can turn a ring of the ram 
into a wand, or a cloak of protection into a circlet of 
protection , all without altering the item's properties. 
Other substitutions are equally easy. An item that 
deals damage of one type can easily deal damage of 
another type. A flame tongue sword could deal lightning 
damage instead of fire, for example. One capability 
can replace another, so a potion of climbing can easily 
become a potion of stealth. 
You can also modify an item by fusing it with 
properties from another item. For example, you could 
combine the effects of a helm of comprehending 
languages with those of a helm of telepathy into a 
single helmet. This makes the item more powerful 
(and probably increases its rarity), but it won't break 
your game. 
Finally, remember the tools that are provided for 
modifying items in chapter 7, "Treasure ." Giving an item 
an interesting minor property , a quirk, or sentience can 
alter its flavor significantly . 
CREATING A NEW ITEM 
If modifying an item doesn't quite do the trick, you can 
create one from scratch. A magic item should either let a 
character do something he or she couldn't do before, or 
improve the character's ability to do something he or she 
can do already. For example, the ring of jumping lets its 
wearer jump greater distances, thus augmenting what 
a character can already do. A ring of the ram, however, 
gives a character the ability to deal force damage. 
The simpler your approach. the easier it is for a 
character to use the item in play. Giving the item 
charges is fine, especially if it ha several different 
abilities, but simply deciding that an item is always 
active or can be used a fixed number of times per day is 
easier to rna nage. 
POWER LEVEL 
If you make an item that lets a character kill whatever 
he or she hits with it, that item will likely unbalance your 
game. On the other hand, an item whose benefit rarely 
comes into play isn't much of a reward and probably not 
worth doling out as one. 
Use the Magic Item Power by Rarity table as a guide 
to help you determine how powerful an item should be, 
based on its rarity. 
MAGIC ITEM POWER BY RARITY 
Rarity Max Spell Level Max Bonus 
Common l st 
Uncommon 3rd +l 
Rare 6th +2 
Very rare 8th +3 
Legendary 9th +4 
Maximum Spell Level. This column of the table 
indicates the highest-level spell effect the item should 
confer, in the form of a once-per-day or similarly limited 
property. For example, a common item might confer 
the benefit of a 1st-level spell once per day (or just once, 
if it's consumable). A rare, very rare, or legendary item 
might allow its possessor to cast a lower-level spell 
more frequently. 
Maximum Bonus. If an item delivers a static bonus 
to AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks, this 
column suggests an appropriate bonus based on the 
item's rarity. 
ATTUNEMENT 
Decide whether the item requires a character to be 
attuned to it to use its properties. Use these rules of 
thumb to help you decide: 
If having all the characters in a party pass an item 
around to gain its lasting benefits would be disruptive, 
the item should require attunement. 
If the item grants a bonus that other items also 
grant, it's a good idea to require attunement so that 
characters don't try to collect too many of those items. 
CREATING NEW 
CHARACTER OPTIONS 
If the options for player characters in the Player's 
Handbook don't meet all the needs of your campaign, 
consult the following sections for advice on creating 
new race, class, and background options. 
CREATING A RACE OR SUBRACE ----
This section teaches you how to modify existing races, 
as well as create new ones. The most important step in 
customizing or designing races for your campaign is to start with the story behind the race or subrace you 
wish to create. Having a firm idea of a race's story in 
your campaign will help you make decisions during the 
creation process. Ask yourself several questions: 
Why does my campaign need the race to be playable? 
What does the race look like? 
How would I describe the race's culture? 
Where do the members of this race live? 
Are there interesting conflicts built into the race's 
history and culture that make the race compelling 
from a storytelling standpoint? 
• What is the race's relationship to the other 
playable races? 
• What classes and backgrounds are well suited to 
members of the race? 
What are the race's signature traits? 
• In the case of a new subrace, what sets it apart from 
the other subraces of the parent race? 
Compare the race you have in mind with the other 
race options available to players, to make sure that the 
new race doesn't pale in comparison to the existing 
options (which would result in the race being unpopular) 
or completely overshadow them (so that players don't 
feel as if the other options are inferior). 
When the time comes to design the game elements 
of the race, such as its traits, take a look at the game's 
existing races and let them inspire you. 
CosMETIC ALTERATIONS 
A simple way to modify an existing race is to change 
its appearance. Changes to a race's appearance need 
not affect its game elements. For example, you could 
transform halflings into anthropomorphic mice without 
changing their racial traits at all. 
CULTURAL ALTERATIONS 
In your world, elves might be desert nomads instead of 
forest dwellers, halflings might live in cloud cities, and 
dwarves might be sailors instead of miners. When you 
change the culture of a race, you can also make minor 
alterations to the race's proficiencies and traits to reflect 
that culture. 
For example, imagine that the dwarves of your world 
are seafarers and inventors of gunpowder. You could 
add the pistol and musket to the list of weapons that 
dwarves are proficient with, and give them proficiency 
with waterborne vehicles instead of artisan's tools. 
These two small changes tell a different story than 
the default assumptions about dwarves in the Player's 
Handbook , without changing the power level of the race. 
CREATING A NEW SUBRACE 
Creating a new subrace is more involved than making 
some minor tweaks to existing racial features, but it 
does have the advantage of increasing the diversity of 
options for a particular race, rather than replacing some 
options with other ones. 
The following example walks through the creation of 
an elf subrace: the eladrin. This subrace has history in 
the D&D multi verse, so you already have some stories to 
draw on when building its traits. 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
286 ExAMPLE SuBRACE: ELADRIN 
Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin 
live in the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities 
sometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing 
briefly in mountain valleys or deep forest glades before 
fading back into the Feywild. 
The elf subraces in the Player's Handbook include 
an ability score increase , a weapon training feature, 
and two or three additional traits. Given the story of 
the eladrin and their magical nature, an increase to an 
eladrin character's Intelligence is appropriate . There's 
no need to alter the basic weapon training shared by 
high elves and wood elves. 
An ability that sets the eladrin apart from other elves 
is their ability to step through the boundary between the 
planes, disappearing for a moment before reappearing 
somewhere else. In the game, this is reflected in a 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP limited use of the misty step spell. Since misty step is 
a 2nd-level spell, this ability is potent enough that the 
subrace doesn't need additional traits. This leaves us 
with the following features for the eladrin subrace: 
Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score 
increases by 1. 
Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the 
longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. 
Fey Step. You can cast the misty step spell once usin 
this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish 
a short or long rest. 
CREATING A NEW RACE 
When creating a race from scratch, begin with the 
story and proceed from there. Compare your creation 
to the other races of your world, and borrow freely 
from the traits of other races. As an example, consider 
the aasimar, a race similar to the tiefling but with a 
celestial heritage. 
EXAMPLE RACE: AASIMAR 
Whereas tieflings have fiendish blood in their veins, 
aasimar are the descendants of celestial beings. These 
folk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrou 
hair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often 
attempt to pass as humans in order to right wrongs and 
defend goodness on the Material Plane without drawin 
undue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive -
to fit into society, although they usually rise to the top, 
becoming revered leaders and honorable heroes. 
You might decide to use the aasimar as a counterpo in· 
to the tiefling race. The two races could even be at odd 
reflecting some greater conflict between the forces of 
good and evil in your campaign. 
Here are our basic goals for the aasimar: 
• Aasimar should make effective clerics and paladins. 
Aasimar should be to celestials and humans what 
tieflings are to fiends and humans. 
Given that aasimar and tieflings are like two sides of 
the same coin, the tiefling makes a good starting point 
for coming up with the new race's traits. Since we wam 
aasimar to be effective paladins and clerics, it makes 
sense to improve their Wisdom and Charisma instead o: 
Intelligence and Charisma. 
Like tieflings, aasimar have darkvision . Instead of 
resistance to fire damage, we give them resistance 
to radiant damage to reflect their celestial nature. 
However , radiant damage isn't as common as fire 
damage, so we give them resistance to necrotic damage 
as well, making them good at facing undead. 
The tiefling's Infernal Legacy trait is a good model 
for a similar trait to reflect a magical, celestial heritage. 
replacing the tiefling's spells with spells of similar leveL 
that more closely match the aasimar's celestial ancestrY. 
However , the aasimar's expanded resistance might -
require limiting this trait to basic utility spells. 
Filling in the remaining details, we end up with the 
following racial traits for the aasimar: 
Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases 
by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2. 
Age. Aasimar mature at the arne rate as humans but 
live a few years longer. 
Alignment. Due to their celestial heritage, aasimar 
are often good. However, some aasimar fall into evil, 
rejecting their heritage. 
Size. Aasimar are built like well-proportioned 
humans. Your size is Medium. 
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Darkvision. Thanks to your celestial heritage, you 
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You 
can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You 
can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 
Celestial Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic 
damage and radiant damage. 
Celestial Legacy. You know the light can trip. Once 
you reach 3rd level, you can cast the lesser restoration 
spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do 
so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, 
you can cast the daylight spell once with this trait as a 
3rd-level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when 
you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting 
ability for these spells. 
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and Celestial. 
MODIFYING A CLASS 
The classes in the Player's Handbook capture a wide 
range of character archetypes , but your campaign world 
might have need of something more. The following 
section discusses ways to modify existing classes to 
better serve your game's needs. 
CHANGING PROFICIENCIES 
Changing a class's proficiencies is a safe and simple way 
to modify a class to better reflect your world. Swapping 
out one skill or tool proficiency for another doesn't make 
a character any stronger or weaker, but doing so can 
change the flavor of a class in subtle ways. 
For example, a prominent guild of rogues in your 
world might worship a patron deity, performing secret 
missions in that deity's name. To reflect this cultural 
detail, you could add Religion to the list of skills that a 
rogue character can choose as a proficiency. You could 
even mandate that skill as one of the choices for rogues 
who belong to this guild. 
You can also change armor and weapon proficiencies 
to reflect certain aspects of your world. For example, 
you could decide that the clerics of a particular deity 
belong to an order that forbids the accumulation of 
material goods, other than magic items useful for their 
divine mission. Such clerics carry a staff, but they 
are forbidden from wearing armor or using weapons 
other than that staff. To reflect this, you could remove 
the armor and weapon proficiencies for clerics of this 
faith, making them proficient with the quarterstaff and 
nothing else. You could give them a benefit to make up 
for the loss of proficiencies -something like the monk's 
Unarmored Defense class feature, but presented as a 
divine blessing. CHANGING SPELL LISTS 
Modifying a class's spell list usually has little effect on 
a character's power but can change the flavor of a class 
significantly. In your world, paladins might not swear 
their oaths to ideals, but instead swear fealty to powerful 
sorcerers. To capture this story concept, you could build 
a new paladin spell list with spells meant to protect 
their masters, drawn from the sorcerer or wizard lists. 
Suddenly, the paladin feels like a different class. 
Be cautious when changing the warlock spell list. 
Since warlocks regain their spell slots after a short rest, 
they have the potential to use certain spells more times 
in a day than other classes do. 
RESTRICTING CLASS ACCESS 
Without changing the way a class functions, you can 
root it more firmly in the world by associating the class 
with a particular race or culture. 
For example, you might decide that bards, sorcerers, 
warlocks, and wizards represent the magical traditions 
of four different races or cultures. The bardic colleges 
might be closed to everyone except elves, dragonborn 
might be the only creatures capable of becoming 
sorcerers, and all warlocks in your world might be 
human. You could break that down still further: bards 
of the College of Lore could be high elves, and bards 
of the College of War could be wood elves. Gnomes 
discovered the school of illusion, so all wizards who 
specialize in that school are gnomes. Different human 
cultures produce warlocks with different pacts, and 
so on. Similarly, different cleric domains might reflect 
entirely separate religions associated with different 
races or cultures. 
You decide how flexible you want to be in allowing 
a player character to break these restrictions. Can a 
half-elf live among the elves and study their bardic 
traditions? Can a dwarf stumble into a warlock pact 
despite having no connection to a culture that normally 
produces warlocks? As always, it's better to say yes and 
use the player's desire as an opportunity to develop the 
character's story and that of your world, rather than 
shutting down possibilities. 
SUBSTITUTING CLASS FEATURES 
If one or more features of a given class don't exactly 
fit the theme or tone of your campaign , you can pull 
them out of the class and replace them with new 
ones. In doing so, you should strive to make sure 
that the new options are just as appealing as the 
ones you are removing , and that the substitute class 
features contribute to the class's effectiveness at social 
interaction, exploration, or combat just as well as those 
being replaced. 
Ultimately , a class exists to help a player express a 
particular character concept, and any class feature you 
replace is also removing an aspect of that character. 
Substituting a class feature should be done only to fit a 
specific need for your campaign, or to appeal to a player 
trying to create a specific kind of character (perhaps one 
modeled after a character from a novel, TV series, comic 
book, or movie). 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
288 The first step is to figure out what class feature or 
group of class features you're going to replace. Then 
you need to evaluate what each feature provides to the 
class, so that the features you are adding don't make the 
class over-or underpowered. Ask yourself the following 
questions about a feature you're replacing: 
What impact does replacing the feature have on 
exploration, social interaction, or combat? 
Does replacing the feature affect how long the party 
can continue adventuring in a day? 
Does the feature consume resources provided 
elsewhere in the class? 
Does the feature work all the time, or is it regained 
after a short rest, a long rest, or some other 
length of time? 
Armed with answers to these questions, you can start 
designing new features that replace the ones you are 
removing. It's fine if the new class features drift closer 
to exploration, social interaction, or combat than the 
ones you are replacing , but be wary of going too far. 
For example, if you replace an exploration-focused 
feature with something purely combat focused, you've 
just made that class more powerful in combat, and it 
could overshadow the other classes in a way that you 
didn't intend. 
There's no formula that can tell you how to design 
new class features. The best place to start is by looking 
at other class features, or at spells, feats, or any other 
rules for inspiration. You're almost certainly going to 
have some missteps, as features that seem good on the 
surface fall apart in play. That's all right. Everything 
you design will need to be playtested. When introducing 
new class features, be sure the players using them are 
comfortable with the fact that you might need to go back 
and make some changes after seeing them in play., 
CREATING NEW CLASS OPTIONS 
Each class has at least one major choice point. Clerics 
choose a divine domain, fighters choose a martial 
archetype, wizards choose an arcane tradition , and 
so forth. Creating a new option doesn't require you to 
remove anything from the class, but any new option 
you add should be compared to existing options to 
make sure it's no more or less powerful , yet remains 
distinctive in flavor. Like anything in class design, be 
prepared to playtest your ideas and make changes if 
things aren't playing out the way you want them to. 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP Once you have the concept for the class option in 
mind, it's time to design the specifics. If you're not sure 
where to begin, look at the existing options and see w -
class features they provide. It's perfectly acceptable for 
two class options to have similar features, and it's al o 
fine to look at other classes for examples of mechanics 
you can draw on for inspiration. As you design each 
class feature, ask the following questions: 
How does the class feature reinforce the story or 
theme of the class option? 
Is there an existing feature that can be used 
as a model? 
How does the new class feature compare to other 
features of the same level? 
VARIANT: SPELL POINTS 
One way to modify how a class feels is to change how _ 
uses its spells. With this variant system, a character \ 
has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead 
spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more 
flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity. 
In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on -~ 
level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cosr -
spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don·· 
require slots and therefore don't require spell points. 
Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast you;­
spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool 
of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell 
points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then us~ 
that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell po-­
total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell poin­
when you finish a long rest. 
Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing­
cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each 
level of 6th or higher. You can't create another slot of · -
same level until you finish a long rest. 
The number of spell points you have to spend is ba 
on your level as a spellcaster , as shown in the Spell 
Points by Level table. Your level also determines the 
maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though 
you might have enough points to create a slot above this 
maximum, you can't do so. 
The Spell Points by Level table applies to bards, 
clerics, druids, sorcerers , and wizards. For a paladin o~ 
ranger, halve the character's level in that class and the 
consult the table. For a fighter (Eidritch Knight) or ro 
(Arcane Trickster), divide the character's level in that 
class by three. 
This system can be applied to monsters that cast 
spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that 
you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a 
monster can be a hassle.

CREATING A BACKGROUND 
A well-crafted background can help a player create a 
character that feels like an exciting addition to your 
campaign. It helps define the character's place in the 
world, rather than what a character is in terms of game 
mechanics. 
Instead of focusing on a generic character 
background, such as merchant or wanderer, think 
about the factions, organizations, and cultures of 
your campaign and how they might be leveraged to 
create flavorful backgrounds for player characters. For 
example, you could create an acolyte of Candlekeep 
background that is functionally similar to a sage 
background, but which ties a character more closely to a 
place and organization in your world. 
A character with the acolyte of Candlekeep 
background probably has friends among the 
Avowed-the monks who maintain the great library 
at Candlekeep. The character can enter the library 
and consult its lore freely, while others must donate 
a rare or valuable tome of knowledge before they are 
allowed entry. Candlekeep 's enemies are the character's 
enemies, and its allies, the character 's friends. Acolytes 
of Candlekeep are generally regarded as learned sages 
and protectors of knowledg e. It's possible to envision 
many interesting interactions as NPCs discover the 
character's background and approach the character in 
search of assistance. 
To create your own background, follow these steps. 
STEP 1. ROOT lT IN YOUR WORLD 
To ground a new background in your campaign 's 
setting, determine what element of your campaign the 
background is tied to: a faction. an organizatio n, a trade, 
a person, an event, or a location. STEP 2. SUGGEST PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS 
Create tables of suggested characteristics-personality 
traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws-that fit the background , 
or plunder entries from the tables presented in the 
Player's Handbook. Even if your players don't use 
the tables, this step helps you paint a picture of the 
background's place in your world. The tables need not 
be extensive; two or three entries per table are enough. 
STEP 3. ASSIGN PROFICIENCIES OR LANGUAGES 
Choose two skill proficiencies and two tool proficiencies 
for the background. You can replace tool proficiencies 
with languages on a one-for-one basis. 
STEP 4'. INCLUDE STARTING EQUIPMENT 
Make sure your background offers a package of starting 
equipment. In addition to a small amount of money that 
a character can use to buy adventuring gear, the starting 
equipment should include items that a character would 
have acquired prior to becoming an adventurer, as well 
as one or two items unique to the background. 
For example, starting equipment for a character with 
the acolyte of Candlekeep background might include a 
set of traveler's clothes, a scholar's robe, five candles, 
a tinderbox, an empty scroll case engraved with the 
symbol of Candlekeep , and a belt pouch containing 10 
gp. The scroll case might be a gift given to an acolyte of 
Candlekeep who embarks on a life of adventure. At your 
discretion , it might also contain a useful map. 
STEP 5. SETTLE ON A BACKGROUND FEATURE 
Choose an existing background feature or create a new 
one, as you prefer. If you choose an existing feature, add 
or tweak a few details to make it unique. 
For example, the acolyte of Candlekeep background 
might have the Researcher feature of the sage (as 
presented in the Player's Handbook), with the additional 
benefit that the character is allowed to enter Candlekeep 
without paying the normal cost. 
A background feature should avoid strict game 
benefits, such as a bonus to an ability check or an attack 
roll. Instead, the feature should open up new options for 
roleplaying , exploring, and otherwise interacting with 
the world. 
For example, the sage's Researcher feature is 
designed to send the character on adventures. It doesn't 
provide information or an automatic success for a check. 
Instead, if a character with the sage background fails 
to recall information , he or she instead knows where to 
learn it. This might be a pointer to another sage or to a 
library long lost within an ancient tomb. 
The best background features give characters 
a reason to strike out on quests, to make contact 
with NPCs, and to develop bonds to the setting 
you've devised. 
CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP 
290 APPENDIX A: RANDOM DUNGEONS 
HIS APPENDIX HELPS YOU QUICKLY GENERAT E 
a dungeon. The tables work in an iterative 
manner. First, roll a starting area, then roll to 
determine the passages and doors found in 
that area. One you have initial passages and 
doors, determine the location and nature of 
subsequent passages, doors, chambers , stairs, and so 
on-each of them generated by rolls on different tables. 
Following these instructions can lead to sprawling 
complexes that more than fill a single sheet of graph 
paper. If you want to constrain the dungeon , establish 
limits ahead of time on how far it can grow. 
The most obvious limit to a dungeon's size is the 
graph paper it's drawn on. If a feature would exceed 
the boundaries of the page, curtail it. A corridor might 
turn or come to a dead end at the map's edge, or you can 
make a chamber smaller to fit the available space. 
Alternatively, you can decide that passages leading off 
the edge of the map are additional dungeon entrances. 
Stairs, shafts, and other features that would normally 
lead to levels you don't plan to map can serve a 
similar purpose. 
STARTING AREA 
The Starting Area table produces a chamber or a set of 
corridors at the entrance to your dungeon. When rolling 
for a random starting area, pick one of the doors or 
passages leading into the starting area as the entrance 
to the dungeon as a whole. 
Once you've selected the entrance , roll on the 
appropriate table for each passage or door leading away 
from the starting area. Passages each extend 10 feet 
beyond the starting area. After that point, check on the 
Passage table for each passage to determine what lies 
beyond. Use the Beyond a Door table to determine what 
lies behind doors and secret doors.

APPENDIX A I RANDOM DUNGEONS PASSAGES 
When generating passages and corridors , roll on the 
Passage table multiple times, extending the length and 
branches of any open passage on the map until you 
arrive at a door or chamber. 
Whenever you create a new passage, roll to determine 
its width. If the passage branches from another passage 
roll a d12 on the Passage Width table. If it comes from 
a chamber, roll a d20 on that table, but the width of the 
passage must be at least 5 feet smaller than the longest 
dimension of the chamber.

CHAMBERS 
Whenever a roll on a table indicates a chamber, use the 
Chamber table to define its dimensions. Then roll on the 
Chamber Exits table to determine the number of exits. 
For each exit, roll on the Exit Location and Exit Type 
tables to determine the nature and placement of the exit. 
Use the tables in the "Stocking a Dungeon" section to 
determine the contents of a chamber.

APPENDIX A I RANDOM DUNGEONS 
CONNECTING AREAS 
When your map is done, consider adding doors between 
chambers and passages that are next to each other but 
otherwise not connected. Such doors create more paths 
through the dungeon and expand players' options. 
If your dungeon consists of more than one level, be 
sure that any stairs, pits, and other vertical passages 
line up between levels. If you're using graph paper, 
lay a new page on top of your existing map, mark the 
locations of stairs and other features shared by the two 
levels, and begin mapping the new level. 
STOCKING A DUNGEON 
Creating a map for your dungeon is only half the fun. 
Once you have the layout, you need to decide what 
challenges and rewards are to be found in the dungeon's 
passages and chambers. Any reasonably large space 
should be stocked with interesting sights, sounds, 
objects, and creatures . 
You don't need to have every last detail of your 
dungeon plotted out. You can get by with nothing more 
than a list of monsters, a list of treasures, and a list of 
one or two key elements for each dungeon area. 
CHAMBER PURPOSE 
A room's purpose can help determine its furnishings 
and other contents. 
For each chamber on your dungeon map, establish its 
purpose or use the tables below to generate ideas. Each 
type of dungeon described in the "Dungeon Purpose " 
APPENDIX A I RANDOM DUNGEONS section of chapter 5, "Adventur e Environments, " has its 
own table featuring chambers geared to the dungeon 's 
purpose. For example, if you're building a tomb, use the 
Dungeon: Tomb table to help you determine the purpose 
of each chamber. These dungeon-specific tables are 
followed by the General Dungeon Chambers table, 
which you can use if your dungeon isn't an exact fit for 
one of the standard types of dungeon or if you want to 
mix things up. 
Relying on random rolls to stock an entire dungeon 
can lead to incongruous results. A tiny room might end 
up being identified as a temple, while the huge chamber 
next door serves as storage. It can be fun to try to make 
sense of such strange design ideas, but make changes 
as you see fit. You can set aside a few key rooms and 
create specific contents for them.

CHAMBER CONTENTS 
Once you have a sense of the purpose of the various 
dungeon chambers , you can think about the contents 
of those areas. The Dungeon Chamber Contents table 
allows you to randomly roll contents for a chamber, or 
you can choose contents for specific areas. If you choose 
contents , be sure to include an interesting , colorful 
assortment of things. In addition to the contents shown 
on this table, refer to "Dungeon Dressing" later in this 
appendix for additiona l items and elements to fill rooms. 
In the Dungeon Chamber Contents table, a "dominant 
inhabitant " is a creature that controls an area. Pets 
and allied creatures are subservient to the dominant 
inhabitant. "Random creatures" are scavengers or 
nuisances, usually lone monsters or small groups 
passing through the area. They include such creatures 
as carrion crawlers, dire rats, gelatinous cubes, and rust 
monsters. See chapter 3, "Creating Adventures, " for 
more information on random encounters.

MONSTERS AND MOTIVATIONS 
See chapter 3, "Creating Adventures, " for guidance on 
creating encounters with monsters. To foster variety 
and suspense, be sure to include encounte rs of varying 
difficulty. 
A powerful creature encountered early in the dungeon 
sets an exciting tone and forces the adventurers to 
rely on their wits. For example, an ancient red dragon 
APPENDIX A I RANDOM DUNGEONS might slumber on the first level of a dungeon, a pall of 
smoke and the sound of its heavy breathing filling the 
chambers near its lair. Clever characters will do their 
utmost to avoid the dragon, even as the party's brave 
thief makes off with a few coins from its hoard. 
Not all monsters are automatically hostile. When 
placing monsters in your dungeon , consider their 
relationships to nearby creatures and their attitudes 
toward adventurers. Characters might be able to 
appease a hungry beast by offering it food, and smarter 
creatures have complex motivations. The Monster 
Motivation table lets you use a monster's goals to define 
its presence in the dungeon. 
For large groups of monsters encountered across 
multiple chambers , motivation could apply to the entire 
group, or each subgroup could have conflicting goals.

RANDOM DUNGEON HAZARDS 
Hazards are rarely found in inhabited areas, because 
monsters either clear them away or avoid them. 
Shriekers and violet fungi are described in the 
Monster Manual. The other hazards on the table are 
described in chapter 5, "Adventure Environments."

RANDOM OBSTACLES 
Obstacles block progress through the dungeon. In some 
cases, what adventurers consider an obstacle is an 
easy path for the dungeon 's inhabitants. For example, 
a flooded chamber is a barrier to many characters but 
easily navigated by water-breathing creatures. 
Obstacles can affect more than one room. A chasm 
might run through several passages and chambers, 
or send cracks through the stonework in a wider area 
around it. An area of battering winds that emanates 
from a magic altar could stir the air less dangerously for 
hundreds of feet in all directions.

RANDOM TRAPS 
If you need a trap quickly or want to drop random 
traps into a dungeon, use the sample traps presented 
in chapter 5, "Adventur e Environments " or the tables 
below. If you use the tables, start with the Trap Effects 
and Trap Trigger tables to decide the type of trap, 
then use the Trap Damage Severity tables to decide 
how deadly it should be. For more information on trap 
damage severity, see chapter 5.

RANDOM TRICKS 
Tricks are quirkier and less deadly than traps. Some 
are effects left behind by the dungeon's creators, while 
others might be manifestations of the strange magical 
energy suffusing the dungeon. 
The following tables allow you to generate random 
tricks. Roll first to determin e an object that the trick 
is placed on, then roll to determine the nature of the 
trick. Some tricks are permanent effects that can't be 
dispelled; others are temporary or can be neutralized 
with a dispel magic spell. You decide which is which.
