#### ON THE COVER

A wizard of the Izzet League exults in the success of her latest experiment, while the draconic master of her guild looks on-and a detachment of Boros Legion angels hurries to ensure no innocents are harmed. Artist Magali Villeneuve has been painting MAGIC" cards since 2013.

Disclaimer: The Living Guildpact is not responsible for the fate of those who are arrested by the Azorius, beaten by the Boros, dodged by the Dimir, grossed out by the Golgari, gored by the Gruul, imploded by the Izzet, outwitted by the Orzhov, rousted by the Rakdos, subsumed by the Selesnya, or sickened by the Simic. Join or leave a guild at your own risk, and get caught up in guild politics at your peril.

Io: Jace Beleren From: Deputy Lavinia Re: The Guildpact

Listen up, "Living Guildpact." You think you know everything, but you have much to learn about Ravnica, the quilds, and this role you had the andacity to assume.

you don't appreciate how delicate the balance is among the ten quilds. Every time one quildmaster decides to make a play for the tiniest scrap of extrainfluence, it sets off a chain reaction that you have to stop. Because if you don't stop it, it will grow
and grow until the whole damned city is at war.

The original Guildpact took ten distinct cultures with their own ways of life, belief systems, and authority structures; put an end to their raging war; and forged them into one society.

Now, like it or not, the Guildpact is you. All the magical authority that keeps the quilds from one another's throats is embodied in you.

That's why I've pulled these notes together. Read them, Jace, and remember that the lives of millions of people depend on you. And don't just read. Emerge from your stuffy "sanctum"

Do that long enough, and maybe someday you'll deserve the title you carry.

and be among the people. Every quild. Understand them.

And for Ravnica's sake, stop disappearing all the time. Lavinia

Thanks. I've got something this my full attention when I return.

# WELCOME TO RAVNICA

ROM THE BACK OF HER SOARING ROC, A SKY knight surveys the spire-studded cityscape below. As the morning fog dissipates under the chill autumn sun, the city spreads out as far as she can see: lofty cathedrals, squat courthouses, towering apartments. sprawling tenements, cobblestone plazas, and broken ruins where once-majestic buildings have crumbled to rubble. She imagines the teeming masses below her: humans, elves, vedalken, minotaurs, goblins, loxodons, and other peoples, as some of them rise to greet the morning and others retire after a hard night of work or play. They are the reason she is here: sworn to protect them, she leads a flight of roc riders toward the fires raging in Precinct Three. Soldiers on the ground will put out the flames, while it's her job to deal with their source: the dragon she can just make out, clinging to the spire of a distant tower. Standing in her stirrups and raising her sword, she turns her mount toward the dragon, ready to battle once again for the sake of Ravnica.

Ravnica is a whole new world for your DUNGEONS & DRAGONS campaign to explore. A vast, sprawling city that covers the whole of the known world, Ravnica teems with intrigue and adventure, driven by the conflicts among the ten powerful guilds that rule the city.

Ravnica originally appeared as a setting for the MAGIC: THE GATHERING trading card game. It has been the subject of eight card sets: 2005-6's Ravnica: City of Guilds, Guildpact, and Dissension; 2012-13's Return to Ravnica, Gatecrash, and Dragon's Maze; and 2018-19's Guilds of Ravnica and Ravnica Allegiance. Among fans of MAGIC, Ravnica is one of the most popular settings, in part because the world's ten guilds strongly support the way players build MAGIC decks.

As it turns out, Ravnica's ten guilds also provide a great framework for a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS campaign. They offer character archetypes, competing factions that player characters can join, and abundant opportunities to develop and drive a campaign driven by the guilds' schemes and interactions.

This book, then, is your point of entry into Ravnica as a setting for your D&D campaign. It guides you through the process of creating characters and adventures set here.

Chapter 1 is all about building characters. It offers new race and class options, reflecting the unique character of Ravnica as a MAGIC setting, and the creatures and characters seen on MAGIC cards. You can also use this material in any other D&D setting.

Race and class are only the skeleton of a character. though, and chapter 2 is aimed at helping you add flesh to those bones in order to make a character who is an integrated part of Ravnica's tapestry of guilds. The ten guilds are detailed in chapter 2, and each section includes a background that reflects a character's membership in the guild. This chapter also describes opportunities for characters to advance in rank and position within their guilds by acquiring renown.

The focus of chapter 3 is on the city itself-and particularly on the Tenth District, which is the heart of Ravnica. The important precincts and neighborhoods of the district are described in broad overview, allowing you, as DM, plenty of leeway for developing the specifics of places and NPCs.

Chapter 4 is all about adventures in Ravnica, expanding on the material in the Dungeon Master's Guide with hundreds of seeds that can grow into full-fledged adventures in the fertile ground of a DM's imagination. This chapter also includes a short starting adventure you can use to launch a Ravnica campaign.

Chapter 5 includes magic items and other treasures for use as rewards in a Ravnica campaign. Many of these magic items are D&D interpretations of specific MAGIC artifact cards-not literal translations of their mechanics from one rules system to the other, but game elements inspired by the flavor and abilities of the cards.

Chapter 6 presents new monsters and NPCs, again reflecting the creatures seen on MAGIC cards as well as the nature of each guild. The guildmaster of each guild is detailed in this chapter, as are a variety of guild members.

# CITY OF GUILDS

In all their fantastic diversity, the cosmopolitan citizens of Ravnica go about their daily business in bustling markets and shadowy back alleys. Shambling pack animals (mammals, reptiles, insects, and bizarre hybrids alike) carry their loads through the streets, while untamed wild things lurk in verdant greenbelts, rubble-strewn ruins, and sewers. And interwoven throughout it all, ten guilds vie for power, wealth, and influence:

Azorius Senate. The Azorius Senate functions as the government of Ravnica, built on the three columns of a legislative, a judicial, and an executive branch under the leadership of Isperia, the sphinx Supreme Judge.

- Boros Legion. Led by the angel Aurelia, the Boros Legion pursues the cause of justice, not merely law enforcement. Boros serves as Ravnica's standing army.
- House Dimir. House Dimir is in the business of information, operating an espionage organization behind a facade of messengers, investigators, and archivists. Its enigmatic leader, Lazav, wears many faces.

#### RANDOM GUILDS

Sometimes you might want to choose a guild at random. Here's a table you can use in those situations.

| d10 | Guild |
| --- | --- |
| ੀ | Azorius Senate |
| 2 | Boros Legion |
|  | House Dimir |
| 3 4 5 | Golgari Swarm |
|  | Gruul Clans |
| ୧ | Izzet League |
| 7 | Orzhov Syndicate |
| 8 | Cult of Rakdos |
| 9 | Selesnya Conclave |
| 10 | Simic Combine |

Golgari Swarm. An elf lich named Jarad guides the Golgari Swarm's masses as they lurk in the undercity, where they process the city's waste and see to the new life that emerges from death and decay.

- Gruul Clans. Raging against civilization and its defilement of the natural world, the loose alliance of the Gruul Clans is led by the cyclops Borborygmos.
- Izzet League. Led by the dragon Niv-Mizzet, the Izzet League is a guild of scientists and engineers who build and sustain Ravnica's infrastructure while conducting wild experiments in magic-efforts that usually involve barely controlled elemental energy.
- Orzhov Syndicate. A sinister combination of church, bank, and organized crime syndicate, the Orzhov Syndicate is controlled by the Obzedat, a cabal of ancient spirits often called the Ghost Council.
- Cult of Rakdos. The demonic Cult of Rakdos is the jester in Ravnica's culture, using satire and performance to skewer the powerful and embolden the weak. But it is a cruel and bloodthirsty jester, in the manner of its demonic leader, and it supplements parody and levity with blood and fire.
- Selesnya Conclave. The Selesnya Conclave is led by Trostani, three dryads who are fused together with one another and with Mat Selesnya, a manifestation of the soul of the world. The guild seeks to bring nature and the city into balance.
- Simic Combine. Under the leadership of Prime Speaker Zegana, the biomancers of the Simic Combine apply magic to the life sciences. Striving to create a harmonious future where creatures of all kinds are perfectly adapted to their ever-changing environment, the Simic magically hasten the process of evolution and adaptation of life.

These ten guilds stand as the foundation of power on Ravnica. Each maintains a distinctive identity and civic function, a diverse collection of creatures, and a subculture of its own. The guilds' history is a web of wars, intrigue, and political machinations stretching over the millennia during which they have vied for control of the world. Their roles were established thousands of years ago in a magical treaty called the Guildpact, which not only assigned each guild a function, but also enforced an uneasy peace among them.

# HISTORY OF RAVNICA

More than ten thousand years ago, a war tore across the world of Ravnica. Ten armies battled for control of the world in a conflict that ended with the creation of a magical contract of immense power known as the Guildpact. The leaders of each of the ten armies-ancient beings known as paruns-were the signatories to the Guildpact, and they became the first guildmasters of Ravnica.

The text of the Guildpact spelled out specific roles for each guild within the infrastructure of Ravnica, allowing the city to grow while the guilds coexisted in relative peace. But the true power of the Guildpact was the strength of its magically binding force, which absolutely prevented large-scale violence among the guilds.

For ten millennia, the city grew and flourished under this structure as the guilds evolved into unique and powerful forces, often venturing far from their original purpose.

The signing of the Guildpact marked the beginning of the modern Ravnican calendar. Years prior to that pivotal event are denoted as "Al Concordant," or AC, and counted backward from 1 AC. Years after the signing are "Zal Concordant," ZC. The current date is 10,076 ZC, usually referred to as '76.

### THE GUILDPACT

During the Decamillennial Celebration of 10,000 ZC, commemorating a monumental anniversary of the Guildpact's signing, the pact was broken, the ancient balance was shattered, and Ravnica was thrown into chaos. It didn't take long for wealthy power-mongers to begin seizing control of elements in the city, turning the guilds to their service instead of the other way around. Eventually, the ten-thousand-year-old guild culture and division of duties reasserted itself. The ten guilds regained their dominant positions, but without the magically binding force of the Guildpact to maintain the balance among them.

Years later, in 10,075 ZC, the Izzet guildmaster discovered that Azor, founder of the Azorius Senate, had created a contingency plan that would take effect if the magic of the Guildpact were ever broken. An intricate network of ley lines sprawling across the districts of Ravnica, called the Implicit Maze, offered a test to the guilds: if they could cooperate to solve the maze, they would secure the power of a new Guildpact. That power was eventually bestowed-incarnated, actually-in the person of Jace Beleren, who became the Living Guildpact. His word became the binding law of Ravnica. Any law he verbally confirmed became magically unbreakable, and the responsibility of keeping the guilds in balance fell to him.

#### A PRECARIOUS PEACE

Jace is a Planeswalker, with the ability to travel from world to world, and his attention never remains focused on Raynica for long. Thanks to his involvement with other Planeswalkers, he spends extended periods of time away from Ravnica. During his absences, Ravnica has to fend for itself, and that means that the guilds return to their old habits of fighting with each other over

#### RAVNICA'S CALENDAR

Ravnica's year of 365 days is made up of twelve months, each of which has the same number of days as its counterpart in the Gregorian calendar. The year begins with 1 Seleszeni, which corresponds to March 1.

| Month | Name |
| --- | --- |
| - | Seleszeni (March) |
| 2 | Dhazo (April) |
| 3 | Prahz (May) |
| ব | Mokosh (June) |
| 5 | Paujal (July) |
| 6 | Cizarm (August) |
| 7 | Tevnember (September) |
| 8 | Golgar (October) |
| ወ | Quaegar (November) |
| 10 | Xivaskir (December) |
| 11 | Griev (January) |
| 12 | Zuun (February) |

The annual celebration of the Guildpact begins on 28 Zuun and extends overnight into 1 Seleszeni.

the smallest scraps of influence that could tilt the balance of power in their favor.

These conflicts erupt in a variety of forms. Sometimes guilds clash violently in the streets: Boros forces try to quell Gruul riots, Azorius arresters raid a Rakdos murder show, or Selesnya forces come together to repel a Golgari incursion. More often, sinister plots unfold in secret, through infiltration, sabotage, theft, and deception. Schemes are hidden beneath layers of other schemes, making the intention behind them nearly impossible to discover. The guildmasters are often the source of these plots, but sometimes subordinates attack other guilds to gain more influence within their own. In the absence of the Guildpact, some people believe that it's only a matter of time until these schemes and skirmishes escalate into all-out war on a scale that Ravnica hasn't known for ten millennia.

With the precarious peace always hanging in the balance, opportunities abound for adventurers to serve their guilds or advance their own agendas. Whether delving into the dungeons of the undercity, pursuing assassins through the bustling streets, negotiating accords among the rich and powerful, or sniffing out corruption in the halls of law, the characters in a Ravnica campaign have a world of adventure to explore.

# LIFE IN THE BIG CITY

Ravnica is a vast city, covering the entirety of the world in many layers of construction, from deep sewers and catacombs to sky-raking spires. No single map can encompass the tremendous scope of its sprawl, and its borders (if it has any) are unknown, except possibly to those who live near the edges.

The story of Ravnica focuses on its core. Sometimes called the city proper, this core is divided into ten districts, each of which is a huge urban environment in its own right. The districts are named in simple numerical order from the First to the Tenth. No correlation exists between the ten guilds and the ten districts; all ten guilds are active in all ten districts. The Tenth District, in particular, is a hotbed of activity where all the guilds maintain their primary headquarters. It is the focus of chapter 3.

A huge avenue called the Transguild Promenade runs through all ten districts, making it the most notable landmark for navigation through the city's heart. Lined with markets, small parks, and colonnades, the Promenade is a commercial thoroughfare used to transport loads of cargo. On celebration days, it becomes the city's most popular parade route. Even when guild conflicts run hot, Ravnicans respect the sanctity of the Promenade as neutral ground.

Beyond the core are an uncounted number of other districts, which originated as outlying cities that gradually melded into the expanding metropolis. Well-known districts outside the core include the Smelting District, Irbitov (the mausoleum district), and Jezeru (the lake district).

Districts, whether in the city proper or beyond it, are the fundamental configurations that define Ravnica. They are informally divided into various quarters, neighborhoods, and the like. Some of these areas extend across district boundaries. Deadbridge, for example, existed as a well-defined neighborhood before Ravnica City was formally divided into ten districts, and that division was made without consideration of Deadbridge's informally acknowledged boundaries. Part of Deadbridge, known as Deadbridge Chasm, occupies much of the Tenth District's Precinct Six, but it extends out into the neighboring area. Similar neighborhoods, both within and outside the city proper, include the Steambath Quarter, the Wrights' Quarter, and Mahovna, the Haven of Moss.

#### GUILD INSIGNIA

Members of Ravnica's guilds typically carry guild insignia with them, though in some cases (notably House Dimir) the insignia might be carefully hidden. A replacement insignia costs 5 gp and is available only to members of the guild. Any character can use the insignia of their guild as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook.

### CURRENCY: ZIBS AND ZINOS

This book uses standard D&D coinage, as detailed in the Player's Handbook, but in Ravnica, citizens refer to their money as zibs and zinos, with 100 zibs to 1 zino. There is no central mint, as coins are created by the Azorius, the Boros, and the Orzhov. The Ravnica Currency table summarizes the various guilds' coinage and its value.

#### RAVNICA CURRENCY

| Value Azorius |  | Boros | Orzhov |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 cp | copper zib |  | copper alms-coin |

|  |  |  | coin |
| 10 pp |  |  | platinum 100- |
|  |  |  | zino coin |

#### COMFORTS OF CIVILIZATION

A mixture of technological advancement and sophisticated magic offers amenities to the people of Ravnica that would be extraordinary to folk in most D&D worlds, except one like Eberron. The nicer neighborhoods of the city enjoy central heating and plumbing (thanks to the work of the Izzet League), elevators, and spacious apartments. Even poorer neighborhoods boast clean and smooth roads and sturdy construction. No one needs to go hungry in Ravnica, because the Golgari Swarm provides a bare minimum of sustenance to anyone who can't afford better food, though it is best not to think too much about where the thick gruel comes from. (In practical terms, even a character who can't afford more than a wretched lifestyle doesn't need to go hungry.)

The citizens of Ravnica enjoy plenty of leisure time, and the city offers an abundance of ways to fill it. Ravnica features restaurants with extensive collections of fine wines, cafés serving coffee and tea, street vendors offering portable meals, and bakeries that sell a wide variety of breads and pastries. Travelers can stay in luxury hotels or simple hostels, or they can rely on their personal or guild-related contacts to find housing. Diversions and entertainments abound, including raucous street-side theater (including the circus-like spectacles of the Cult of Rakdos), operas and symphonies, illegal fight clubs, sporting events held in vast arenas, throwaway popular novels, and great works of literature. These things are shared by the city's diverse peoples, who enjoy a life adorned by a variety of species, gender identities, and sexual orientations.

Well-established systems undergird society, largely through the efforts of the guilds. The Azorius Senate crafts, codifies, and enforces a comprehensive (some would say oppressive) set of laws. The banks of the Orzhov Syndicate offer secure vaults and complicated financial arrangements. The Izzet League maintains the city's infrastructure, and the Golgari Swarm ensures that waste is disposed of (or recycled). House Dimir couriers deliver messages and parcels across the city, and the Simic Combine addresses issues of public health.

Ravnica lacks any large-scale agriculture operations, its citizens depending on food produced in Selesnya gardens and underground Golgari rot farms. Few parts of Ravnica could be considered wilderness; the rubblebelts, areas where the city has decayed and been reclaimed by natural forces, are the only truly wild areas.

#### COSMOPOLITAN CONVENIENCES

| Item | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Cup of coffee | 10 cp |
| Newspaper | 15 cp |
| Pendulum clock | 100-250 gp |
| Spectacles | 25 gp |
| Spyglass | 50-100 gp |

#### LANGUAGES

Dozens of languages can be heard in any of Ravnica's marketplaces, and every tongue has dialects and regional variations. In order for the guilds to function, the Common language is essential. But other languages remain widely used in homes and clan gatherings.

#### STANDARD LANGUAGES

| Language | Typical Speakers | Script |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Abyssal | Demons, devils | Infernal |
| Celestial | Angels | Celestial |
| Common | Humans | Common |
| Draconic | Dragons | Draconic |
| Elvish | Elves | Elvish |
| Giant | Ogres, giants | Minotaur |
| Goblin | Goblins | Common |
| Kraul | Kraul | Kraul |
| Loxodon | Loxodons | Elvish |
| Merfolk | Merfolk | Merfolk |
| Minotaur | Minotaurs | Minotaur |
| Sphinx | Sphinxes |  |
| Sylvan | Centaurs, dryads | Elvish |
| Vedalken | Vedalken | Vedalken |

A few secret or exotic languages are used on Ravnica as well. Druidic exists and allows a secret communication among druids in different guilds, such as Selesnya and Golgari, but such communication is rare. Thieves' cant is widely used among street gangs and occasionally among rogues in House Dimir and the Golgari Swarm.

# CHAPTER 1: CHARACTER CREATION

HE PLAYER'S HANDBOOK DESCRIBES A STEPby-step process of character creation. When you create a character for a Ravnica campaign, you'll go through the same steps, with the added step of choosing a guild.

Creating a character begins with imagining the person you want to play. The ten guilds of Ravnica provide a way to jump-start your imagination and steer you toward certain character archetypes that can guide the rest of the decisions you make for your character.

# CHOOSING A GUILD

Chapter 2 describes the ten guilds of Ravnica in detail. How do you decide what guild you want your character to belong to? You can choose one of these approaches:

- · Look at the questionnaire, "What's Important to Me?", in this chapter. Let its questions and your choice of answers direct you to a guild that appeals to you or that sounds like a fun character to play.
- · Read the guild descriptions in chapter 2 and choose one that appeals to you.
- Read the descriptions of races and classes in this chapter. Guild membership recommendations are provided for each race and class, should one catch your eye.
- If you have access to MAGIC: THE GATHERING cards from a Ravnica set, find a card that appeals to you and build that character.
- . If you're a MAGIC player and you already have a favorite guild, create a character from that guild.

To reflect your character's membership in a guild, you can choose the background included in the guild's description instead of a background from the Player's Handbook or some other source. Also make a note of your contacts.

#### GUILDLESS CHARACTERS

You can play a character who isn't a member of a guild. Choose one of the character backgrounds in the Player's Handbook or another source instead of one of the guild backgrounds in chapter 2. Your guildless character can be of any class, race, and alignment. At the DM's option, you might have contacts within guilds, or the DM can invent contacts for you that aren't associated with the guilds of Ravnica in any way.

If you want your character to join a guild at a later time, the same guidelines apply as if the person were changing guilds, as described in chapter 2.

#### RACE AND CLASS

Each guild description in chapter 2 provides suggested races and classes for characters belonging to that guild. Some races have strong traditions that direct them toward certain guilds, but exceptions exist. If you choose a class or a race that's not typical for your guild, you might have trouble finding a role in the guild-or, more accurately, your superiors might have trouble figuring out what to do with you-but that challenge can be an interesting facet of your character's development. An atypical choice can also motivate your character to adventure independently from the guild.

This chapter describes new races you can choose from: centaurs, goblins, loxodons, minotaurs, Simic hybrids, and vedalken. It also presents two new subclass options: the cleric's Order Domain and the druid's Circle of Spores. Every subclass in the Player's Handbook also receives a mention in this chapter, indicating the guilds where characters of those subclasses might find a home.

Once you've chosen your race and class and recorded the benefits you get from them, you can proceed with the remaining steps of character creation as described in the Player's Handbook.

#### BUILDING A PARTY

It's possible to put together a diverse party of D&D characters drawn from a single guild. The guild descriptions in chapter 2 offer suggestions for what such a party might look like. Conversely, your party can include members of different guilds united by alliances or common principles. Or they could be childhood friends who ended up in different guilds, or just a haphazard collection of individuals thrown together by unforeseen circumstances. The Party Makeup table in this section offers suggestions for how you might compose your party.

The tables of contacts in chapter 2 can also help you create connections among the characters in your party. Those tables describe family relationships, current and former romantic connections, random acquaintances, past rivals, and many other ties that form among people in different guilds. Let these tables inspire you as you think about the circumstances that bring your party together.

Although conflicts among the guilds drive much of the action in a Ravnica campaign, it's important not to let that tension cause too much friction in a party of adventurers. The D&D game relies on cooperation among the players, so it's helpful for the player characters to find common ground that unites them despite their differences in guild affiliation, ideals, and agendas. Even though some guild leaders (especially the villainous ones) might talk about exterminating or dominating other guilds, many guild members have family, lovers, friends, and acquaintances among other guilds. Those positive associations can bind an adventuring party together.

The DM can also use the Common Cause table in this section to find a way to bring together characters who don't know or trust each other.

#### PARTY MAKEUP

# RACES

The people of Ravnica include members of many different races. Aside from humans, elves, and a smattering of half-elves, the races from the Player's Handbook are unknown on Ravnica, unless they're visiting from other worlds.

This chapter provides information about the following common races of Ravnica, as well as racial traits for all of them but humans and elves:

Humans on Ravnica are like those found on other D&D worlds: adaptable, ambitious, and wildly diverse. Elves, in their three common subraces, are strongly associated with nature.

- Centaurs, the quintessential merging of human and horse, savor freedom and champion nature's cause.
- Goblins are small, fierce, stealthy, and sometimes comical.
- Loxodons resemble humanoid elephants with powerful bodies, stoic natures, and serene wisdom.
- Minotaurs on Ravnica are sophisticated tacticians as well as strong and fierce warriors.
- Simic hybrids are the results of the Simic Combine's Guardian Project, which magically infuses the adaptive qualities of certain animal species into human, elf, or vedalken volunteers.
- Vedalken are tall, blue-skinned, and ingenious, with insatiable curiosity and a penchant for invention.

#### HEIGHT AND WEIGHT

You can roll for your character's height and weight on the Random Height and Weight table. See the Player's Handbook for humans, elves, and half-elves.

#### RANDOM HEIGHT AND WEIGHT

|  | Base | Height | Base | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Race | Height | Modifier | Weight | Modifier |
| Centaur | 6'0" | +1d10 | 600 IP. | × (2d12) lb. |
| Goblin | 3.5" | +2d4 | 35 Ib. | × 1 lb. |
| Simic |  |  | as humanoid base option - |  |
| hybrid |  |  |  |  |
| Loxodon | 6'7" | +2d10 | 295 lb. | × (2d4) lb. |

| Vedalken | 5'4" | +2d10 | 110 lb. | × (2d4) lb. |

Height = Base Height + Height Modifier in inches

Weight = (Base Weight + Height Modifier in pounds) x Weight Modifier

#### HUMAN

Humans are a scant majority among the peoples of Ravnica, dominating some guilds and barely represented in others. As on other worlds, they are innovators, achievers, and pioneers whose daring and adaptability make them capable of great things-and great falls.

Not one of the paruns of the ten guilds was human. although the Ghost Council of the Orzhov Syndicate is of human origin. Likewise, no current guildmaster is human. But humans are lieutenants, advisors, and strategists in many guilds. Their ambition and drive propel them toward the top, but the sheer might of beings such as ancient dragons, sphinxes, and demons keeps humans one rung down from the pinnacle of power.

The humans of Ravnica are no less physically diverse than those of other worlds. Similarly, they are varied in their inclinations: they alone are found in every guild.

#### HUMAN NAMES

One particular human tongue has triumphed over all others to become Ravnica's Common language, and its phonemes and traditions shape the names of most of Ravnica's humans. Humans sometimes borrow names from other races, but they have a rich pool of traditional names to draw from.

The use of family names seems to be a peculiarly human custom. Family names are passed down to children from either parent, and sometimes children use the family names of both their parents. For example, Micyl Savod Zunich was the son of Fonn Zunich and Jarad Vod Savo. When other races use family names, they are usually derived from some connection (not necessarily a blood tie) to a human family.

- Male Human Names: Agmand, Agosto, Bell, Brev, Dars, Dobromir, Dravin, Evern, Gorev, Ivos, Janik, Juri, Lannos, Lucian, Micas, Nikos, Obez, Olrik, Osidar, Rogad, Sergiu, Sirislav, Tibor, Trigori, Tzaric, Uzric, Valen, Vennick, Vict, Vorimir, Vuliev, Zunak
- Female Human Names: Anksa, Aszala, Berta, Bori, Briska, Dahlya, Geetra, Izolda, Jozica, Lavinia, Luda. Lyzolda, Milana, Miotri, Nefara, Palla, Pel, Ruba, Strava, Sulli, Vina, Voka, Zija
- Family Names: Andon, Bara, Bejiri, Borca, Capobar, Forenzad, Gerava, Gharti, Golozar, Gostok, Grezar, Helsk, Javya, Karlaus, Kirescu, Koba, Kos, Macav, Migellic, Nar, Nodov, Pelerine, Pijha, Ralinu, Ringor, Rokiric, Sarv, Shonn, Suszat, Tandris, Trul, Tylver, Valenco, Vay, Vinloskarga, Wenslauv, Yaszen

#### ELF

The elves of Ravnica are as much at home in the markets of Ivy Lane and the inns of Oak Street as their kin on other worlds are in ancient forests and fey castles. They scale the spires of cathedrals and meditate in gardens and greenbelts. They are part of the city, contributing to its vibrant life and sprawling growth while ensuring it never strays too far from its roots in the earth.

Elves are associated with the principles and magic of nature, growth, and stability. Striving to live in harmony with both nature and the community of Ravnica, they are drawn to guilds that share those ideals, particularly Selesnya, Golgari, and Simic. The Gruul Clans revere nature but set themselves in opposition to civilization, so they don't hold much appeal for the typical elf.

Ravnica's elves don't share the unearthly, haunting presence of their kin on other worlds, perhaps because of the extent to which the city has rubbed off on them. They can easily be mistaken for human from certain angles, particularly if their long, pointed ears and their delicate facial features aren't apparent.

#### ELF SUBRACES

As on other D&D worlds, Ravnica's elves can be categorized as high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, though there is little physical difference among the three subraces here. Elves share the traits described in the Player's Handbook for their race and subrace.

High Elves. The high elves of Ravnica have been subsumed into the Simic Combine and have lost their original tribal name. They are more slender than other

elves, and they tend to have angular features and pale skin that often verges toward greenish hues.

Wood Elves. The wood elves of Ravnica, called the Silhana, are strongly associated with the Selesnya Conclave. Most guildless elves can also trace their ancestry to the Silhana. Their coloration covers the whole human range, and sometimes extends to green- or copper-colored hair.

Dark Elves. The word "drow" isn't used on Ravnica, but the Devkarin elves are sometimes called the elves of shadow. They are closely connected to the Golgari Swarm, and because they generally live underground, they share other dark elves' sensitivity to sunlight. Unlike the drow of other worlds, their coloration is much the same as that of wood elves, though their hair is usually dark brown or black.

#### ELF NAMES

If the tradition of using child names for young elves, as described in the Player's Handbook, was ever practiced on Ravnica, it has long since died out. Some traditional Elvish names remain in use. often modified by the influence of human names. Most elves don't use family names.

Male Names: Alcarus, Aramin, Beryan, Carric, Ezoc, Gurras, Immeral, Jarad, Laucian, Mihas, Mandor, Molander, Peren, Suniel, Theren, Varis

Female Names: Arin, Bethrynna, Cevraya, Dainya, Drusilia, Elga, Emmara, Fonn, Ielenya, Iveta, Karissa, Kirce, Meriele, Nayine, Niszka, Svania, Veszka, Yeva

#### CENTAUR

In the sprawling city of Ravnica, where "open road" seems like a contradiction and "open plain" is sheer nonsense, centaurs nevertheless retain a love of wide spaces and the freedom to travel. As much as they can, centaurs run-in wide plazas, spacious parks, and expanses of rubble and ruin. They race the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming behind them, until the next wall looms in their path and brings them to a stop.

#### NATURE'S CAVALRY

Centaurs have the upper bodies, down to the waist, of muscular humans, displaying all the human variety of skin tones and features. Their ears are slightly pointed, but their faces are wider and squarer than those of elves. Below the waist, they have the bodies of small horses, with a similar range of coloration-from various shades of chestnut or bay to dappled or even zebra-like striped patterns. Most centaurs style their hair and their tails in a similar way. Selesnya centaurs favor long, flowing hair. Gruul centaurs cut their hair in rough, spiky styles.

The upper bodies of centaurs are comparable to human torsos in size, and their lower equine bodies average about 4 feet tall at the withers. Though they are smaller than a human rider mounted on a horse, they fill similar roles as cavalry warriors, messengers, outriders, and scouts.

#### AFFINITY FOR NATURE

Centaurs have an affinity for the natural world. Among the guilds that share that affinity, centaurs favor the rubblebelts of the Gruul Clans and the wide plazas of the Selesnya Conclave over the undercity tunnels of the Golgari and the laboratories of the Simic.

Centaurs celebrate life and growth, and the birth of a foal is always cause for festivities. At the same time, they revere the traditions of the past, and among both the Gruul and the Selesnya they are voices of memory and history, preserving old ways and keeping alive the legends of ancestral heroes. They feel a close kinship with wild animals, perhaps because of their own horselike bodies, and delight in the feeling of running alongside herds and packs of other beasts.

#### CLANS AND COMMUNITY

Centaurs sense the interconnectedness of the natural world. Thus, they celebrate family and community as microcosms of that greater connection. Among the Gruul, they have a strong clan identity, and Selesnya centaurs are fiercely loval to their individual communities as well as the guild as a whole. Their love of history and tradition also means that centaurs are more likely than most other Ravnicans to join the same guild that their parents did.

#### CENTAUR NAMES

Centaurs' given names are passed down through family lines. The name bestowed on a new foal is typically the name of the most recently deceased family member

of the same gender, keeping alive the memory-and, the centaurs believe, some shard of the spirit-of the departed. Centaurs don't use family names, but they wear symbols that represent their family membership. These symbols might include graphical representations of plants or animals, printed mottoes, braids and beads worn in the hair and tail, or even specific patterns of woven fabric.

Male Names: Bonmod, Boruvo, Chodi, Drozan, Kozim, Milosh, Ninos, Oleksi, Orval, Radovas, Radom, Rostis, Svetyos, Tomis, Trijiro, Volim, Vlodim, Yarog

Female Names: Daiva, Dunja, Elnaya, Galisnya, Irinya, Kotyali, Lalya, Litisia, Madya, Mira, Nedja, Nikya, Ostani, Pinya, Rada, Raisya, Stasolya, Tatna, Zhendoya, Zoria

#### CENTAUR TRAITS

Your centaur character has the following racial traits. These traits are also suitable for the centaurs of other worlds where there are centaurs of fey origin. These centaurs are smaller than the non-fey centaurs that roam in some realms.

Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

Age. Centaurs mature and age at about the same rate as humans.

Alignment. Centaurs are inclined toward neutrality. Those who join the Selesnya are more often neutral good, while those who join the Gruul are typically chaotic neutral.

Size. Centaurs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall. with their equine bodies reaching about 4 feet at the withers. Your size is Medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 40 feet.

Fey. Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid. Charge. If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a bonus action, making one attack against the target with your hooves.

Hooves. Your hooves are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

Equine Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.

In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

Survivor. You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, or Survival.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. Sylvan is widely spoken in the Selesnya Conclave, for it is rich in vocabulary to describe natural phenomena and spiritual forces.

#### GOBLIN

Whether sniveling in fear, cackling with mad laughter, or snarling in a fury, goblins are wretched and inconsequential-at least in the eyes of most of Ravnica's other folk. In their own minds, though, they are content to lurk in the shadows only until they fully come into their own and receive the recognition they believe they deserve. They are entitled to some credit for their tenacity, agility, crafty ingenuity, and dumb luck, all of which has enabled them to survive in a world overrun with creatures larger and more powerful than they are.

#### SMALL AND WIRY

Standing around 3 feet tall and covered in warty green or red skin, goblins have huge noses and ears. Their wiry bodies are surprisingly strong, and their mouths are full of sharp, crooked teeth.

Most goblins are bald, either by heredity or by choice, but a few boast shocks of red or black hair. Their arms and legs are elongated in proportion to their small bodies, and their fingers and toes are also long and slender. Many goblins prefer to go unshod to leave their toes exposed for climbing.

#### UNFETTERED EMOTION

Creatures of raw impulse, goblins are found among guilds that value that quality, particularly the Izzet (where they typically serve as attendants for researchers), the Gruul (in camps that form hapless buffers between the clans and civilized regions), the Rakdos (putting their love of explosions to good use), and occa-

sionally the Boros (if they discover a well of discipline and courage within themselves, or find themselves unable to resist the shininess of Boros weapons and armor). Many goblins are guildless and make their way as members of street gangs.

Sometimes driven by wild mood swings, goblins have an inclination toward destruction, which can take a playful form but is often anything but. Some goblins clobber things, others like to light them on fire, and many love to blow things up.

Goblins have an outrageous sense of humor, usually expressed through mischievous pranks. The malicious among them find pleasure in the misfortune of others and tend to cackle maniacally whenever they're amused. They can act with apparent randomness, sometimes just to confuse and befuddle others.

#### GOBLIN NAMES

The Goblin language is fond of certain sounds, and goblin names tend to repeat those sounds to form what can sound like nonsense words. A goblin's name gives no indication of gender.

Goblin Names: Azzinax, Babolax, Blixanix, Crixizix, Dazzaz, Estrix, Finizix, Juzba, Kaluzax, Lyzaxa. Mizzix, Myznar, Nixispix, Paxizaz, Ravixiz, Stixil, Sunnix, Tozinox, Uxivozi, Vazozav, Wexiny, Zizzix

#### GOBLIN TRAITS

Your goblin character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score

increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

Age. Goblins reach adulthood around age 8. They age noticeably faster than humans, and though few goblins live to old age, the most cautious rarely live longer than 60 years.

Alignment. Most of the goblins of Ravnica are chaotic, with no inclination toward good or evil.

Size. Goblins are between 3 and 4 feet tall and weigh between 40 and 80 pounds. Your size is Small.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Fury of the Small. When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than vours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Nimble Escape. You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin. In Ravnica, Goblin is a simplistic language with a limited vocabulary and fluid rules of grammar, unsuited for any sophisticated conversation.

#### LOXODON

The humanoid elephants called loxodons are often oases of calm in the busy streets of Ravnica. They hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or

sit in perfect stillness. If provoked to action, loxodons are true terrors-bellowing with rage, trumpeting and flapping their ears. Their serene wisdom, fierce loyalty, and unwavering conviction are tremendous assets to their guilds.

#### LUMBERING GIANTS

Loxodons tower above most other humanoids, standing over 7 feet tall. They have the heads-trunks, tusks, ears, and faces-of elephants, and hulking bipedal bodies covered by thick, leathery skin. Each of their hands has four thick digits, and their feet are the flat-bottomed, oval-shaped feet of elephants.

Like that of an elephant, a loxodon's trunk is a useful appendage. In addition to providing a keen sense of smell, the trunk can be used to lift and carry even heavy objects. The trunk can be used to carry both food and liquid to the mouth and can even act as a snorkel.

#### GIFTED STONEWORKERS

Loxodons are tireless, patient artisans with an unrivaled intuition about their craft. Although they make nurturing spiritual leaders, their gift for stonework is so ingrained that they are often at a loss when they try to impart that knowledge to others. Among the Selesnya, it primarily falls to loxodons to build the guild's magnificent, cathedral-like arboretum structures.

#### RELENTLESSLY LOYAL

Loxodons believe in the value of community and life, and thus are most often found in the Selesnya Conclave. Some find fulfillment in the cause of order by joining the Orzhov Syndicate or the Azorius Senate.

Loxodons believe that the members of a group have a responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any capacity, loxodons devote themselves to maintaining that bond. They coordinate their efforts and are often willing

to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the group. They expect reciprocal loyalty and commitment from the other members of their communities and can be severe in their disappointment when their trust is betrayed.

The primary difference between loxodons who join different guilds is their sense of the size of the community they belong to. For loxodons in the Selesnya Conclave, their community is the world and all living beings in it-everything valuable, meant to live in harmony, and interdependent. For Azorius loxodons, community primarily means a society of different peoples who need adherence to law and order so they can function together. For those in the Orzhov Syndicate, community means the syndicate alone, with its interests taking priority over those of any other group.

#### LOXODON NAMES

A loxodon's name includes subtle tones, produced in a loxodon's resonant nasal chambers, that indicate status, family connection, and community role. Since most non-loxodons can't distinguish these underlying tones, let alone produce them, loxodons often translate them into titles, such as Hierarch, Revered, Grandmother, Healer, or Saint, when interacting with other races.

Male Names: Bayul, Berov, Brooj, Chedumov, Dobrun, Droozh, Golomov, Heruj, Ilromov, Kel, Nikoom, Ondros, Radomov, Svetel, Tamuj, Throom, Vasool

Female Names: Ajj, Boja, Dancu, Dooja, Elyuja, Fanoor, Irij, Jasoo, Katrun, Lyooda, Mayja, Radu, Shuja, Soofya, Totoor, Verij, Vesmova, Yoolna, Zarij, Zoorja

#### LOXODON TRAITS

Your loxodon character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score in-

creases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Loxodons physically mature at the same rate

as humans, but they live about 450 years. They highly value the weight of wisdom and experience and are considered young until they reach the age of 60.

Alignment. Most loxodons are lawful, believing in the value of a peaceful, ordered life. They also tend toward good.

Size. Loxodons stand between 7 and 8 feet tall. Their massive bodies weigh between 300 and 400 pounds. Your size is Medium.

Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Loxodon Serenity. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

Natural Armor. You have thick, leathery skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to

#### RULE TIP: AC CALCULATIONS DON'T STACK

When the game gives you more than one way to calculate your Armor Class, you can use only one of them. You choose the one to use. For example, if you have the loxodon's Natural Armor trait and the monk's Unarmored Defense feature, you don't mix them together. Instead, you choose which one determines your AC.

determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

Trunk. You can grasp things with your trunk, and you can use it as a snorkel. It has a reach of 5 feet, and it can lift a number of pounds equal to five times your Strength score. You can use it to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature: open or close a door or a container; grapple someone: or make an unarmed strike. Your DM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options.

Your trunk can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell.

Keen Smell. Thanks to your sensitive trunk, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception). Wisdom (Survival), and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that involve smell.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Loxodon.

#### MINOTAUR

The minotaurs of Ravnica are strong in body, dedication, and courage. They are at home on the battlefield, willing to fight for their various causes. They combine a burning fury in battle with keen tactics that make them excellent commanders as well as valuable shock troops.

#### HORNS AND HOOVES

Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. They often ornament their horns with metal rings or sheathe them in metal to protect them from damage.

Manes of shaggy fur extend down minotaurs' necks and powerful backs, and males have long tufts of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves. Minotaurs are born with long, tufted tails, but minotaurs of the Ordruun clan (and some others) have their tails docked as part of a coming-of-age ceremony: they find the heavy armor of the Boros legion much more comfortable without a long tail in the way.

#### STRENGTH AND ZEAL

Minotaurs are zealous and love battle. They are found among the Gruul Clans, but the minotaurs of the Ordruun family line, long associated with the Boros Legion, are much better known and respected. Boros minotaurs choose the precision of the legion over the fury of the pack.

Minotaurs tend to vent their outrage through violence, but they aren't generally quick to anger. They are passionate, loving their friends and partners fiercely, and they laugh loud and long at good jokes.

#### FAMILY AND GUILD

Minotaur legends describe a small pantheon of heroesperhaps they were once thought of as gods-who established the minotaurs' place in the world. Every minotaur in Ravnica claims descent from one of these heroes.

The Ordruun line is the most prominent, with thousands of members descended from an ancient hero who is said to have taught minotaurs the arts of war. Other important family lines include the Kharran line (primarily associated with the Gruul Scab clan), the Drendaa line (found scattered among the Gruul Clans), and the Tazgral line (divided between the Boros and the Gruul, with a significant number in the Rakdos as well).

Since each family line has so many members, minotaurs don't usually find it helpful to connect the name of the line to their personal names; even though Commander Grozdan of the Boros Legion's Kamen Fortress is a prominent member of the Ordruun line, he would never call himself Grozdan Ordruun the way a human would.

#### MINOTAUR NAMES

The legends that recount the deeds of ancient minotaur heroes are full of other names as well: those of the retainers, allies, lovers, servants, enemies, and others who played roles, however small, in the lives of the heroes. Almost every minotaur name is drawn from that long list of minor characters of legend, so that those folk are never forgotten.

- Male Names: Alovnek, Brogmir, Brozhdar, Dornik, Drakmir, Drazhan, Grozdan, Kalazmir, Klattic, Melislek, Nirikov, Prezhlek, Radolak, Rugilar, Sarovnek, Svarakov, Trovik, Vraslak, Yarvem
- Female Names: Akra, Bolsa, Cica, Dakka, Drakisla, Eleska, Enka, Irnaya, Jaska, Kalka, Makla, Noraka, Pesha, Raisha, Sokali, Takyat, Vrokya, Veska, Yelka, Zarka, Zoka

#### MINOTAUR TRAITS

Your minotaur character has the following racial traits. These traits are also suitable for minotaurs in other D&D worlds where these people have avoided the demonic influence of Baphomet.

Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

Alignment. Most minotaurs who join the Boros Legion lean toward lawful alignments, while

those associated with the Cult of Rakdos or the Gruul Clans tend toward chaotic alignments.

Size. Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and they have stocky builds. Your size is Medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Horns. Your horns are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

Goring Rush. Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action.

Hammering Horns. Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove that target with your horns. The target must be no more than one size larger than you and within 5 feet of vou. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, you push it up to 10 feet away from you.

Imposing Presence. You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Intimidation or Persuasion.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur.

### SIMIC HYBRID

The Simic Combine uses magic to fuse different life forms together. In recent years, the Simic Combine has extended this research to humanoid subjects, magically transferring the traits of various animals into humans. elves, and vedalken. The goal of the Guardian Project is to build a Simic army of soldiers perfectly adapted to a variety of combat situations. These hyper-evolved specimens are called Simic hybrids, though they sometimes refer to themselves as guardians.

#### EXTENSIVE ADAPTATION

A hybrid's biological enhancements can change its appearance drastically, though most hybrids retain their basic physical form. All are augmented with characteristics of animals, mostly aquatic, reptilian, or amphibian creatures. These include crab claws, squid tentacles, wings or fins like those of manta rays, translucent or camouflaged skin, or shark-like maws filled with sharp teeth.

Hybrids are the product of Simic magic. It's not impossible for a hybrid to leave the Simic Combine and join another guild, but the Simic would consider the individual a deserter. And the new guild might never fully welcome a hybrid who could easily be a Simic spy.

#### SIMIC HYBRID NAMES

A hybrid usually bears the name given by their human, elf, or vedalken parents. Some hybrids assume a new name after their transformation-a name chosen personally or by those who transformed them.

#### SIMIC HYBRID TRAITS

Your hybrid character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score in-

creases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

Age. Hybrids begin their lives as adult humans, elves, or vedalken. They age at a slightly accelerated rate, so their maximum life spans are probably reduced somewhat. The Guardian Project has not been operating long enough to observe the full effect of this phenomenon.

Alignment. Most hybrids share the generally neutral outlook of the Simic Combine. They are more interested in scientific research and the standing of their guild than in moral or ethical questions. Those who leave the Combine, however, often do so because their philosophical outlook and alignment are more in line with a different guild's.

Size. Your size is Medium, within the normal range of your humanoid base race.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and your choice of Elvish or Vedalken.

Animal Enhancement. Your body has been altered to incorporate certain animal characteristics. You choose one animal enhancement now and a second enhancement at 5th level.

At 1st level, choose one of the following options:

- Manta Glide. You have ray-like fins that you can use as wings to slow your fall or allow you to glide. When you fall and aren't incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage, and you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend.
- Nimble Climber. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
- Underwater Adaptation. You can breathe air and water, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

At 5th level, your body evolves further, developing new characteristics. Choose one of the options you didn't take at 1st level, or one of the following options:

- Grappling Appendages. You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. As an action, you can use one of them to try to grapple a creature. Each one is also a natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These appendages can't precisely manipulate anything and can't wield weapons, magic items, or other specialized equipment.
- Carapace. Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you're not wearing heavy armor.

- Acid Spit. As an action, you can spray acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Consitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
#### VEDALKEN

Nothing is perfect. Vedalken not only believe this fact, they rejoice in it. Every imperfection is a chance for improvement, and progress is an endless march toward a state of perfection that can never be reached. This viewpoint leads vedalken to pursue their work with delighted enthusiasm, never deterred by setbacks and excited by every opportunity for improvement.

Vedalken are tall and slender, standing almost a head taller than humans on average but weighing about the same. Their hairless skin comes in a range of shades of blue. Their eyes are darker shades of blue or violet. They lack external ears, their noses are broad and flat, and they are partially amphibious.

#### COOL RATIONALITY

Despite being talkative, vedalken keep their personal lives private, and they tend to engage more with ideas than with people. They form close friendships based on mutual interests or compelling disagreements, and their interactions dwell on their thoughts about those issues rather than their feelings about them.

To members of other races, vedalken often seem cold, even emotionless. That assessment isn't fair-they feel emotion every bit as intensely as other folk do, but they are skilled at not displaying it. Cool rationality guides their actions, they make and follow careful plans, and they are patient enough to do nothing when the ideal outcome relies on such inaction.

#### REASONING TOWARD PERFECTION

Their curious intellects and rational minds incline vedalken toward membership in the Azorius Senate, the Simic Combine, and (less often) the Izzet League. Whatever their guild affiliation, they put their intelligence to use in crafting and improving things, whether those things are laws, procedures, or magical sciences.

Vedalken believe that the path toward the impossible goal of perfection is paved with bricks of education, . careful deliberation, and controlled experimentation. Some vedalken direct their energy toward perfecting themselves, whether by means of Simic bioengineering or through extensive study, and others concentrate on perfecting society through the careful drafting and application of laws.

#### VEDALKEN NAMES

Vedalken are given names at birth, but usually choose new names for themselves as part of their transition into adulthood. They rarely use family names.

Male Names: Aglar, Bellin, Dallid, Firellan, Kavin, Koplony, Lomar, Mathvan, Modar, Nebun, Nhillosh, Nitt, Otrovac, Ovlan, Pelener, Rill, Trivaz, Uldin, Yolov, Zataz

Female Names: Azi, Barvisa, Brazia, Direll, Fainn, Griya, Hallia, Katrille, Kovel, Lilla, Mirela, Morai, Nedress, Ossya, Pierenn, Roya, Sestri, Triel, Uzana, Yaraghiya, Zlovol

#### VEDALKEN TRAITS

Your vedalken character has the following racial traits. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score in-

creases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Vedalken mature slower than humans do, reach-

ing maturity around age 40. Their life span is typically 350 years, with some living to the age of 500.

Alignment. Vedalken are usually lawful and non-evil. Size. Tall and slender, Vedalken stand 6 to 61/2 feet tall on average and usually weigh less than 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Vedalken Dispassion. You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

Tireless Precision. You are proficient in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Performance, or Sleight of Hand. You are also proficient with one tool of your choice.

Whenever you make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check's total.

Partially Amphibious. By absorbing oxygen through your skin, you can breathe underwater for up to 1 hour. Once you've reached that limit, you can't use this trait again until you finish a long rest.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Vedalken, and one other language of your choice.

# CLASSES BY GUILD

Your character can have any class that appears in the Player's Handbook (or other sources, with your DM's permission). Certain classes and subclasses are especially appropriate for particular guilds, reflecting the traditions and training of those guilds. This section can help you choose a guild if you already know what class you want to play.

### BARBARIAN

If you want to play a barbarian, your most likely guild home is the Gruul Clans, but you could also put your rage to work in the wild spectacles of the Cult of Rakdos.

Gruul barbarians of the Zhur-Taa clan often choose the path of the Totem Warrior and a boar totem spirit. The effects are the same as for a bear spirit.

#### BARBARIAN

#### CLERIC

Though the worship of gods isn't widespread in Ravnica, clerics dedicated to more abstract principles do exist, primarily within the Azorius Senate, the Boros Legion, the Gruul Clans, the Orzhov Syndicate, and the Selesnya Conclave. They most often use their guild insignia as holy symbols.

### DRUID

Druid characters are typically associated with the Golgari Swarm, the Gruul Clans, the Selesnya Conclave, and the Simic Combine. Druid circles do not cross guild boundaries; the fact that a Golgari druid and a Selesnya druid both belong to the Circle of the Land does not necessarily create common ground between them.

#### FIGHTER

Fighters are common in almost every guild, with Dimir as the notable exception. In a world where constant tension among the guilds often blooms into physical violence, fighters are the core of most guilds' defenses.

#### FIGHTER

#### MONK

Unarmed fighting styles like those practiced by monks are uncommon on Ravnica, but a few guilds-House Dimir, the Selesnya Conclave, and the Simic Combine-do have contemplative traditions that include channeling magic in the form of ki.

#### PALADIN

The loyalty of a paladin is appreciated most by those guilds that value oaths of service, namely the Azorius Senate, the Boros Legion, and the Selesnya Conclave.

#### PALADIN

#### RANGER

Standing as a bastion between civilization and the wilderness, Boros rangers scout the rubblebelts and other wild areas of Ravnica. Gruul rangers serve a similar role, though they are focused on protecting their clans from the encroachment of civilized forces such as the Boros. Selesnya and Golgari rangers are focused on protecting their communities.

#### SORCERER

Ravnica's sorcerers usually attribute their magical power not to bloodlines or cosmic forces, but to laboratory experiments-often ones gone awry. Thus, they are most often found among the Izzet.

Niv-Mizzet, the guildmaster of the Izzet, is a dragon. Sorcerers who gain their elemental powers from laboratory incidents often claim that they have been infused with some of Niv-Mizzet's power.

#### WARLOCK

In a handful of guilds, service to a powerful individual is common among warlocks. Warlocks are most often found in the Cult of Rakdos and the Selesnya Conclave.

Members of any guild who delve too deeply into forbidden secrets-perhaps at the behest of their guilds' leaders, or sometimes in defiance of them-might unearth lore regarding the "old gods" of Ravnica. These mysterious beings, called the Nephilim, grant warlocks the mysterious and maddening powers of the Great Old One.

### SUBCLASS OPTIONS

Two classes receive subclass options in this section: the cleric and the druid.

At 1st level, a cleric chooses a Divine Domain. This book adds the Order Domain to the options available to the cleric making that choice.

At 2nd level, a druid chooses a Druid Circle. This book adds the Circle of Spores to the options available to the druid making that choice.

#### CLERIC: ORDER DOMAIN

The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to a society or an institution and strict obedience to the laws governing it. On Ravnica, the domain is favored by clerics of the Azorius Senate, who use it to maintain and enforce the law, and of the Orzhov Syndicate, who exploit law and order for their personal gain. On other worlds, gods who grant access to this domain include Bane, Tyr, Majere, Erathis, Pholtus, Wee Jas, Aureon, Maglubiyet, Nuada, Athena, Anubis, Forseti, and Asmodeus.

The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an action's results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.

Law establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability. In this manner, law creates an intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge order and security in a chaotic multiverse.

#### ORDER DOMAIN FEATURES

| Cleric Level | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | Domain Spells, Bonus Proficiencies, Voice of Authority |
| 2nd | Channel Divinity: Order's Demand |
| 6th | Embodiment of the Law |
| 8th | Divine Strike |
| 17th | Order's Wrath |

#### DOMAIN SPELLS

You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Order Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature in the Player's Handbook for how domain spells work.

#### ORDER DOMAIN SPELLS

| Cleric Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | command, heroism |
| 3rd | hold person, zone of truth |
| 5th | mass healing word, slow |
| 7th | compulsion, locate creature |
| 9th | commune, dominate person |

#### BONUS PROFICIENCIES

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. You also gain proficiency in the Intimidation or Persuasion skill (your choice).

#### VOICE OF AUTHORITY

Starting at 1st level, you can invoke the power of law to drive an ally to attack. If you cast a spell with a spell slot of 1st level or higher and target an ally with the spell, that ally can use their reaction immediately after the spell to make one weapon attack against a creature of your choice that you can see.

If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.

#### CHANNEL DIVINITY: ORDER'S DEMAND

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to exert an intimidating presence over others.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn or until the charmed creature takes any damage. You can also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.

#### EMBODIMENT OF THE LAW

At 6th level, you become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others.

If you cast a spell of the enchantment school using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can change the spell's casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting, provided the spell's casting time is normally 1 action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### DIVINE STRIKE

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### ORDER'S WRATH

Starting at 17th level, enemies you designate for destruction wilt under the combined efforts of you and your allies. If you deal your Divine Strike damage to a creature on your turn, you can curse that creature until the start of your next turn. The next time one of your allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the target also takes 2d8 psychic damage, and the curse ends. You can curse a creature in this way only once per turn.

### DRUID: CIRCLE OF SPORES

Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life.

These druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.

Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. Unlike most other druids, they see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.

#### CIRCLE OF SPORES FEATURES

| CAMPLE PARTY COLL THE CAST PARTIC CASTING CON Druid Level | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| 2nd | Circle Spells, Halo of Spores, |
|  | Symbiotic Entity |
| 6th | Fungal Infestation |
| 10th | Spreading Spores |
| 14th | Fungal Body |

#### CIRCLE SPELLS

Your symbiotic link to fungus and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the chill touch cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

#### CIRCLE OF SPORES SPELLS

| Druid Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | blindness/deafness, gentle repose |
| 5th | animate dead, gaseous form |
| 7th | blight, confusion |
| 9th | cloudkill, contagion |

#### HALO OF SPORES

Starting at 2nd level, you are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

#### SYMBIOTIC ENTITY

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

- · When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
- · Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 poison damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

#### RULE TIP: TEMPORARY HIT POINTS DON'T STACK

If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them. you don't add them together, unless a rule says you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep. For more information on temporary hit points, see chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook.

#### FUNGAL INFESTATION

At 6th level, your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to vour Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### SPREADING SPORES

At 10th level, you gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 30 feet away, where they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no longer active.

Whenever a creature moves into the cube or starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn.

While the cube of spores persists, you can't use your Halo of Spores reaction.

#### FUNGAL BODY

At 14th level, the fungal spores in your body alter you: you can't be blinded, deafened, frightened, or poisoned, and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead, unless you're incapacitated.

# CHAPTER 2: GUILDS OF RAVNICA

HE TEN GUILDS ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF Ravnica, making up the foundation of its society. They are voluntary associations led by guildmasters, but that's the extent of their resemblance to the craft and merchant guilds found on most DUNGEONS & DRAGONS worlds. They include many different kinds of organizations:

- · A government body, the Azorius Senate
- · A military force, the Boros Legion
- · An espionage network, House Dimir
- · An association of raiders, the Gruul Clans
- · Two scientific research institutions, the Izzet League and the Simic Combine
- · An organized crime family, the Orzhov Syndicate
- · Raucous performance troupes collectively known as the Cult of Rakdos, which bends to the whims of a powerful demon
- Two widely divergent groups devoted to nature, the Golgari Swarm and the Selesnya Conclave

Citizens of Ravnica aren't born into guilds. An individual can choose to belong to any guild-or no guild. Some guilds, such as Selesnya and Boros, actively recruit new members, while others simply accept those who seek membership. People within a family might join different guilds, which can lead to strong connections between the guilds in question or to painful animosity in families whose members follow different paths.

Even though citizens can choose their guild associations, long-standing traditions steer certain individuals toward a particular guild. For example, it would be highly unusual for a Devkarin elf (a dark elf) to join any guild other than the Golgari, and the Ordruun line of minotaurs has provided the Boros armies with generations of offspring. Members of certain races are also drawn to specific guilds, as noted in the description of each of guild.

# GUILD MEMBERSHIP

You establish your character's membership in a guild by choosing that guild's background from among those detailed in this chapter. This book assumes that you have chosen a guild and that you maintain your association with it throughout your life. As a result, your choice of guild can play a more significant role than most backgrounds do in shaping what your character does now, not just what you accomplished in the past.

The backgrounds associated with guilds in this chapter work like those in the Player's Handbook, giving you proficiencies, languages, equipment, and suggested characteristics (personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws). Each guild entry also provides personal contacts; suggestions for your alignment, race, and class; and a list of spells that you can add to your spell list if you're a member of a spellcasting class.

### GUILD SPELLS

The spellcasters of Ravnica's guilds have a style of magic specific to their guild. A guild's description includes a list of guild spells that epitomize the type of magic the guild favors. The Boros Legion, for example, tends to prefer using spells of fire magic and holy light, and its guild spell list reflects that emphasis.

If you play a character who has the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, your guild spells are added to the spell list for your class, thereby expanding the spell options available to you.

#### BONDS AND CONTACTS

As a benefit of your guild membership, you have contacts both inside and outside the guild. Contacts are useful resources in the urban environment of Ravnica, where a friendly face can be more valuable than gold.

As stated in the Player's Handbook, bonds represent your connections to people, places, and events in the world. Contacts are people you have a connection to, but they're not necessarily bonds. People can be bonds if they inspire you, motivate you, or make you act against your best interests. (They can represent flaws if their existence amounts to a weakness for you.) Contacts, in comparison, are simply people you know. They might be

#### THE GUILDLESS

The guilds might be considered the heart and soul of Ravnica, but they aren't all that makes up the city. Many citizens choose not to join a guild-some because they can't be bothered, and others because they have philosophical objections to the very idea of guilds. The so-called guildless are especially common in areas that might be considered rural: places farther from the heart of the city and the larger exurban districts. But even in the city's heart, some guildless citizens actively oppose the influence of the guilds, blaming the world's strife and suffering on an elite hierarchy that seeks to take control, consolidate wealth, and fragment a populace against itself.

The numbers of the guildless include people engaged in a wide variety of trades and services that aren't managed and regulated by the guilds, from baking to cartography. University professors, guides, traders, and bartenders might be guildless. Criminal gangs set themselves up as rivals to the Orzhov, and even military forces operate independent of guild control, serving as neighborhood police forces or mercenaries for hire.

About half of Ravnica's population is guildless. That proportion is higher for some races than others: nearly all elves, for example, belong to the Golgari, Selesnya, or Simic guilds, but a majority of goblins are guildless. Loxodons tend to have a strong sense of community, so they readily join guilds. And when they don't, they join groups of another sort, such as mercenary companies or cults. Simic hybrids are all created within the Simic Combine, so it's rare for them not to be part of it.

friends, rivals, or even family members, but their relationship with you is rarely as strong as with a bond.

Although the tables of contacts in this chapter describe nonplayer characters who are members of guilds (your own and others), you are likely to acquire guildless contacts as well. NPCs such as goblin gang leaders, minotaur bartenders, and vedalken tailors all go about their lives in the shadow of the guilds but divorced from those groups' intrigue and politics.

#### STARTING CONTACTS

Your character starts the game with three contacts: an ally in their guild, a rival in their guild, and an ally or rival in another guild. (House Dimir is an exception.) Tables in each guild section help you determine who these contacts are-facts that you can build on by working with your DM to add some details. The table entries for contacts are written in the first person, where "I" is your character.

You'll roll twice on the Contacts table for your guild, unless you're in House Dimir (as explained in that guild's section). Your first roll gives you an ally. Your second roll gives you a rival, who might be friendly, jealous, or antagonistic. (It's possible for these to be the same person; a single person might be generally friendly toward you and simultaneously jealous of your success, for example.) Then you'll roll once on the table of contacts from other guilds. That contact could be either an ally or a rival, or you might instead gain a third contact from your own guild.

#### RENOWN

As you advance the goals of your guild through your adventures, you become an increasingly important part of the guild's activities. You might rise through the ranks, eventually taking up a position at the right hand of the guildmaster-or even becoming the master yourself!

Your status in your guild is measured by your renown score. As you increase that score, you gain the opportunity to advance in the ranks of the guild.

When you join a guild as a starting character, your renown score with that guild is 1. Your renown score increases by 1 when you do something to advance the guild's interests, assuming that other members of the guild are aware of what you've done. Each guild's description in this chapter includes a discussion of its goals and your role in pursuing those goals, which your DM will use to judge whether you earn an increase in your renown score.

The various ranks within the guilds describe the range of tasks you might perform, from testing experimental Izzet weaponry to leading a squad of Boros soldiers into battle. When you're assigned a mission that involves an adventure-leaving behind your guild holdings and putting yourself in danger-and you complete that mission, your renown score with that guild increases by 2. Chapter 4 includes information for the DM about missions appropriate for your guild.

Other tasks that don't involve adventuring can also improve your renown score. You can use the time between adventures to improve your renown within your guild by performing these tasks, as well as by socializing with

prominent people in the guild. After doing so for a total number of days equal to your current renown score multiplied by 10, your renown score increases by 1.

At your DM's discretion, you might also have a renown score in a guild you don't belong to. You can't ever formally advance in rank within another guild, but a high renown score can earn you additional contacts, favors, and other benefits. This option can be useful in an intrigue-heavy campaign where the adventurers spend a lot of time trying to influence the leaders of various guilds.

#### BENEFITS OF RENOWN

As you gain renown in a guild, you gain certain benefits. Most benefits are guild-specific, but there are general benefits that apply no matter which guild you belong to:

- Renown 3 or Higher. When you have a renown score of at least 3 with your own guild, you are an established and respected member of the guild. Other members of the guild have a friendly attitude toward you by default. (Individual members of the guild might have reasons to dislike you despite your renown.) They provide you with lodging and food in dire circumstances and pay for your funeral if needed. If you are accused of a crime, your guild offers legal support, as long as a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime was justifiable.
- Renown 5 or Higher. When your renown score with any guild reaches 5, you gain an additional contact within the guild. This contact might be a character you met during your adventures or someone who seeks you out because of your fame. Your DM will assign you a contact or have you roll on the Contacts table for the appropriate guild.

Some guilds-notably Azorius, Orzhov, and Boroshave well-defined hierarchies that characters can ascend through as they improve their renown scores.

2

Other guilds have positions of honor that characters can apply for if their renown score is high enough. Not every member of the Selesnya Conclave aspires to be a sagittar (an archer assigned to guard an important guild location), but any character who meets the prerequisites can apply for the position. Ultimately, the DM decides whether a character qualifies for such a role, with a certain renown score as a minimum requirement.

Several guilds provide a salary among the benefits of renown within the guild. The salary is described as sufficient to maintain a lifestyle of a certain level. If you earn a salary, you can live at the specified lifestyle without paying the normal daily expenditure. See chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook for more information on lifestyle expenses.

A prominent position in a guild often allows you to call on the services of lower-ranking members to assist you in your work. When you do, they are assumed to be loyal followers who help you to the best of their ability. Some of them are assigned to help you for the duration of a single task or mission, while others are under your permanent command, staffing a laboratory, workshop, or garrison where you are in charge. Depending on their role, they might help you in dangerous situations (like

combat) or flee from them. You might assign them to perform tasks in your absence, which could include undertaking research, looking for witnesses to a crime, or carrying out a small-scale raid, for example, depending on their role and capabilities. You carry the responsibility for their lives and welfare, ultimately, and if the guild decides that you are abusing your authority and mistreating the members beneath you, you might lose renown, lose your rank or status in the guild, or even be cast out of the guild.

#### LOSING RENOWN

If you commit a serious offense against your guild or its members, you might lose renown within the guild. The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is left to the DM's discretion. A character's renown score with a guild can never drop below 0. If your renown score drops below the threshold for a rank or privilege you have attained, you lose that benefit. Even if you regain the lost renown, you might find it more difficult to again secure a position or rank you have previously lost.

#### STYLES OF MEMBERSHIP

As you're playing a character associated with one of the guilds, think about your character's relationship with the guild. Guild members can be grouped into four categories, depending on their motivations and priorities: loyalists, opportunists, rebels, and anomalies. Which one of these descriptions best fits your character?

Loyalists join a guild because they firmly believe in the guild's ideals and want to advance its goals. Their membership in the guild is a badge of identity for them. They're typically of the races and classes most strongly associated with the guild, and their personality traits and ideals fall in line with the suggestions in this chapter. An idealistic human or a minotaur paladin in the Boros Legion is an example of a loyalist.

Opportunists join a guild based on what they can gain from becoming members. Every guild offers its members something-whether concrete benefits such as opportunities for wealth or more subtle, intangible rewards such as social status-and getting that something is the primary motivation for this type of character. Opportunists often pay lip service to the ideals and goals of the guild, looking out for themselves first and the guild second (at best). A selfish human fighter who uses membership in the Boros Legion as an excuse to bully and steal from others would be an opportunist.

Rebels love the guilds they're in but don't conform to guild expectations. They might be good-hearted idealists trying to bend a shady guild toward nobler pursuits, or they might be selfish egotists hoping to direct the guild's actions toward promoting their own interests. Most rebels are typical members of the guild in terms of race and class, but they vary from type when it comes to personalities and ideals. A Boros legionnaire with tyrannical tendencies who thinks the Boros should enforce justice with an iron fist would be a rebel.

Anomalies are individuals who join guilds contrary to all expectations. Their race or class (or both) is outside the norm for their guild, but their personalities and ideals fall perfectly in line; that's why they joined.

A vedalken paladin in the Boros Legion, or an Ordruun minotaur in the Orzhov Syndicate, would fall into this category.

#### MEMBERSHIP AND INDEPENDENCE

Some adventurers do exactly what they're told, spending their careers doing the bidding of their guild superiors. Most adventuring characters, though, prefer more independence. You can roll a d6 or choose from the options in the table below to establish a reason for the freedom enjoyed by your character.

#### Reason for Independence qe

- l I've been around long enough that my guild lets me do what I want.
- I've been chosen for special assignments because I'm 2 just that good.
- I've been singled out for special assignments because 3 somebody up the ranks hates me.
- I'm moonlighting, and I'd get in trouble if my 4 superiors knew what I was up to.
- I've been put at the disposal of another guild because 5 my superiors want to help them.
- I've been put at the disposal of another guild because 6 my superiors hope I'll fail.

#### CHANGING GUILDS

If events in your character's adventuring career warrant it, you can abandon membership in one guild and join a different one. Once you leave a guild, you can rarely go back.

Your DM decides what requirements you must meet to join a new guild. Some guilds welcome new recruits and make the process as simple as possible, while others require a demonstration of loyalty.

When you change guilds, you lose all the privileges of membership in your original guild, including the background feature granted to you by your original guild and any rank or position you have achieved in that guild. You also lose access to your old guild spells, unless they are already on your class's spell list, among your spells known, or in your spellbook. Except in exceptional circumstances, your renown score with your original guild becomes 0.

Your old guild expects you to return your guild insignia, and your new guild gives you one to replace it.

You gain the privileges of membership in your new guild. These include the background feature granted by your new guild, although your DM might decide that it takes you a while to gain the full benefit. For example, a character who leaves another guild to join the Gruul Clans doesn't immediately know the ways of the rubblebelts, but has to gain that familiarity over time. You also gain access to your new guild spells.

Your new guild doesn't give you any benefits that assume prior knowledge or experience, including proficiencies, starting equipment (except your guild insignia), and contacts.

# AZORIUS SENATE

OFFICER LAVINIA STOOD BEFORE THE ENORMOUS double doors that led into the highest spire of New Prahv, the lair of the guildmaster. To look at her, nothing would seem out of place: her cape spilled elegantly from her officer's armor, her sword shone like a decorative piece one would hang above a mantel, and her three-sided medals displayed her district-spanning rank.

-Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

Bringing order from chaos-that is the mission of the Azorius Senate. Without the extensive legal code crafted and enforced by the Azorius, society would crumble, transforming Ravnica into a field of rubble where the Gruul and the Rakdos do whatever they please. The Azorius carry this weighty responsibility with stoic pride, and they perform their work of legislation, investigation, and enforcement with steely determination.

The first guildmaster of the Azorius Senate was a sphinx named Azor. He was the author of the original Guildpact, as well as the creator of the elaborate contingency plan that resulted in the creation of the Living Guildpact. The Azorius Senate was meant to carry on his legacy by serving as the legislative body of Ravnica.

# INSIDE THE SENATE

The Azorius Senate is supported by three branches, called columns, each led by an arbiter (also called a capital). The capitals of the three columns form the Triumvirate, which advises the guildmaster, Supreme Judge Isperia, an ancient and wise sphinx.

The Sova Column consists of judges and the extensive legal apparatus surrounding them. It is tasked with adjudicating and arbitrating the effects of the law. The column employs legal aides, pages, librarians, experts on precedent, advocates for the accused, public prosecutors, and judges.

The Jelenn Column writes and enacts the laws of Ravnica, involving the efforts not just of the designated legislators but also a network of bureaucrats: aides, writers, researchers, lobbyists, clerks, and so on.

The Lyev Column enforces the law as Ravnica's police force. The many-leveled hierarchy of the Lyev Column includes arresters, investigators, officers, and lawmages. The Lyev Column is also venturing into the work of managing surveillance and precognition. Most adventuring characters, by their nature and because of their capabilities, are associated with the active work of the Lyev Column rather than the behind-the-scenes activity of the other columns.

#### GOALS OF THE AZORIUS

The Azorius Senate's ultimate goal is the perfection of society. They want to protect the people of Ravnica and foster a community of peace and harmony. A society's values, they contend, are reflected in the laws it creates. Something is good if it is lawful. To the Azorius, the highest virtue is a society built on stability and order, and the guild's elaborate system of laws is structured to prevent wrongdoing first and foremost, even at the expense of certain liberties. The Azorius can act as a benevolent proactive force that keeps evildoers in check, but it can also act as an oppressive bureaucratic force that stifles freedom and expression.

In the absence of the Living Guildpact, the Azorius are uncertain who is supposed to maintain balance among the guilds. As a group, they are convinced that the system can't be disrupted, but they are challenged by the reality that the one person who is meant to hold their world together never seems to be around. The Azorius Senate is invoking emergency powers with increasing frequency, and the Lyev Column's enforcers are wielding an ever-growing amount of influence.

The Azorius guild embraces the belief that Ravnican society has come too far to succumb to chaos. Civilization can be saved only through the guidance of a strong, safety-focused government. In the mind of the Azorius, the threat of chaos is imminent. They believe it is time to face facts and do whatever is necessary to protect the people and preserve the force of law.

The Azorius, as always, see agents of disorder as their greatest enemies. They have cracked down on the Gruul Clans and imposed a variety of creatively written laws outlawing that guild's presence in as many public places as possible. The Azorius also abhor the satirical

shows of the Rakdos (in part because the Azorius are frequently ridiculed by Rakdos performers) and attempt to curb them with new decrees about public performances. In response to attempts by other guilds to edge their way around the system, the Azorius routinely create new laws to support or countermand old ones.

# AZORIUS CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually lawful, often neutral Suggested Races: Human, vedalken Suggested Classes: Bard, cleric, fighter, paladin, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Azorius Senate if one or more of the following statements are true:

- · You're drawn to the idea of a hard-bitten police officer trying to impose order on a chaotic world.
- · You like the idea of using magic to control enemies.
- · You like playing enchanter wizards, clerics of law, or unbending paladins.

#### JOINING THE AZORIUS SENATE

As a recruit to the Azorius Senate, you were quickly immersed in the law. You might have clerked for a judge or a legislator, been an apprentice to a practitioner of law magic, studied rhetoric with diplomats, or trained to patrol the streets and enforce the law. As your training comes to an end and your adventuring career begins, you must decide whether to focus on law enforcement or to operate primarily within the bureaucracy of the senate.

#### LAW ENFORCEMENT

Most Azorius adventurers belong to the guild's police force. Thev are soldiers or spellcasters who patrol the city in teams or singly, preventing crimes or stopping them in progress. If you want to pursue a career in law enforcement, choose the path of the lawmage, the precognitive mage, or the arrester.

Lawmages. As a spellcaster in the Azorius Senate, you use your magic to compel or restrain malefactors and scofflaws (perhaps as a wizard specialized in the School of Enchantment). You might also use your magic to protect Azorius soldiers and innocent bystanders from harm (perhaps as a wizard specialized in the School of Abjuration or as a cleric of the Order Domain, which is described in chapter 1). In any case, you're called a lawmage, and you can aspire to the title of justiciar and then deputy as your standing within the guild increases.

Precognitive Mages. If you are a spellcaster with some ability to glimpse the future (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Divination or a cleric of the Knowledge Domain), you can use this ability to try to prevent crime before it occurs, serving as a precognitive mage. These mages occupy a small niche on the periphery of the guild, and the guild hasn't developed a bureaucratic structure to accommodate them, so they advance through the same ranks as lawmages.

Arresters. As a martial character, you can serve as an arrester in the Azorius Senate. You might be a fighter (of any martial archetype) or a paladin who has sworn the Oath of Vengeance, for example. Arresters maintain the peace by removing threats-both actual and potentialidentified through regular patrols, citizen reports, and occasionally alerts from the precognitive mages. As you gain the respect of your superiors, you can be promoted to the rank of officer or imperator.

#### BUREAUCRACY

Bureaucracy might seem like the opposite of adventure, but it is possible to immerse yourself in the life of a civil servant in the Azorius Senate and still live an adventurous life. You might be a mild-mannered judge's clerk or scribe who got caught up in a whirlwind chain of events beyond your control, or you might moonlight as a vigilante in defiance of the law you are supposed to uphold. Or you could serve a diplomatic function as an elocutor.

Elocutors. As a skilled orator and diplomat (perhaps a bard of the College of Lore), you can put your talents to use in the guild as an elocutor. The Azorius are known for their measured, patient speech, and the elocutors are the primary voice through which the senate communicates with the other guilds and the people of Ravnica. Thus, you might serve as an emissary from the Azorius to another guild, working to settle trade or territorial agreements, temporary alliances, and the like. You might have the task of securing the support of key senators for a particular piece of legislation or treaty. Well-established elocutors can be rewarded with the rank of scribe or emissary.

### BACKGROUND: AZORIUS FUNCTIONARY

The brutes are at the gate, chaos is looming, and the only thing standing in the way of disaster is the foundation of law and order-as embodied in the Azorius Senate. You're a proud member of the Azorius guild, which both enacts and enforces the laws that make Ravnican society function smoothly and safely.

#### Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Intimidation Languages: Two of your choice

- Equipment: An Azorius insignia, a scroll containing the text of a law important to you, a bottle of blue ink, a pen, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp (Azorius-minted 1-zino coins)
#### FEATURE: LEGAL AUTHORITY

You have the authority to enforce the laws of Ravnica, and that status inspires a certain amount of respect and even fear in the populace. People mind their manners in your presence and avoid drawing your attention; they assume you have the right to be wherever you are. Showing your Azorius insignia gets you an audience with anyone you want to talk to (though it might cause more problems than it solves when you're dealing with incorrigible lawbreakers). If you abuse this privilege, though, you can get in serious trouble with your superiors and even be stripped of your position.

#### SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

Members of the Azorius Senate tend toward a demeanor of cold dignity and a pragmatic, orderly nature. Steeped in the law as they are, their ideals and priorities revolve around legal issues.

#### PERSONALITY TRAITS

#### 48 Trait

- T I try never to let my judgment become clouded by emotion.
- 2 I have infinite patience with the dolts and boors I'm forced to deal with every day.

- 3 Peace. The ultimate object of the law is to remove violence from society. (Good)
- Compliance. Coercion is a fine way of ensuring that 4 the laws are obeyed. (Lawful)
- 5 Legislation. The law embodies excellence in its precision and detail. (Lawful)
- 6 Punishment. A public display of consequences is an excellent deterrent for other criminals. (Evil)

#### BONDS

#### de Bond

- I am beholden to an Azorius arrester who captured T the criminal who killed my parents, saving me from the same fate.
- I hope one day to write the laws, not just enforce 2 them.
- 3 I tried and failed to prevent a murder, and I have sworn to find and arrest the perpetrator.
- 4 I successfully prevented a murder, and the would-be perpetrator wants me dead.
- 5 One of my parents was prominent in the guild, and I resent constantly being compared to that standard.
- 6 I've modeled my career after a highly respected lawmage or arrester, but I fear that my role model might be involved in something illegal.

### AZORIUS GUILD SPELLS

Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on the Azorius Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

#### AZORIUS GUILD SPELLS

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| Cantrip | friends, message |
| 1st | command, ensnaring strike |
| 2nd | arcane lock, calm emotions, hold person |
| 3rd | clairvoyance, counterspell |
| 4th | compulsion, divination |
| 5th | dominate person |

Your magic often takes the form of blue or golden runes floating and glowing in the air in circular patterns or of shimmering azure barriers of magical energy. If you cast ensnaring strike, for example, the vines created by the spell might appear as rune-inscribed glowing bands that wrap around the target and hold it in place.

#### CHAPTER 2 | GUILDS OF RAVNICA 34

VOSS. EVEN AMUNDS

### FLAWS

#### de Flaw

- l I'm unable to distinguish between the letter and the spirit of the law.
- 2 I seem like a harsh judge to others, but I judge myself most harshly of all.
- 3 I have a secret, illegal vice.
- 4 I was traumatized by witnessing a crime as a child.
- I'm incapable of deception. 5
- 6 I wish I had joined the Boros, but I fear they'd never accept me.

#### CONTACTS

The Azorius Senate is a sprawling bureaucracy, and people in a variety of positions throughout the guild can pull strings to make things happen. Because of the guild's role in making and enforcing laws for the entire city, your place in the Azorius can easily bring you into contact with members of other guilds, for good or ill.

Roll twice on the Azorius Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Azorius Contacts table.

#### AZORIUS CONTACTS

#### d8 Contact

- 1 As a teenager, I was a page for a prominent judge.
- 2 One of my childhood friends is now a precognitive mage in service of the guild.

#### d8 Contact

- 3 I joined the Azorius hoping to impress an arrester whom I admire.
- 4 My former mentor is now a warden at Udzec, the new Azorius prison.
- 5 I was second best at everything in my legal training, and now I work with the person who was always just a little bit better.
- 6 A good friend was promoted into work they can't tell me about.
- 7 I know a homunculus in the halls of New Prahv who can get things done behind the scenes.
- 8 I was once summoned to the presence of Supreme Judge Isperia, the guildmaster of the Azorius, who complimented me on my work.

#### NON-AZORIUS CONTACTS

#### d10 Contact

- l Roll an additional Azorius contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.
- 2 The person who recruited me into the Azorius left and joined the Boros.
- 3 I have a friendship with a Dimir agent who sometimes funnels me secrets about Azorius activities.
- 4 A Golgari spore druid would love to see me slip up and break the law.

#### d10 Contact

- 5 A lesser Gruul chieftain seems to think I could be useful.
- 6 The black sheep of my family is putting their maniacal genius to use in the Izzet.
- 7 I'm friends with an Orzhov advokist; we compare notes on different forms of law magic.
- 8 I was ridiculed once in a Rakdos performance; the performer was impressed with my good humor about it and now does me occasional favors.
- 9 I have a fanatical Selesnya cousin who keeps trying to recruit me and everyone else in the family.
- 10 While growing up, I was bullied by a brat who's now a hybrid in the Simic Combine.

### How Do I FIT IN?

As a member of the Azorius Senate, you are probably engaged in the work of law enforcement (even if your background involved the legislative or judicial aspects of the senate's activities). Legislative aides and judges' clerks find little reason to venture beyond the Azorius guildhalls, but soldiers and lawmages patrol the streets daily.

An Azorius soldier or lawmage is a force for order, charged with fighting crime on the streets-and in the halls of power. You might spend your time foiling thefts, putting a stop to Orzhov extortion, rooting out Dimir spies, or hunting down Golgari assassins. Perhaps you take your orders from a precognitive mage (or you are one yourself) who receives unpredictable and cryptic visions of future crimes that you and your allies must try to prevent.

#### AN AZORIUS PARTY

An adventuring party made up entirely of Azorius members could be a specialized team dedicated to law enforcement. A soldier (a fighter or paladin) and a lawmage (wizard) would form the core of the party, supported by a precognitive mage (cleric) who helps direct their missions. An elocutor (bard) could round out the party, serving as the group's negotiator and spokesperson.

#### RANK AND RENOWN

By gaining renown as a member of the Azorius Senate, you can advance within the guild. Promotion through the ranks requires the approval of a superior officer. Advancement is a reward for services rendered to the guild, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.

#### RANK 1: OFFICIAL

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Azorius Senate

Your specific title depends on your role in the guild:

- . If you are a lawmage or a precognitive mage, you assume the title of justiciar.
- . If you are an arrester, you become an officer.
- . If you are a bureaucrat (including an elocutor), you become a scribe.

#### THREE CAPITALS

The heads of the three columns of the Azorius Senate are called arbiters or capitals.

The arbiter of the Sova Column (the judiciary) is Leonos II, a wise and kind human judge and lawmage who takes pains to consider all perspectives before issuing a judgment-even the perspectives of the spirits of the dead, with whom he can communicate. He is patient and utterly loyal to the guild.

The Jelenn Column (the legislature) is led by a vedalken lawmage named Uzana, renowned for a nearly perfect memory. She has memorized every statute of Azorius law, and much of her speech is quotations from those statutes.

The hussar commander Agmand Sarv is the arbiter of the Lyev Column, the senate's law enforcement branch. Despite the fact that he has never been in combat, he has earned a reputation as a brilliant military strategist. His tactical genius is unquestioned, but his lack of battle experience did cause some controversy among the soldiers and lawmages of the Lyev Column when he was appointed to be its head.

As an Azorius official, you can call on recruits (use the soldier stat block in chapter 6) to perform mundane tasks and errands for you, but they will not accompany you into dangerous circumstances.

No Azorius official lives in poverty. Between adventures, you earn a salary that supports you at a modest lifestyle.

#### RANK 2: AUTHORITY

Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Azorius Senate

Your new title depends on your previous role as an official in the Azorius Senate:

- · If you are a justiciar, you become a deputy with a specific title, such as Deputy of Acquittals, Deputy of Indictment, Deputy of Deposition, Deputy of Arraignment, or Deputy of Arbitration.
- · If you are an officer, you become an imperator.
- · If you are a scribe, you become an emissary.

You are recognized as an authority in your field. You gain an Azorius charm (described in chapter 5) at the start of each mission you undertake on the guild's behalf. At the start of any such mission, you can secure the assistance of a squad of 1d4 arresters (use the soldier stat block in chapter 6) plus one lawmage (also in chapter 6). These individuals remain with you until the mission ends.

Between adventures, you earn enough money pursuing your duties to support yourself at a comfortable lifestyle.

#### RANK 3: MINISTER, JUDGE, OR SENATOR

Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the Azorius Senate

Your new title depends on your broader interests as they relate to one of the three columns of the Azorius Senate, not on the titles you bore as an official and an authority:

- · If your interests lie in law enforcement, you become a minister within the Lyev Column. You receive a
ARK WINTER

specific title, such as Minister of Impediments or Minister of Fallacies.

- . If your interests concern the judiciary, you become a judge within the Sova Column.
- · If you want a position on the legislative body of the Jelenn Column, you become a senator.

Regardless of your specific title, you can secure the aid of up to 3d4 soldiers and one or two lawmages (see chapter 6 for these stat blocks) whenever you set out on a guild-approved mission.

Between adventures, your responsibilities to the guild-including supervising arresters, judging legal cases, or writing laws-earns you enough money to support yourself at a wealthy lifestyle.

#### RANK 4: ARBITER

Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the Azorius Senate

As an arbiter (or capital), you serve as the head of your column. Only Isperia, the Supreme Judge, can appoint

you to this position, and only if one of the three existing. arbiters leaves her service.

As an arbiter, all the resources of your column are at your disposal, and you have the ear of Isperia as a member of her advisory Triumvirate. You also keep the salary you earned as a minister, judge, or senator, sustaining a wealthy lifestyle between adventures.

#### ENEMIES AND ALLIES

As far as the Azorius are concerned, every other guild in Ravnica is hastening along the road to anarchy. Even other guilds that are inclined toward order (such as the Boros, Orzhov, and Selesnya) are ignoring or exploiting the law.

You participate in missions to thwart the criminals of other guilds, from overzealous Boros vigilantes to insidious Golgari assassins. Dimir spies, Orzhov extortionists, and bloodthirsty Rakdos performers keep Azorius peacekeepers busy enough, without the added complications of reckless Izzet and Simic experiments putting the citizenry in danger.

Of course, whenever the members of another guild decide to operate within the law, they are potential allies for the Azorius. Even some members of the Cult of Rakdos can be pragmatic enough to stifle their impulses for a time in order to join forces against a common enemy.

#### THE AZORIUS VIEW ON OTHER GUILDS

Because of its authoritarian, overreaching grasp, the Azorius Senate's relationships with other guilds are rarely positive. Azorius members tend to view members of other guilds as dangerous threats to order, while other guild members see the Azorius as rigid and tyrannical.

- Boros. "Their vigilantism is tremendously dangerous without a hand to control it."
- Dimir. "A perennial thorn in our side. Though they were once our greatest foes, not even the masters of espionage can hide from our watchful eyes."
- Golgari. "Their underground structures break numerous building regulations, but at least they fulfill their duties as garbage collectors."
- Gruul. "The Gruul are dangerous anarchists with no interest in furthering the development of civilization. They serve no useful purpose."
- Izzet. "Eccentric and occasionally explosive, but generally harmless, for now. In their paranoia they have enlarged their weapon stockpiles, but they lack the clarity of vision to put them to use."
- Orzhov. "Their brazen exploitation of our laws will be their downfall. They are an insidious threat that could tear society apart from the inside."
- Rakdos. "An absolute blight on Ravnica. They are clowns who know nothing of culture and exist only to torment the functioning members of society."
- Selesnya. "The Conclave plays by the rules and keeps to itself. Until its members become too numerous, they are of little threat to us."
- Simic. "The Simic experiment with matters that disobey the laws of nature and the laws of Ravnica. We must not let them gain influence."

# BOROS LEGION

A BROWN-BEARDED, BROAD-CHESTED MAN CLAD IN massive-shouldered plate armor led a battalion of soldiers, the symbol of the Boros Legion emblazoned on white cloth draped over their armor. Their soldiers were a variety of races, including humans, a minotaur with a permanent scowl on her face, an impatient-looking goblin, and even some kind of humanoid fire elemental, whose Boros armor floated in protective positions over its animate flame. -Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

Clad in shining armor and fueled by righteous zeal, the soldiers of the Boros Legion take up steel against the corruption and lawlessness that gnaw at the soul of Ravnica. Combining the force of law with the military strength to back it up, the Boros work to forge Ravnica into a just society, a safe and healthy community for all. From garrisons throughout the sprawling city, disciplined, stalwart soldiers are dispatched to stand firm against Gruul raids, Dimir infiltration, Golgari corruption, and the subtle influence of more nefarious foes.

The archangel Razia was the original guildmaster of the Boros Legion, which was established to serve as Ravnica's standing army. Razia served as its guildmaster for almost ten thousand years. Legend says that all the other angels of Ravnica were created in the image of this semidivine figure, and her death was devastating to the guild. Aurelia, the current angelic guildmaster, is the third to hold that title.

# INSIDE THE LEGION

Angels occupy the highest tier of the Boros hierarchy, from the guildmaster Aurelia down to the hosts of holy warriors and advisors in leadership roles. Their opinions and advice are deeply respected in the guild, though the angels aren't above engaging in the machinations of mortal politics. The angels include the wise, strategic warleaders; the holy champions and paragons of war known as firemanes; and battleforce angels, who form the bulk of the legion's angelic warriors.

From the perspective of the average Boros soldier, the angels embody the ideals the Boros hold dear. Few mortal soldiers gain admission into the presence of the warleaders and other powerful angels, but battleforce angels fight at the forefront of the legion's ranks, and they form strong friendships with mortals under such life-and-death circumstances. Boros paladins are the members most likely to converse with the angels and be charged with implementing their plans.

The garrison commanders who convey the angels' commands are accessible to the ordinary soldier. In addition to Sunhome, the Boros maintain smaller garrisons throughout the Tenth District, at least one in each of the six precincts.

### GOALS OF THE BOROS

Wherever criminals exploit others, petty tyrants make grabs for power, or violence erupts and leaves devastation in its wake. Boros soldiers are there fighting to make things right.

The Boros Legion is defined by the tension between its goal of establishing order and harmony and the fiery zeal that drives many of its members. The guild stands for peace and justice, which can be established only through the rule of law. Its moral stance is fundamentally good, as it strives to protect the innocent and powerless from oppression and exploitation. At the same time, members of the legion are passionate about their pursuit of justice, spurred by their righteous wrath into action against evil and injustice. Ironically, this means that individual members sometimes break the rules they are charged with enforcing, cleaving to the spirit of the law when the letter no longer serves justice.

Because the Guildpact-the one force on Ravnica that can keep the guilds from destroying each other-is now embodied in a single, unreliable person who vanishes

#### A PROUD MARTIAL TRADITION

Minotaurs have a reputation for being both fierce warriors and clever strategists. Thick of muscle, stout of heart, and possessing a burning love of justice and the battlefield, they have become the steel spine of the Boros Legion. Generations of minotaurs of the Ordruun family line have served with honor and distinction, claiming more than fifteen generals to their lineage.

for weeks or months at a time, the legion is in a heightened state of vigilance. In this time of uncertainty, the Boros are on constant alert for military threats. They work to maintain their fortifications to ensure that they aren't overrun by Gruul marauders. Construction proceeds on new strongholds near Gruul territories, but in general the Boros prepare for a military threat the same way they always have-by fielding the stronger army.

The angels are also bracing for a subtler threat: the danger of infiltration by House Dimir. The Boros are becoming increasingly aware of the possibility that their guild could be undermined from within. Security at garrison buildings is vigilant, with angels watching the entrances at all times for spies.

# BOROS CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually good, often lawful Suggested Races: Human, goblin, minotaur Suggested Classes: Cleric, fighter, paladin, ranger, wizard

Consider the Boros Legion for your character if one or more of the following sentences ring true:

- · You are drawn to the ideal of the knight in shining armor.
- · You like playing clerics, paladins, or disciplined fighters.
- · Smiting foes with holy radiance fills you with righteous joy.
- · You want to protect the innocent and fight for justice.

### JOINING THE BOROS LEGION

As a new recruit to the Boros Legion, you were sent to the prestigious Horizon Military Academy for training. Your life there was tempered in the forge of Boros discipline, devotion, and zeal. Your training regimen was deliberately harsh, to weed out the uncommitted. You lasted to the end, and now you begin your adventuring career ready to put everything vou have learned to use in the legion's service. Depending on whether you focused on martial training, studied magic, or pursued both courses, your path will look somewhat different.

#### MARTIAL TRAINING

The bulk of the Boros Legion consists of human, minotaur, and goblin soldiers. If you are a fighter, ranger, or even a barbarian, you'll fit right in among the ranks, with a promising career path ahead of you-promotion through the ranks. with opportunities for special assignments.

Another option is to join the swiftblades, the vanguard of the Boros Legion. They specialize in assault and occupation, and their squads often function as commandos or guerrillas. They pick off enemy archers and mages, softening the enemy's front lines before the rest of the legion marches in.

#### MAGICAL STUDY

If you are spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Evocation or a cleric of the Light Domain), you can find a place as a combat mage in the Boros Legion, called an embermage. These mages use spells of fire and light to clear the way for the legion's combat troops.

If you prefer healing magic over the explosive magic of the embermages (perhaps as a cleric of the Life or the Light Domain), you can become a medic. These combat healers are an essential part of Boros operations, using a combination of magic and mundane medicine to close wounds and restore strength.

#### MILITARY MAGIC

If you are a paladin who swears the Oath of Devotion, a fighter of the Eldritch Knight archetype, or a cleric of the War Domain, you can combine the martial training of a soldier with magic and call yourself a firefist. Fueled by a healthy dose of righteous zeal, firefists command a great deal of respect in the Boros Legion.

### BACKGROUND: BOROS LEGIONNAIRE

As a member of the Boros Legion, your life is devoted to the service of angels and consecrated to the work of establishing justice and peace on the streets of Ravnica. You might be a true believer, inspired by the example of the angels, moved by the plight of the downtrodden, and devoted to the cause of justice. Or you could be a cynic in the ranks, perhaps because you reluctantly followed in the footsteps of a Boros parent, succumbed to the persuasion of a charismatic recruiter's lofty promises, or were drawn in by the prospect of a life of action.

Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Intimidation Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set Languages: Choose one of Celestial, Draconic, Goblin, or Minotaur

Equipment: A Boros insignia, a feather from an angel's wing. a tattered piece of a Boros banner (a souvenir from a famous battle), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 2 gp (Boros-minted 1-zino coins)

#### FEATURE: LEGION STATION

You have an established place in the hierarchy of the Boros Legion. You can requisition simple equipment for temporary use, and you can gain access to any Boros garrison in Ravnica, where you can rest in safety and receive the attention of medics. You are also paid a salary of 1 gp (a Boros-minted 1-zino coin) per week, which (combined with free lodging in your garrison) enables you to maintain a poor lifestyle between adventures.

#### BOROS GUILD SPELLS

Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For vou, the spells on the Boros Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

#### BOROS GUILD SPELLS

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| Cantrip | fire bolt, sacred flame |
| 1st | guiding bolt, heroism |
| 2nd | aid, scorching ray |
| 3rd | beacon of hope, blinding smite |
| 4th | death ward, wall of fire |
| 5th | flame strike |

Your magic often features dramatic bursts of flame or radiance. When you cast beneficial spells on your allies, they appear momentarily surrounded with halos of bright fire.

#### SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

The Boros Legion is a zealous army, full of righteous energy tempered with military discipline. Its members share its leadership's devotion to the ideals of justice, or they find satisfaction in the more warfare-oriented aspects of the legion's work.

### How Do I FIT IN?

As a member of the Boros Legion, you are subject to the orders of your superior officers. You go where the angels tell you to go, and you do what they command you to do, to the best of your ability. If you enjoy some measure of independence, it's either because you have proven yourself capable of working without close supervision or because you're a rebellious sort who is willing to disobey orders now and face the consequences later.

As a soldier on the street, you are tasked with bringing dangerous threats like the Rakdos and the Gruul in line. You might contend with Rakdos performances gone horribly out of control, Gruul raids on outlying neighborhoods, shipments of rot-infested vegetation from the Golgari undercity, and violent uprisings among the guildless. At the same time, you might have to worry about Dimir spies infiltrating your leadership, overzealous or corrupt Azorius senators abusing the law at the expense of justice, Izzet experiments leveling city blocks, and Simic creations that break out of laboratories and wreak havoc through the Tenth District.

#### A BOROS PARTY

An adventuring party drawn entirely from the ranks of the Boros Legion would be a small military strike force, probably focused on combat but also strong on social interaction. One or two soldiers (fighters), a medic (cleric), and an embermage (wizard) would form the core of

#### TAJIC, BLADE OF THE LEGION

Tajic is a firefist who carries the exalted title of Blade of the Legion, putting him just below the angels in rank. He maintains close communication with Aurelia, though recent events in the city have set them at odds. Tajic believes that the Boros can trust only the Boros. He is convinced that any effort at peace among the guilds is doomed to failure without the Guildpact. The Boros, he argues, would be better off spending their energy to make themselves stronger so they can uphold the fragile balance that exists now-and protect the innocent when the balance tilts. Aurelia feels that his negative attitude runs the risk of poisoning the hearts of the other Boros and undermining any peace efforts. For the most part, in deference to the angel, Tajic keeps his views to himself.

that strike force. A firefist (paladin) would be a strong addition, or might replace a fighter or a cleric. A lightly armored swiftblade (ranger) could help the group in situations involving stealth or exploration.

#### RANK AND RENOWN

By gaining renown as a member of the Boros Legion, you can ascend through an ordered series of ranks within the guild. Promotion always requires the approval of a superior officer. It is a reward for services rendered to the guild, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.

In addition, certain positions become available to you when both your renown and your character level reach certain thresholds.

#### RANK 1: SERGEANT

#### Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Boros Legion

At this rank, you gain some authority over lower-ranking soldiers. When you undertake a mission on the guild's behalf that requires military strength, a squad of 1d4 soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block) accompanies and assists you for the duration of the mission.

Your salary at this rank is enough to maintain a modest lifestyle, including private quarters in the garrison.

#### SKYKNIGHT (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher in the Boros Legion, 5th level or higher

Skyknights mounted on Skyjek rocs patrol the skies above Ravnica-a regular reminder of the Boros and their concern for justice. If you meet the prerequisites, vou can become a skyknight, assuming no official objects. You are assigned a Skyjek roc (see chapter 6 for the stat block) to use as a mount when carrying out your guild responsibilities. Using the roc for personal matters is a significant violation of regulations.

#### WOJEK (SPECIAL ROLE)

#### Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher in the Boros Legion, 5th level or higher

If you meet the prerequisites, you can apply to join the elite soldiers of the Wojek League. This special order serves as a combination of military police and military intelligence, giving it a fair degree of independence within the guild. Its members scout the activities of other guilds to assess their military strength and predict potential threats, and they sometimes activate squads to defuse threats before they grow more serious. The Wojeks also help the angels root out spies and leaks within the legion. Secondarily, the Wojek League is responsible for policing the ranks of the legion. When members get carried away by their zeal and break the law or abuse their authority, the Wojeks take on the tasks of investigating, apprehending, and punishing the malefactors. Similarly, if members of the legion disappear (involuntarily or otherwise). Wojek agents are typically the ones called to investigate.

You can be both a skyknight and a member of the Wojek League, gaining the title of Skyjek.

#### RANK 2: BRIGADIER

Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Boros Legion

As a brigadier, you are responsible for missions and strategies that you can't execute entirely on your own or with the aid of a handful of soldiers. After receiving goals handed down from the captain above you, it's your job to figure out the tactics needed to accomplish those goals.

You lead a brigade that consists of six squads, each made up of four soldiers commanded by a sergeant (use the soldier stat block in chapter 6 to represent them). If you are also a skyknight, at least one of these squads is made up of other skyknights, which are soldiers mounted on Skyjek rocs (see chapter 6 for these stat blocks). You can assign these squads to tasks of your choosing within the area of the city where you have authority. You can also lead these soldiers into battle yourself, or bring one squad and its sergeant with you on a guild mission.

At this rank, you gain a Boros charm (described in chapter 5) at the start of each mission you undertake on the guild's behalf. You continue to receive a salary sufficient to maintain a modest lifestyle, but your quarters in the garrison are more spacious.

#### SUNHOME GUARD (SPECIAL ROLE)

#### Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Boros Legion, 7th level or higher

Members of the Sunhome Guard are responsible for the defense of Sunhome, the Boros guildhall in the Tenth District. Only those who have proven themselves in combat are selected to join this force. If you are accepted into the Sunhome Guard, your missions will be primarily defensive in nature. You might receive orders to find new ways to fortify the guildhall or to detect Dimir agents and other spies who try to gain access. Of course, given these chaotic times, you could end up defending Sunhome from an all-out attack by the Gruul or some other enemy force.

#### RANK 3: CAPTAIN

#### Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the Boros Legion

As a captain in the Boros Legion, you gain command of a small garrison and the responsibility for maintaining order and protecting people in part of a city district. You have four brigades under your command. As described for rank 3, each brigade has six squads of five soldiers (including a sergeant) reporting to them. One additional squad of 2d4 soldiers is your personal retinue.

You regularly receive communications from warleader angels who coordinate the efforts of the smaller garrisons. They keep you informed of the goals and concerns of the legion's mortal and angelic leaders and can help you address them. You are then responsible for giving orders to your brigadiers, and you must answer to your commander for the troops' success or failure in achieving the guild's strategic goals.

As a captain, your salary allows you to maintain a comfortable lifestyle between adventures.

#### RANK 4: COMMANDER

#### Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the Boros Legion

As a commander, you assume the leadership of one of the major garrisons of the Boros Legion: Kamen Fortress, Horizon Military Academy, or the great flying garrison called Parhelion II, which moves from place to place to deploy reinforcements to Boros troops around Ravnica. If you are already a member of the Sunhome Guard, you could instead be placed in command of that elite force, leading all the non-angelic forces of Sunhome.

In this role, you are advised-and ordered around-by angels. You are in regular communication with Guildmaster Aurelia, who places you in charge of a major guild initiative. You might be tasked with improving recruitment, developing a plan for dealing with Dimir infiltration, or collaborating with the Izzet to develop new weaponry for Boros soldiers.

You continue to draw a salary sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.

#### THE BOROS VIEW ON OTHER GUILDS

The Boros are committed to justice and order, and they are convinced that virtually every other guild is just as committed to undermining both. Therefore, the Boros rely only on their comrades for support and view everyone else with suspicion or disdain.

- Azorius. "Legalism. Arrogance. Hot air. The law in their hands is a bludgeon, and they use it to seize more power than they deserve."
- Dimir. "Snakes lurking in the shadows. They should be rooted out so they can shrivel in the light."
- Golgari. "If they limited themselves to their intended purpose, repulsive as it is, they could be allowed to survive. But they are growing into a dangerous menace, and we need to flush them out of the sewers while we still can."
- Gruul. "They are lost in violence and savagery. Only occasionally can their energy be channeled in directions that benefit the greater good."
- Izzet. "They don't understand the concept of limits. If they kept their spellcraft under control, they could truly benefit society."
- Orzhov. "The Orzhov care only about the Orzhov. If it were up to them, all of Ravnica would follow an orderly process designed to funnel wealth into their grasping hands."
- Rakdos. "They make destruction into a spectacle, but they're more than blood and fire. They're termites gnawing away at the heart and soul of Ravnica."
- Selesnya. "I almost envy the naiveté that leads them to retreat into their little communes and pretend they've built a just society."
- Simic. "They have stepped out of their place, with all their experiments, their tinkering with the nature of life. They're a waste, a drain on Ravnica, and a danger to the public good."

#### ENEMIES AND ALLIES

In general, the Boros find some common ground with other guilds that value order and structure: Azorius, Selensya, and (to a lesser extent) Orzhov. The Rakdos, Gruul, and Izzet might share the zeal and energy of the Boros, but they represent the more chaotic aspect of those qualities, which threatens the stability of all Ravnica.

The legion is dedicated to combating the influence of Dimir spies and infiltrators, containing the brutal chaos of the Rakdos, and halting the schemes of the Golgari. But any guild can become an enemy of Boros if its aims and activities lead to crime, chaos, injustice, or harm to the innocent citizens of Ravnica. Even the Azorius can become so obsessive in creating and enforcing laws that they overreach the bounds of justice.

Conversely, any guild can offer you allies in your quest for justice. Distasteful as they might be, even the Gruul and the Rakdos can play a part in curtailing threats to the city that also impede their own interests.

# HOUSE DIMIR

A vampire appeared out of the darkness, as quiet as a breeze. He was stripped to the waist despite the chill underground, and his eyes reflected light like a cat's. He floated effortlessly down from the upper reaches of the chamber, and alighted on the chamber floor near the two of them.

-Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

House Dimir is Ravnica's dark secret: behind a facade of respectable messengers and reporters lurks an association of spies and assassins whose existence is barely suspected by the populace at large. Secrecy is both House Dimir's best weapon and its best defense, and much of the guild's work is hidden even from other members. Dimir agents leave no trace of their covert activities, warping the memories of witnesses to their crimes and even wiping their own minds to remove any evidence of their completed assignments.

The first guildmaster of House Dimir was a vampire named Szadek, whose organization agreed to serve as Ravnica's couriers, information brokers, and librarians. But Szadek also used his guild's expertise at gathering information to build a vast spy network, and before long, the secret operations of the guild vastly outweighed its overt ones. Eventually the guild disappeared into the shadows, and most Ravnicans came to doubt its existence. An immortal entity, Szadek ruled the guild for ten thousand years until he was arrested and killed in the turmoil of the Decamillennial Celebration.

# INSIDE THE HOUSE

House Dimir has a clandestine aspect hidden from all but its most important members. The guildmaster, Lazav, and his direct contacts guide and manipulate the covert operations of the guild. Members of House Dimir

ultimately receive their orders from this source without having any idea of who issued the order or why. Messages to agents are funneled through thought strands (see "Spell: Encode Thoughts" later in this section) and telepathic couriers.

By design, you don't have much interaction with other members of your guild. You might never meet your primary guild contact face to face, instead receiving assignments and sending reports by way of secret message drops and codes.

#### GOALS OF THE DIMIR

House Dimir is all about secrets and misinformation, even where its own members are concerned. Any given Dimir agent knows of no more than a handful of alleyway contacts and dossier drop spots. One agent knows another only by a code name, or receives communications only at a particular meeting spot at a specific place and time. Every self-proclaimed expert with an opinion on the matter has a theory about the guild's intentions, and all those guesses about Dimir's motivations and pursuits contradict each other, frustrating any attempt to get to the truth of things. The public face of Dimir remains inscrutable, which some interpret as the best evidence that the guild's true plans mean something dire for the Ravnican populace.

To House Dimir, knowledge is power. The guild hungers to learn everything it doesn't already know, especially the weaknesses of its adversaries, and to exploit those weaknesses for its own gain. Conversely, the house holds its own secrets tightly, because it doesn't want its enemies to turn the tables. The Dimir lurk in the shadows, methodically gathering the knowledge they need to remake Ravnica to their advantage.

House Dimir's progress toward its goals depends on a web woven from meticulously gathered intelligence. Unpredictable behavior by other guilds can destabilize that web. When the Boros take sudden, forceful action inspired by an unexpected burst of zeal, the Dimir can be caught off guard. The Selesnya behave predictably on the whole, but the members of the conclave are so numerous that it can be hard for the Dimir to keep track of their activities. Of all the other guilds, the Izzet and the Gruul concern the Dimir the most; their erratic methods of decision-making, combined with their unflinching approach to danger, can quickly undermine any Dimir strategy designed to contain them.

# DIMIR CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually neutral, sometimes evil Suggested Races: Half-elf, human Suggested Classes: Monk, rogue, wizard

If the following sentences describe you, you might enjoy playing a character who belongs to House Dimir:

- · You love subterfuge, intrigue, and deception.
- · You like to play rogues, spies, and assassins.
- · The idea of stealing thoughts instead of treasure has a special appeal to you.
- · You want to deceive your fellow players without necessarily betraying them.

### JOINING HOUSE DIMIR

You began your career in House Dimir as part of the legion of shopkeepers, librarians, couriers, and traders who maintain the deception that the guild has become civil and tame. Without any exposure to the guild's more covert activities, you helped to discredit those who believe that the Dimir are plotting to control the city, painting them as delusional conspiracy theorists. But at some point your gifts were recognized and you were invited into the deeper mysteries of the guild. Your training focused on stealth, espionage, and infiltration. As a Dimir spy, you might bring a variety of talents to your work.

In your guild role, you engage in surveillance, theft, sabotage, infiltration, and other kinds of espionage. You work in a pocket or sleeper cell, unaware of the identities of most other agents or the guild's leadership. You might be a rogue of the Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster archetype, a monk of the Way of Shadow, or even a cleric of the Trickery Domain.

If you are a spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion), you have the skills needed to join the ranks of the most feared spellcasters on Ravnica: House Dimir's mind mages. Your basic work and role is the same as any other spy's, but you can learn to pull thoughts and memories from a person's mind, use a target's own thoughts against them, attack your foes' psyches directly to create delusions, or scour enemy minds clean.

### BACKGROUND: DIMIR OPERATIVE

You're a spy. Secrets and misinformation are your stock in trade. You skulk in the shadows, infiltrate other guilds, and steal the most precious secrets, whether they're written in locked journals or hidden away in someone's mind. Even you might not be aware of all the reasons behind the missions you carry out. Sometimes a mission's sole purpose is to conceal the motivation behind another strike performed in a different part of the city, or simply to spread fear.

As part of your covert work for House Dimir, you maintain a false identity as a member of another guild. You can choose your secondary guild or roll to determine it randomly. This secondary guild membership determines a portion of your starting equipment and is also where most of your contacts come from. You infiltrate your secondary guild to learn its secrets, keep tabs on its activities, or perhaps undermine it from within.

Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit Languages: One of your choice Equipment: A Dimir insignia, three small knives, a set of dark-colored common clothes, and the starting equipment of the background described in this chapter for your secondary guild

#### FEATURE: FALSE IDENTITY

You have more than one identity. The one you wear most of the time makes you appear to be a member of a guild other than House Dimir. You have documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona and fit into the secondary guild.

Whenever you choose, you can drop this identity and blend into the guildless masses of the city.

Consider why you're embedded in the secondary guild. Create a story with your DM, inspired by rolling on the following table or choosing a reason that suits you.

#### d8 Reason for Infiltration

- l My parents belong to this guild, and I let them think I'm following in their footsteps.
- 2 I've been assigned to track this guild's activities.
- I've been assigned to get close to an individual in this 3 guild and learn their secrets.
- 4 I've been assigned to recruit a new Dimir spy from the ranks of this guild.
- 5 I was a member of this guild before the Dimir recruited me.
- 6 I don't like what this guild stands for and want to destroy it from within.
- 7 I secretly wish I could leave the Dimir and join this guild, but there is no escaping the Dimir.
- 8 I chose this guild at random or on a lark.

#### DIMIR GUILD SPELLS

Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on the Dimir Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

#### DIMIR GUILD SPELLS

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| Cantrip | encode thoughts, mage hand |
| 1st | disguise self, sleep |
| 2nd | detect thoughts, pass without trace |
| 3rd | gaseous form, meld into stone, nondetection |
| 4th | arcane eye, freedom of movement |
| 5th | modify memory |

Your magic is meant to be subtle and undetectable, but it might pull shadows or clouds of mist around you as you cast your spells. Using the encode thoughts cantrip described below, you can turn a creature's thoughts (including your own) into a thought strand that others can potentially read, share, or steal. These thought strands are treated as valuable currency among the Dimir.

#### SPELL: ENCODE THOUGHTS

Enchantment cantrip

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: S Duration: Up to 8 hours

Putting a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.

If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as detect thoughts or modify memory), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.

Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting detect thoughts on the strand has the same effect.)

#### SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

Skilled at infiltration, disguise, and deception, members of House Dimir appear inscrutable. Your true personality and ideals might never manifest, or they might mark you as a quirky member of your secondary guild.

#### PERSONALITY TRAITS

#### d8 Personality Trait

- I'm good at hiding my true thoughts and feelings. l
- When I'm in doubt about revealing something, I 2 assume it's a secret, and I don't share it.
- 3 I like to sound mysterious, because wisdom hidden grows deeper with time.
- 4 I have no patience with people who get in my way.
- 5 I love hearing about other people's nightmares.
- 6 Combat is meant to be quick, clean, and one-sided.
- 7 I like to stick to the shadows.
- 8 I never show my anger. I just plot my revenge.

#### IDEALS

LINT CEARLET

#### de Ideal

- Guild. My true guild is all that really matters. (Any) ]

- 3 Secrets. I collect secrets and never reveal them. (Any)
- 4 Knowledge. I want to know as much as I can about this city and how it works. (Any)

- I discovered a secret I can't let anyone else uncover-T including my guild superiors.
- 2 I formed a close friendship or romance with someone in the guild I'm infiltrating.
- 3 The Dimir agent who recruited me was unmasked and killed. My revenge on the killers will be thorough and painful.

- 5 I'm utterly loyal to my superior in the guild, more than to the guild or its guildmaster.
- 6 Someone has discovered my true identity.

#### FLAWS

#### de Flaw

- 1 I like secrets so much that I'm reluctant to share details of a plan even with those who need to know.
- I would let my friends die rather than reveal my true 2 identity.
- 3 I have trouble trusting anyone but myself.

- 5 I'm pretty sure I've done something horrible that I can't remember because of the guild's mind magic.
- 6 I put too much trust in the people who give me orders.

#### CONTACTS

As an agent of House Dimir working undercover, you have limited contacts within your guild. Your relationships within your secondary guild, in the guise of your false identity, are usually more extensive.

Roll once on the Dimir Contacts table, giving you an ally who serves as your contact in Dimir. Then roll twice on the table for your secondary guild. The first roll gives you an ally there, and the second roll gives you a rival.

#### DIMIR CONTACTS

#### d8 Contact

- ] I know a Dimir courier who relays messages to me from someone higher up the chain of command.
- 2 I get orders from a shapeshifter I recognize only through a series of code phrases we exchange.
- 3 An ostentatiously wealthy vampire is my secret guild superior, summoning me to a luxurious estate by means of coded messages.
- 4 I have never met my guild contact, but I receive telepathic messages, usually in my dreams.
- 5 l've never met my guild contact, but I get coded messages from a pattern of street lights and graffiti.
- e I didn't discover the identity of my guild contact until after we had begun a romantic relationship.
- 7 My superior maintains an elaborate identity as a young street urchin ... unless it's all a lie, and I'm being sent on ridiculous missions by a twisted child.
- 8 My sibling and I both get telepathic orders from a mysterious contact, and I'm starting to question the authenticity of my sibling's orders.

### How Do I FIT IN?

As a Dimir adventurer, you are a member of the guild's network of spies, thieves, assassins, and mind mages that lurks behind the facade of the public guild. On the surface, House Dimir presents the appearance of a network of couriers, investigators, media reporters, and archivists, dealing in information and spreading news. But you and your peers trade in secrets. You use secret symbols, runes, and signals to surreptitiously communicate with other Dimir agents, often in plain sight.

Like any good spy, you have multiple identities: your true face as an agent of House Dimir; a guildless identity; and a role as a member of another guild. Within that secondary guild, you might already be on a mission for House Dimir, assigned to spy on the guild, collect information about a person, or recruit another spy from the ranks of the guild. Or that guild could be a launching point for your real mission. Perhaps, for example, you were ordered to infiltrate the Azorius in hopes of gaining access to a notorious inmate in an Azorius prison.

#### A DIMIR PARTY

House Dimir might send an adventuring party on missions focused on stealth and subterfuge. Such a team might be made up mostly of rogues and perhaps monks, with a mind mage (wizard) providing magical support. Potions help to offset the group's lack of healing ability.

#### RANK AND RENOWN

As you gain renown within House Dimir, you will be rewarded with missions of increasing importance. No formal ranks exist for you to progress through, but certain thresholds of renown indicate improvements in your standing within the guild. Perhaps most important, according to the philosophy of House Dimir, higher standing brings greater knowledge of the inner workings of Ravnica and the guild.

At the start of your career, your orders include step-bystep instructions-or they consist of just a single task. You receive these instructions from your guild contact.

#### INDEPENDENT AGENT

#### Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in House Dimir

As an independent agent, you have considerable latitude in the way you choose to implement your mission goals.

You acquire a spies' murmur (described in chapter 5)-a magic device that allows you to communicate telepathically with other Dimir agents who wear similar items. If this item is lost or destroyed, it's up to you to secure a replacement.

#### COLLECTOR OF SECRETS

#### Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in House Dimir

By the time you reach this level of renown in House Dimir, you are amassing a significant collection of secrets about the people and places around you. You know the location of a hidden safe house where you can take shelter in case of dire need. At the DM's discretion, you might also know (or be able to find out) a secret about a person or group who lives or operates in a neighborhood you're familiar with. The secret is typically a person's flaw or details about a dark episode in a group's past. Whatever it is, the secret is a weakness that can be used to manipulate the person or group to assist you or your associates.

In addition, you gain a Dimir charm (described in chapter 5) at the start of each mission you undertake on the guild's behalf.

#### INNER CIRCLE

#### Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in House Dimir

At this level of renown, you are responsible for coordinating the activities of several other Dimir agents. You still receive orders from the usual source, but you're given broad goals and wide latitude in how to carry them out, including delegating specific tasks to other Dimir agents of lesser renown. You are also increasingly trusted with important secrets.

#### GUILDMASTER'S CONFIDANT

#### Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in House Dimir

Few members of House Dimir ever encounter Lazav, and those who do are often unaware that they are dealing with the guildmaster. You have been admitted to his circle of confidants. He has entrusted you with a wide network of Dimir agents under your command, but you also bear tremendous responsibility for the success of the missions they undertake.

#### THE DIMIR VIEW ON OTHER GUILDS

To House Dimir, every other guild is a potential source of information, its members all potential foils and patsies.

- Azorius. "They can't be allowed to monopolize the flow of knowledge. Clog their networks with misinformation. To stop someone from discerning the truth, drown them in plausible untruths."
- Boros. "Not inherently dangerous. The true danger is that they'll drag down all we've worked for while chasing some romantic crusade. Continue to direct their righteous fury toward our strongest enemy-until the Boros threaten to become the strongest."
- Golgari. "We once appreciated them for their ability to make a corpse disappear, but we found that too many of our victims rose up to face us again. Now we use the city's fear of the swarm to keep them in their place. The more the Golgari try to rise from the mire of their reputation, the more we make them wallow in it."
- Gruul. "They've always been convenient scapegoats, but their recent aggressiveness threatens to become a larger problem. We must thin their numbers-selectively and without confrontation. Catch them alone in the dark, and take them out one by one."
- Izzet. "Even an overloaded, sizzled clock is still right twice a day. When Izzet experiments succeed, they can have unpredictable consequences for active missions. Their activities must be monitored at all times."
- Orzhov. "We're amused at how well they've used their hierarchy to mask the corruption of their organization, but their need for the public's trust gives us an edge. They can be manipulated by playing on their fear of the people discovering their ruse."
- Rakdos. "They've turned pointless activity into an art form, but their performances nevertheless make very useful distractions. Let them be bright and loud, drawing all attention, while we slip quietly through the dark."
- Selesnya. "Strength without guile is perhaps the most dangerous kind. One can't bluff the player who can't conceive of bluffing. Currently, the covert war plays to our strengths; we must ensure that the conclave never becomes conscious of the advantages they possess."
- Simic. "They are never short of intriguing surprises, so we know they are gearing up for something. Keep eyes inside their organization to see what their efforts are leading to-but don't be tempted to partake of their enhancements."

#### ENEMIES AND ALLIES

It's hard for a guild built on stealth and secrecy to maintain a positive relationship with any other guild. All guilds are monitored with suspicion, and they assessed for their current and prospective levels of threat, as well as for their usefulness to House Dimir's schemes. Each cell may foster its own relationships with the other guilds, but it ultimately defers to Dimir's enigmatic leaders to steer overarching strategy.

Your missions might put you at odds with any other guild by calling on you to infiltrate that guild and gain insight into its plans, steal proprietary information from its guildhall, or subvert its leadership. For instance, you could be tasked to steal the transcript of an Azorius interrogation, the memories of Golgari spy, or the contents of an Orzhov ledger.

You might cooperate with members of other guilds, openly or in disguise, insofar as their goals don't conflict with yours. Sometimes, the easiest way to assassinate one of your enemies is to put the forces of law on their trail, so joining forces with the Azorius and Boros, for example, can be a beneficial arrangement for everyone concerned.

# GOLGARI SWARM

A SMALL CROWD OF PALE ELVES AND HUMANS STEPPED into the light. Bits of bone and detritus woven into their matted hair clicked lightly. Their chitinous armor swarmed with tiny, riotous insects that moved in and out of the sheen of moss growing on their shoulders-a bed for sprouting fungi. Whether it was the Golgari themselves who had made the chittering sound or their bugs, Ral could not be sure. -Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

The teeming masses that compose the Golgari Swarm see themselves as pragmatic above all else, uncowed by the simple fact that death is part of the cycle of life. They believe the idea of life and death as opposing forces to be nothing more than naive sentimentality. They know everything crumbles and rots in the end, and then new life springs from that rot. Time inevitably passes, bringing both destruction and new creation to all things.

The original mandate of the Golgari Swarm under the leadership of Svogthir, its Devkarin founder, was to maintain Ravnica's agriculture and manage its waste. But Svogthir's interest in necromancy, and his eventual transformation into a lich, shaped the course of the guild's activities and gave birth to its philosophy of embracing death as part of nature's cycle.

# INSIDE THE SWARM

The leadership of the Golgari has undergone several major changes, but the nature of the swarm makes it easily adaptable to the churn of continuous cycles. Being alive isn't a prerequisite for leadership, as demonstrated by the rule of the current guildmaster, the elf lich Jarad Vod Savo. Assassination is seen as a perfectly valid means of effecting political change, which is how Jarad's sister, Savra, took control of the guild before him. Various groups of people and monsters coexist within the swarm, their relative power waxing and waning with the years, and through it all, the guild goes on.

The three most important power groups within the Golgari are the Devkarin elves, the medusas (also called gorgons in Ravnica), and the insectile kraul. Iarad is an undead representative of the Devkarin, so the elves claim a privileged position within the guild for the moment.

Members of the Golgari Swarm live in the shadow of Jarad and the leaders of the individual factions. The machinations among elves, medusas, kraul, and other creatures rarely bring any significant improvement to the lives of the swarm's countless members, but often cause disruption and occasionally disaster. Most guild members believe it's best to keep their heads down and stay out of the political conflict and to avoid attracting the disfavor of the Ochran, the guild's order of assassins. More adventurous members might enjoy intrigue and politics, or might unwittingly become tangled up in the schemes of the guild's leaders.

Jarad maintains a council of shamans and rogues to serve as a combination of advisory parliament and spy agency. These high chancellors rarely convene publicly, preferring to disperse themselves throughout the swarm to keep information flowing from the nucleus to every part of the organism.

#### GOALS OF THE GOLGARI

The Golgari Swarm celebrates the growth and vibrancy of the natural world, but gives equal attention to nature's facets of destruction, decay, and death. It finds allies and agents in the form of fungi, oozes, insects, diseases, and

#### DARK ELVES OF THE GOLGARI

Also called the elves of shadow, the Devkarin are one of the three branches of Ravnica's elf race. Like other elves, the Devkarin are adept spellcasters, counting most of the Golgari's shamans among their number.

After being cast out of the nascent Selesnya Conclave millennia ago, the Devkarin found a home amid the corrupted and overgrown places of Ravnica, and the Devkarin necromancer Svogthir became the founder of the Golgari Swarm. Since then, the Devkarin have been a major influence in the guild, even during the times when they didn't hold absolute power. Regardless of who rules the guild, the Devkarin follow the guidance of a high priest, called the matka. The matka's spiritual leadership usually aligns with the guildmaster's temporal commands, but during times when the guild is ruled by a non-elf faction, the matka can be a significant dissenting voice.

other unsavory aspects of nature, and it uses the power of nature actively toward the goal of advancing its own place in the world. But the Golgari have also learned patience from nature; they are content to work from the shadows, harnessing the energy that comes from decay while the civilization of Ravnica slowly erodes and destroys itself.

The teeming hordes of the Golgari Swarm believe it is finally their time to shine. They have dwelled under the streets and under the sway of the other guilds for too long. They are convinced that Ravnica's institutions are now on the verge of collapse and that the absence of the Living Guildpact proves it. However, the Golgari are neither surprised nor panicked by this, for they believe that all things eventually rot and die, and from this decay, new life blooms. As such, the Golgari see the looming interguild conflict as a necessary final push to bring about a new era-their era.

The Golgari are preparing for upheaval. They have sealed many of the passages leading into the undercity, making their territory seem like an impregnable subterranean fortress. Within it, the Golgari domain retains its grandeur, a mysterious and wondrous kingdom. The rare visitors who stumble into it are awed by its beauty and its aura of ancient power. Palatial architecture fills cavernous sewer chambers, and luminescent spores float through the air to shed an otherworldly light on the moss-covered masonry. Entering Golgari territory feels like stepping into a secret world of dangerous beauty.

# GOLGARI CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually neutral, often evil Suggested Races: Human, elf (dark) Suggested Classes: Druid, fighter, ranger, rogue, wizard

The Golgari Swarm might suit your character if one or more of the following statements are true:

- · You're drawn to the darker side of nature or the greener side of necromancy.
- · You are drawn to sinister, creepy, or grim characters.
- · You like elves and druids but want to explore an unusual direction.

### OINING THE GOLGARI SWARM

Similar to a swarm of insects, the Golgari collectively behave more like a single organism than a scattering of individuals. New members aren't recruited or initiated into the Golgari Swarm; you have been absorbed and incorporated, and the biological system of the swarm funneled you to where your talents are most needed to contribute to the health of the guild. Your position within the guild is defined by your capabilities.

You might act as a shaman of the Golgari if you are a spellcaster-perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Necromancy, a druid of the Circle of the Land, or a druid of the Circle of Spores (described in chapter 1). In this revered position, you teach and advise other members of the swarm, keeping them attuned to the natural cycle of death and regrowth. You might manipulate that natural cycle by wielding the magic of death, snuffing

out life and reanimating the dead. Or you might wield your magic to spread fungal rot and noxious gases, preparing parts of the city for annexation.

If you aren't adept at magic, the swarm still needs you. Golgari warriors both defend the guild's territory and, when necessary, take offensive action. If you are a fighter (typically of the Champion archetype), you can serve as a shock trooper, perhaps fighting alongside kraul and trolls on behalf of the swarm. If you are a ranger (likely of the Beast Master archetype) or a rogue (of the Thief or Assassin archetype), you are more of a skirmisher. Golgari rangers favor insects and reptiles as companions.

### BACKGROUND: GOLGARI AGENT

You are a member of a teeming horde-one small part of a sprawling organism. Just as you are part of the swarm, the swarm is part of a larger ecosystem, a never-ending cycle of life, death, rot, and rebirth. You have spent your life in the slow churn of that ecosystem, in the dark places of the city where the messy parts of existence are on display. There is little squeamishness among the Golgari, no fear of death or taboo about the dead, just a fierce affirmation of the cycle.

# Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Survival

Tool Proficiencies: Poisoner's kit

- Languages: Choose one of Elvish, Giant, or Kraul Equipment: A Golgari insignia, a poisoner's kit, a pet beetle or spider, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp worth of mixed coins
#### FEATURE: UNDERCITY PATHS

You know hidden, underground pathways that you can use to bypass crowds, obstacles, and observation as you move through the city. When you aren't in combat, you and companions you lead can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow. The paths of the undercity are haunted by dangers that rarely brave the light of the surface world, so your journey isn't guaranteed to be safe.

#### GOLGARI GUILD SPELLS

Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on the Golgari Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

#### GOLGARI GUILD SPELLS

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| Cantrip | dancing lights, spare the dying |
| 1st | entangle, ray of sickness |
| 2nd | protection from poison, ray of enfeeblement, |
|  | spider climb |
| 3rd | animate dead, plant growth |
| 4th | giant insect, grasping vine |
| 5th | cloudkill, insect plague |

Golgari magic is often accompanied by a sickly green glow and a rotting stench.

#### SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

Members of the Golgari Swarm are unmistakably products of the undercity, ill at ease amid the comforts of civilization. They bring about the same discomfort in others by reminding them of death's inevitable approach.

#### PERSONALITY TRAITS

#### d8 Personality Trait

- 1 Remember, I could kill you in your sleep. Or put centipedes in your bedroll. 2 I like to remind people of their inevitable demise.
- 3 Sometimes I give voice to the whispers of the rot, which I hear but no one else does.
- I do my best to discourage anyone from approaching 4 or talking to me.
- I have accepted my death. Hence, I don't fear it. 5
- 6 Like roots growing through stone, I am relentless and determined in my action.
- 7 I put my knowledge of anatomy to use by narrating the injuries my enemies suffer in grisly detail.
- Like a wild animal, I lash out viciously when I'm 8 provoked-and I'm easily provoked.

#### IDEALS

#### de Ideal

- 1 Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)
- 2 Stoicism. All of us are part of the cyclical march of nature, which will continue with or without us. (Neutral)
- 3 Nature. The natural world is more important than the edifices of the city and civilization. (Neutral)
- 4 Interdependence. We are all part of nature's web. (Lawful)
- 5 Ambition. The time of Golgari ascendance is at hand, and I intend to have a prominent place in the new world order. (Evil)
- 6 Live and Let Live. Meddling in the affairs of other guilds is a great way to get squashed like a bug. (Neutral)

#### BONDS

#### de Bond

- l I cherish the finger of a family member who was petrified by a medusa.
- 2 I have an identical twin who is as different from me as any person could be.
- 3 I want to lead one faction of the guild to a new position of dominance.
- 4 I love spending time in the moss-covered building where I took part in my first reclamation mission.
- 5 I found something in the sewer that must never come to light.
- 6 I am forever grateful to the reclaimer who found me floating facedown in the sewer, moments from death.

#### FLAWS

#### de Flaw

- l Death comes for us all, so you can't expect me to take care of someone who can't fight it off.
- 2 l assume that anyone outside the Golgari looks down on me.

#### de Flaw

- I feel a need for revenge against those who enjoy the 3 privilege of living above ground.
- 4 I don't bother to couch my opinions in flattering words.
- 5 I can't help but pocket any trinket or coin I come across, no matter how worthless.
- 6 I'm convinced that I'm better and stronger than members of other guilds, isolated as they are from the realities of life and death.

#### CONTACTS

To the extent that the Golgari Swarm acts like a single organism, you are connected to every other member in some way or another. Convinced that the rest of the world is out to get you, you find it easy to form close bonds with your guild mates, and harder to make meaningful connections with others.

Roll twice on the Golgari Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Golgari Contacts table.

#### GOLGARI CONTACTS

- d8 Contact
- ] One of my parents is an elite assassin, a member of the Ochran.
- 2 I learned combat from a kraul.
- 3 I know a medusa who is stationed in the guildhall.
- 4 I had a torrid romance with a spore druid responsible for a large rot farm.
- 5 There's a troll in a remote area of the undercity who seems to find me interesting-and who knows more than you'd think.
- An elf lich is determined to see me become a lich 6 someday, too.
- 7 A medusa decided it would be more fun to recruit me into the guild than to kill me.
- 8 I know a findbroker who can locate just about anything, for the right price.

### NON-GOLGARI CONTACTS

#### d10 Contact

- An Azorius arrester I literally pulled out of the gutter ] will do anything for me.
- Someone joined the Gruul in a battle against the 2 Boros once, and the sergeant of that Boros squad would love to prove that it was me.
- 3 I had a romance with a Dimir agent whom I still feed secrets to.
- Roll an additional Golgari contact; you can decide if 4 the contact is an ally or a rival.
- 5 I joined the Gruul in a battle against the Boros once, and the chief of that small clan thanks me for turning the tide.

### How Do I FIT IN?

As part of the Golgari Swarm, you are a specialized instrument of the greater body. Your orders, when you have such, come from the guildmaster by way of his chancellors, who carry his messages throughout the guild. The swarm relies on you to advance the greater good by protecting some part, however small, of its teeming existence. That responsibility doesn't mean you're indispensable; your eventual death is part of your purpose and function, too, and you'll be replaced even as your body provides nutrients to further the swarm's growth.

A classic adventuring role for a member of the Golgari involves crawling through dungeon-like environmentsthe sewers and ancient vaults of the undercity-in search of treasures left behind by the dead. Sometimes you might be sent to find a specific item believed lost in a dangerous part of the undercity. At other times, you could be asked to collect samples of a specific fungus, retrieve a body floating in the muck of the sewers, or bring back whatever booty you can to help fill the swarm's coffers.

You might gain enough renown to become a member of the Ochran, assigned to a variety of tasks concerning thievery, assassination, or the protection of important figures in your guild. You might steal something because the guild needs it, or because its loss will bring harm to another guild, hastening that group's decline.

You could be assigned to kill an outspoken and active enemy of the Golgari, such as an overzealous Boros captain whose raids into the undercity have approached dangerously close to the swarm's inner sanctum. Or you could serve as a bodyguard to one of Guildmaster Jarad's high chancellors, escorting this figure through the undercity while being ready to intervene at a moment's notice if things go wrong.

The shamans of the Golgari use their magic to accelerate the cycle of decay and regrowth. You might be sent to spread spores throughout an area that the Golgari want to claim as their territory or to convince the inhabitants of such a territory to abandon it. You might also contend with the ever-present threat of hostile monsters encroaching into Golgari-controlled regions.

#### A GOLGARI PARTY

An adventuring party drawn from the teeming ranks of the Golgari Swarm might focus on traversing the undercity or on stealthy missions in the streets above. A pair of shamans (a druid and a wizard) would form the core leadership of the group, supported by a warrior (fighter or ranger) and a stealthy member of the Ochran (rogue).

#### RANK AND RENOWN

Every member of the Golgari Swarm has its place, and every role is important to the proper functioning of the guild. Aside from a few leadership positions, the swarm doesn't consider different functions to be more or less important than others. The idea of progressing up the ranks is foreign to the Golgari way of thinking. That said, your renown within the Golgari is a direct measure of the guildmaster's knowledge of you, his confidence in your abilities, and his interest in your activities.

At the start of your career with the Golgari, the guildmaster and his chancellors have no way to distinguish you from the masses of others who perform a similar function. If you receive instructions from the high chancellors, the orders are directed toward you as part of a larger group: for example, "Reclaimers, keep your eyes open for an Izzet keyrune believed to be lost in this sector of the sewers."

#### AGENT

#### Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Golgari Swarm

You have distinguished yourself from the mass of your peers. Guildmaster Jarad might not know your name, but he knows that a member of your group is reliable and effective, and his high chancellors single you out for specific missions. The guild provides you with supplies you need to complete those missions (within reason).

#### MONSTROUS FAVORS

#### Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Golgari Swarm

When you reach this level of renown in the Golgari Swarm, Jarad knows your name and appreciates that you can be relied on to help fulfill the guild's objectives. Thanks to this prominence, you can get away with begging a favor from the guild's more monstrous members. You can ask an undercity medusa, a troll, or a kraul death priest to help you with a task that benefits the

Golgari Swarm. The creature is not obligated to help you, but it holds you in enough esteem to at least consider it-in exchange for the promise of a favor in return.

In addition, you receive a Golgari charm (described in chapter 5) at the start of each mission you undertake on the guild's behalf.

#### OCHRAN (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Golgari Swarm

Having achieved considerable renown within the guild, you can choose to become a member of the Ochran. The Ochran often serve as stealthy bodyguards, lurking out of sight until some danger threatens their wards. The Ochran are also sent out as assassins or burglars to further the guild's goals.

#### ADVISOR

Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in the Golgari Swarm

Although you aren't yet one of Jarad's personal counselors, your value to the guild is clear. The high chancellors regularly call on you to perform tasks for the guild and to share your insights. You can be sure that anything you say to a high chancellor will pass quickly to the ears of the guildmaster.

#### HIGH CHANCELLOR

Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Golgari Swarm

Jarad seeks out the most powerful, effective, and loyal members of the Golgari Swarm to serve as his high chancellors. At this point, you certainly qualify. The amorphous nature of Jarad's council means that you don't need to wait for a vacancy to open up: Jarad summons you to his presence, and you are expected to appear and accept the new position offered to you.

As a high chancellor, you advise Jarad in his decision-making, keep him informed of happenings throughout the guild, and convey his instructions to the various parts of the guild's "body."

#### MATKA (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Golgari Swarm, elf (dark), spellcasting ability

You are eligible to fill the role of matka, the high priest of the Golgari elves. You can attain this position only if the previous matka has died or stepped down. Becoming matka requires you to claim the position and maintain your title against any challengers. It isn't unusual for competing claims among would-be matkas to be resolved by combat ... or assassination.

As matka, your status among the Devkarin is comparable to that of the guildmaster's. Even high chancellors who are Devkarin attempt to balance their loyalty to Jarad with their loyalty to you.

#### ENEMIES AND ALLIES

The Golgari Swarm shares a general philosophical approach with the other nature-oriented guilds-Simic, Gruul, and Selesnya-in its concern for the forces of life and growth. Under the right circumstances, a member of the Golgari can work well with agents of those organizations. But the Golgari's emphasis on death as part of the life cycle is foreign to those other guilds.

The Golgari prefer to erode their enemies' strength through a process of attrition rather than by launching frontal attacks. If you are called on to take direct action against another guild, it is probably a matter of self-preservation against a guild that is threatening the life and livelihood of the Golgari. You might oppose the Azorius as they attempt to extend their jurisdiction into the undercity or strike back at the Boros to dissuade them from launching more attacks into Golgari territory. Occasionally, you might be assigned to assault the enemies of the Golgari more directly, especially if you are a member of the Ochran. If the death of a particular person or the theft of a key treasure will contribute to the decline and downfall of an enemy guild, even the typically patient Golgari will try to seize that opportunity.

You might ally with members of another guild if they are working-even unwittingly-toward goals you share. The Gruul, for example, are adept at hastening the decay of both humanoid populations and physical structures, even if they remain unaware of their full role in the natural cycle. If some event threatens to upset the balance of nature, such as a necromantic blight that kills all growth or a magical wildfire rampaging through the city, you might join other nature-oriented guilds in an attempt to curtail it and preserve the balance.

#### THE GOLGARI VIEW ON OTHER GUILDS

To the Golgari, the other guilds of Ravnica are shortsighted and inevitably doomed to collapse.

- Azorius. "Such hubris! As if all their laws could shore up this crumbling society. Their regulations and institutions are just detritus in the making."
- Boros. "The Boros speak a language we will never understand. Their militant dedication to empty concepts like 'justice' and 'righteousness' is both confusing and disturbing."
- Dimir. "They collect information like trinkets, so how can they ever grasp the deeper truths we possess? But their presence in the undercity is an all-too-real threat to our dominion beneath the streets."
- Gruul. "The clans serve as effective instruments of the natural cycle, though in their anger, they are blind to the extent of the role they play."
- Izzet. "Perplexing. They are attracted to whatever flashes brightest and booms loudest. Their fascination with their toys will only hasten their own end."
- Orzhov. "They flout the natural order and use their knowledge of death to resist its pull. While their bodies rot, their spirits persist, clinging to the fiction of material wealth."
- Rakdos. "They understand the inevitability of death but seek to hasten its arrival for their petty ends. What the demon destroys, we nurse back to life again."
- Selesnya. "Their reverence for nature is the mark of immaturity and naiveté. They fear death, so they can't understand life. They can be dangerous when they fervently cling to their narrow-minded and inadequate view of life."
- Simic. "They seek patterns in the natural world, which is commendable enough, but they believe the search will lead them to find perfection through all of its flaws. They strive to move forward but fail to see that the path they tread is cyclical."

# GRUUL CLANS

JACE HAD NEVER SEEN, OR FOR THAT MATTER SMELLED, A Gruul war party at all. Their armor was made from animal hides and bones, and their weaponry was heavy pieces of scavenged city rubbish. Their skin was alive with tattoos, etched with a combination of magic, ink, and, Jace supposed. a considerable amount of pain. Each of them was a hulk of muscle, and Ruric Thar was the largest and mightiest of them all.

-Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

The Gruul Clans are a wild people in a civilized land, a loose affiliation of bands that squat on the fringes of Ravnican society. They shun the centers of civilization, which they see as a source of oppression and weakness, and instead haunt Ravnica's alleyways, abandoned zones, and ruins. They want to see the edifice of civilization torn down so the world can revert to the pure wilderness that thrived before the city grew to cover everything. Then the true order of nature can be restored-an unbridled and brutal state in which only the strong survive and the strongest rule.

In a world covered with city streets and towering buildings, the Gruul are the most out of place, the most ill at ease, and the most eager to topple it all and start fresh. Constant ritualistic warfare reverberates among the clans, every skirmish reinforcing their doctrine of the survival of the fittest. They frequently send sorties into civilized areas to secure goods-and to wreak havoc.

The first leader of the Gruul was Cisarzim, a cyclops who was purportedly the ancestor of Borborygmos, the current guildmaster. Cisarzim was called the Lord of Chaos, and his guild's original function as maintainers of Ravnica's natural places meant keeping his faction as remote as possible from the civilized parts of the world. The gradual expansion of the city, however, has driven the Gruul into smaller and smaller refuges.

# INSIDE THE CLANS

As a collection of disparate clans, the Gruul have no single leader and no headquarters. But the Gruul respect strength and are willing to follow a strong individual who points them in a direction they want to go anyway. For several decades, that position has been held by the mighty cyclops Borborygmos, chief of the Burning Tree clan. His nihilistic anger inspires the rest of the Gruul, so when he calls on the other clans to join a raid, they usually agree. Even the fractious Gruul can see the benefit of banding together. The clans sometimes gather at Skarrg, a ruined palace in the rubblebelt adjoining the Tenth District. Here are descriptions of the clans:

- Burning Tree Clan. The Burning Tree clan is the most fearsome of the Gruul Clans, as well as the largest and most diverse, with branches in several districts of Ravnica. The fear and awe inspired by Borborygmos unifies its diverse membership. The Ravnican populace regards the symbol of the Burning Tree clan as the symbol for the entire Gruul guild.
- Ghor Clan. The Ghor clan is led by an ettin named Ruric Thar (or, perhaps more properly, Ruric and Thar, since the heads claim separate names). Of all the clans, the Ghor carry out the most frequent and savage assaults on Ravnica's citizenry. The clan is known for its audacity in forging encampments close to heavily populated districts.
- Scab Clan. Members of the Scab clan display scars and body modifications, which they view as expressions of the powerful rage they harbor within themselves. The clan has grown in influence by engulfing or destroying several smaller clans in recent years, but the leader of the Scabs, a corpulent giant known as Narbulg Nine Fingers, has not gone so far as to challenge the Burning Tree clan.
- Slizt Clan. The Slizt clan is a clutch of sly, skittish warriors, consisting largely of reptilian humanoids called viashino (use the lizardfolk stat block in the Monster Manual to represent them), along with a few wily humans. This clan survives in the rubblebelts by taking up hiding places in high ground and ambushing its enemies with ranged attacks from above. Other Gruul regard the Slizt as skulkers and cowards, but nonetheless all are cautious when entering areas with elevated ruins. The home ground of the Slizt clan is the Husk, an area at the center of a vast rubblebelt featuring many large, ancient structures that have remained standing for generations.

#### ITCHING FOR A FIGHT

Gruul goblins live in colonies scattered at the edges of Gruul territory and civilized neighborhoods. They fight fiercely when threatened, punctuating their attacks with hisses and growls. When battle fury takes hold of a Gruul raiding group, it typically starts with the goblins, and after the battle, the surviving goblins are still frothing at the mouth and looking for someone to hit.

- Gravel Hide Clan. The Gravel Hide clan believes that resilience is the truest measure of strength. Though a relatively new group, its members have already earned a reputation (almost certainly exaggerated) for shrugging off devastating attacks. The clan's leader, a hot-tempered goblin named Skorik Boulder Tooth, adorns himself with the shattered remnants of weapons that he has rent to bits with his own jaws.
- Zhur-Taa Clan. The Zhur-Taa clan advocates an extreme interpretation of the Old Ways. Central to this view is its belief in the imminent awakening of an ancient boar god-Ilharg, the Raze-Boar-who will lay waste to the overcivilized world. Led by a centaur druid called Nikya of the Old Ways, the Zhur-Taa pile up skulls as offerings to this god, and their druids perform guttural chants before and during battle that are said to be in the language of the old gods.

Zhur-Taa druids are adept at summoning and training beasts as war-companions and mounts, and the clan's warriors wade into battle alongside giant boars, other beasts, and even wurms or hydras.

- Bolrac Clan. The most selective of all the Gruul Clans, the Bolrac clan denies membership to the smaller races. Its members are all enormous, lumbering brutes, primarily cyclopes, ogres, and giants. The clan's leadership changes frequently-sometimes daily, since battles for supremacy are as common as meals. The Bolrac clan specializes in bringing down massive structures using mauls and battering rams. The only thing the Bolrac love more than destroying something smaller than them is toppling, overrunning, and destroying something larger than them.
- Trogs. Some wandering hermits, known as trogs, find even the company of a clan to be too suffocating, so they spend their days alone in the wild places of Ravnica. These individuals are fierce, independent warriors who traverse the rubblebelts as apex predators. Trogs are notoriously short-tempered and impatient around others. Occasionally, they heed the call of the guildmaster to join in riots or festivals, but more often they conduct their own ceremonies and celebrations in private.

#### GOALS OF THE GRUUL

So far as any philosophy can be said to underlie the Gruul way of life, it is about living in the now, with little concern for forethought, planning, or speculation. Impulse drives the actions of the Gruul Clans. They want to live their lives unimpeded, and they lash out when something tries to stand in their way. Emotion and impulsiveness drive them as they seek to do what they want, take what they want, and smash what they want.

# GRUUL CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually chaotic, often neutral Suggested Races: Human, centaur, goblin, minotaur Suggested Classes: Barbarian, cleric, druid, fighter, ranger

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Gruul Clans if one or more of the following sentences are true:

- · You enjoy playing rage-mad barbarians and savage druids.
- · You want to throw off the shackles of civilization and indulge your inner beast.
- · You like being a force of chaos who keeps things moving in your adventures.

### JOINING THE GRUUL CLANS

You might have been born and raised among the Gruul, like many of the guild's members. Or you could be an outcast, a refugee, or a fugitive from civilized society, shunned for your violent ways or for fleeing the hand of justice. As long as you are strong enough to survive among the Gruul, you are welcome, no matter what secrets haunt your past.

The Gruul "guild" is actually a collection of different, independent clans loosely united under one powerful leader. When you decide to join the Gruul, you join a specific clan, not the guild as a whole. You can roll a d8 or choose from the options in the Gruul Clan Options table to determine your character's clan allegiance.

#### GRUUL CLAN OPTIONS

|
|  |

- Burning Tree clan l
- 2 Ghor clan
- 3 Scab clan
- 4 Slizt clan
- 5 Gravel Hide clan
- 6 Zhur-Taa clan
- 7 Minor or new clan
- 8 Trog

The rites of becoming Gruul, whether you have come from outside the guild or are marking your entrance into adulthood, center around being buried alive. When you enter the shallow grave, the person you were before is dead. Your past wrongs and errors are forgotten, but so are your past accomplishments. No matter how well you proved yourself in battle before, when you rise from the earth you are untested. The clan leaders recognize you only when you earn glory in battle as a Gruul.

Most of the Gruul find their place among the fierce warriors of their clans. If you are a fighter, ranger, or barbarian, this is your natural role. Gruul fighters tend to adopt the Champion archetype, Gruul rangers usually adopt the Hunter or the Beast Master archetype, and Gruul barbarians follow either the Path of the Totem Warrior or the Path of the Berserker. Whatever your class, as a Gruul warrior you are devoted to tearing down the edifices of civilization, both physical and

institutional. You lash out at a system that you believe is the root of corruption and weakness.

If you are spellcaster, such as a druid (usually of the Circle of the Moon) or a cleric of the Tempest Domain, vou might adopt a more spiritual role in your clan. You practice what the Gruul call the Old Ways, a discipline that predates the foundation of civilization on Ravnica, to channel the primal energy that still pulses through the wild places of the world.

### BACKGROUND: GRUUL ANARCH

The entire world of Ravnica is a sprawling metropolis, but you are a native of the wild areas that still exist-the abandoned districts, the rubblebelts, the overgrown parks, and the crumbling ruins. You are part of a savage society that clings desperately to the Old Ways-attuned to nature, full of primal rage, and given short shrift by a world consumed with continuing civilization's march of progress.

Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Athletics Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism kit

- Languages: Choose one of Draconic, Giant, Goblin, or Sylvan
- Equipment: A Gruul insignia, a hunting trap, an herbalism kit, the skull of a boar, a beast-hide cloak, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins)

#### FEATURE: RUBBLEBELT REFUGE

You are intimately familiar with areas of the city that most people shun: ruined neighborhoods where wurms rampaged, overgrown parks that no hand has tended in decades, and the vast, sprawling rubblebelts of broken

terrain that civilized folk have long abandoned. You can find a suitable place for you and your allies to hide or rest in these areas. In addition, you can find food and fresh water in these areas for yourself and up to five other people each day.

#### GRUUL GUILD SPELLS

Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on the Gruul Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

#### GRUUL GUILD SPELLS

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| Cantrip | fire bolt, produce flame |
| 1st | compelled duel, speak with animals, |
|  | thunderwave |
| 2nd | beast sense, shatter |
| 3rd | conjure animals, conjure barrage |
| 4th | dominate beast, stoneskin |
| 5th | destructive wave |

Fueled by the fire of rage burning in your heart, your magic is almost always accompanied by fiery effects, such as flames smoldering behind your eyes or dancing over your hands.

#### SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

Gruul ways aren't the ways of civilized folk, and the Gruul have little patience for social niceties. But they do have cherished traditions and values, just as important to them as the different values held by the urban, cosmopolitan culture of Ravnica.

### How Do I Fit In?

In service of a simple goal, you have a simple part to play: Fight. Unleash your rage. Flatten buildings and defeat those who stand in your way. Be Gruul, in vour own way.

You will frequently be summoned to participate in a raid your clan is launching against the city or against a group of its defenders. Your clan leader might also send you on a special mission, though it would almost certainly still qualify as a raid. You might join a small group of Gruul warriors on a dangerous charge deep into the settled streets to plunder a certain location, retrieve an item stolen from your clan, or assault a Boros garrison.

Sometimes vour objective might be more esoteric. With prophecies of the return of Ilharg the Raze-Boar spreading like wildfire among the Gruul druids, you might be asked to carry out some task that the druids believe will speed his coming. Such a task might involve collecting a sacred relic held in an Orzhov vault or collecting sacrifices for a grand ceremony in the Raze-Boar's honor.

#### A GRUUL PARTY

A group of Gruul adventurers can serve as a raiding party to pursue the goals of one clan or the guild as a whole. The combination of anarchs and berserkers (fighters, rangers, and barbarians) with druids of the Old Ways (druids or clerics) creates a powerful mix of muscle and magic. Such a party lacks the capacity for subtlety or stealth, but Gruul missions rarely require such abilities. (A ranger can provide them, in the rare case where they are necessary.)

#### RANK AND RENOWN

Renown among the Gruul could also be called glorywhen you prove yourself in battle, you earn the respect of your fellows. With glory comes acceptance of your leadership and warriors willing to follow you into battle. The Gruul have no formal holders of titles aside from the chieftains of clans and the guildmaster, but relative status within one's clan is still important.

#### PROVEN

#### Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in your clan

With several battles under your belt, you have demonstrated service to your clan and earned the recognition of your peers. You have the right to tattoo your body to commemorate your triumphs in battle and demonstrate your loyalty to the Gruul. You don't yet have authority over others, but when you go into battle with your clan. vour fellow warriors fight near you, acknowledging your prowess. Your clan chieftain knows your name and might decide to single you out, offering you an opportunity to prove yourself by performing a special task. Depending on the nature of the task, the chieftain might send 1d4 anarchs (see chapter 6 for the stat block) along to help you.

#### BEAST-FRIEND

#### Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in your clan-

When you reach this level of renown, you develop a rapport with the beasts that haunt the rubblebelts. When you are in a rubblebelt area, you can summon one beast to be your mount: a batterboar (a giant boar as described in the Monster Manual), a ceratok (using the stat block of a rhinoceros), or a raktusk (equivalent to a giant elk). It doesn't fight for you unless you have magic or another ability that can control a beast.

In addition, when you carry out a raid on the guild's behalf, a druid of your clan gives you a Gruul charm (described in chapter 5) at the start of the raid.

#### CELEBRATED

#### Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in your clan

You are a hero in your clan, and your reputation extends to other clans as well. You can count on the aid of your clan in most situations. Your clan's druids cast spells for you, and you lead a warband that consists of 3d4 anarchs (see chapter 6 for the stat block) plus three berserkers or ogres (see the Monster Manual for their stat blocks).

Your chieftain keeps an eye on you, aware that you're a potential challenger for leadership of the clan.

#### CHIEFTAIN

#### Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in your clan

You can now rightfully challenge your chieftain in single combat for leadership of the clan or take the warriors loyal to you and form a new clan.

#### ENEMIES AND ALLIES

By standing in opposition to the civilized ways of the other guilds, the Gruul Clans have made it practically impossible to establish alliances with those guilds.

Similar to the Golgari, Selesnya, and Simic, the Gruul respect nature and maintain a close relationship with animals-in the Gruul's case, the monstrous beasts that stalk the rubble and ruins. But the Gruul would just as soon smash the sewers, gardens, and laboratories of those other guilds than cooperate with them in an effort to establish nature as a larger presence within the city.

Because they see all of the remaining guilds as cogs in the vast machine of civilization, the Gruul tailor their tactics toward breaking the machine, rather than directing their attacks at any particular guild. Any guild can be the target of Gruul aggression, as the opportunity arises. The fiercest assaults often come against the guilds that take it upon themselves to combat the Gruul, primarily the Boros and Azorius.

In certain circumstances, such as when some nightmarish horror rears its head in the heart of a rubblebelt, you and your clan could accept the help of members of another guild in putting an end to the danger. Or, when the schemes of other guilds pit one clan against another, there might be some benefit to you and your clan in cooperating with those efforts. But your truest allies are other members of your clan.

#### THE GRUUL VIEW ON OTHER GUILDS

Since every other guild participates to some extent in the establishment and sustenance of the civilization that the Gruul despise, the Gruul look down on all other guilds as soft, corrupt, or downright abhorrent.

- Azorius. "Civilization is a disease, and the Azorius are its plague bearers. Once they are destroyed, Ravnica will reclaim its primal essence."
- Boros. "Puppets who are all too eager to kneel at the feet of their angel handlers."
- Dimir. "Skulkers, whisperers, and back-stabbers! They are an infestation of roaches. If they remain in the shadows, they will be crushed beneath the rubble of a city that we bring down on their heads. If they face us in open battle, well, then we'll have a good laugh."
- Golgari. "Hermits and under-dwellers. They see that civilization must be brought to its knees, but they just want to replace it with another of their design."
- Izzet. "Like us, they respect the powerful. But they seek it in their gadgets and try to contain it in jars."
- Orzhov. "The schemers of the Orzhov are the festering wound on a limb that must be hacked away. They amass their power by preying on the weak, so how powerful can they be?"
- Rakdos. "The guild of fools. They waste their potential on acts of mockery while the real work of razing the city remains undone."
- Selesnya. "The Selesnya would coddle a wolf, teach it to fetch sticks, and call it a dog. We prefer to starve the wolf, let it hunt for its food, and make it a stronger wolf."
- Simic. "The Simic enjoy twisting nature, but they will not enjoy it when nature twists back."

# IZZET LEAGUE

THE IZZET MAGES WEREN'T HARD TO FIND. AFTER A couble of days of observation. Jace heard an explosion and saw a startled flight of birds from across the district. The plume of blue smoke was a telltale sign of one of the Izzet's pyrotechnic experiments. Jace tracked the source of the blast and spied two mages, a human and a goblin, outfitted with alchemical gadgetry and mizzium gauntlets. They emerged from a disused tunnel, leaving behind charred bricks and a haze of smoke, and their instruments crackled with energy. From what Jace had gathered, this was the Izzet style of research: keep adding energy until something blows up, then observe the results.

-Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

The Izzet are obsessive experimenters, combining a keen creative intellect with a short attention span. The original mandate of the Izzet guild was to provide solutions for public works projects (sewers, boilers, and roadways), but their increasingly far-fetched experiments satisfy only their insatiable curiosity. Sometimes their experiments yield useful technological advancements; other times they produce unintended mana geysers, spatial rifts, arcane portals, or huge explosionsall of which can be useful in their own way.

The league's most grandiose experiments typically concern public works projects and elemental experimentation. These efforts use a methodology that relies on unexpected outcomes: all results are informative, even if they completely defy expectations. For example, an experiment that begins as the creation of a "hypermana focusing lens" might be renamed a "scram-range teleportal" once the researchers discover more properties of what they have fashioned. Then, after a few goblin volunteers vanish inside it, the apparatus gains the designation of "universal refuse disintegrator"-until the goblin volunteers are discovered alive, having been

teleported far from the workshop. This sort of adjustment is par for the course in Izzet experiments; the "fiddle and find out" method is favored over any process of systematic scientific research.

The Izzet League is one of the few guilds whose founder, the dragon Niv-Mizzet, remains its guildmaster, just as the guild continues to fulfill its original mission (even as its experiments go far beyond the guild's original mandate).

# INSIDE THE LEAGUE

Niv-Mizzet, the original and current guildmaster of the Izzet League, is a fifteen-thousand-year-old, vain, temperamental, super-intelligent dragon. As he directs experiments throughout the guild, he values results over success, accepting and even anticipating that Izzet experiments will end in gloriously unpredictable ways. However, the dragon rarely concerns himself with the day-to-day running of the guild, preferring to craft longrange plans and let underlings implement the details.

Overseeing the daily operations of the guild is the purview of the Izmundi, a board of directors that assembles teams from among the rank and file of the Izzet League to carry out research according to Niv-Mizzet's directions. The Izmagnus is a smaller board with five to seven members (some members' identities remain secret) who serve as Niv-Mizzet's closest advisors.

#### IN THE NAME OF MAGICAL SCIENCE!

Izzet laboratories buzz with creative and often destructive energy, as countless researchers go about their business pushing the boundaries of knowledge. But the lure of discovery is anything but monolithic across the Izzet League.

Humans, who make up the majority of the guild's mages, are fueled by limitless curiosity and sustained by their ability to approach any problem from a multitude of different angles.

Goblins embody the Izzet's unrestrained enthusiasm for their endeavors. They epitomize the recklessness of Izzet mages, and some participate as subjects in hazardous experiments-even ones of their own devising. More often, they thrive in their role as attendants to researchers.

Vedalken tend to be more focused, organized, and astute compared to their Izzet compatriots, and thus they often serve as leaders of projects in the guild's laboratories. Some vedalken are so obsessive about their work that they like to see to every detail themselves, rather than delegating any task to underlings or assistants. This attitude can irritate and alienate their guild mates-and put the vedalken in harm's way when an experiment goes awry.

The Izzet League is organized into units designated as laboratories that specialize in certain fields of research. Though they all operate under the general guidance of the Izmundi, each laboratory is typically left alone to conduct its research. New fields of study emerge all the time, but the more established laboratories-each populated by hundreds of mages and their attendants-include the following:

- The Laboratory of Pyrology has a prominent facility in the guildhall, Nivix. Its emphasis is on heat, fire, and explosion.
- The Laboratory of Storms and Electricity focuses on controlling the weather as well as containing and conducting electrical energy. Its headquarters is in a spire atop Nivix, known as the Lightning Rod.
- Research into smelting and forging, most often using the magical metal known as mizzium, is conducted at the Laboratory of Metallurgy, which has a small outpost in the Tenth District's Smelting Quarter.
- The magical science of transmuting one substance to another is the study of the Laboratory of Alchemy.
- The Laboratory of Orientation, concerned with teleportation and spatial recombination, has multiple workshops that seem to appear and disappear at random.
- The Laboratory of Mimeography studies means of duplication.
- The Laboratory of Continuism emphasizes the study of temporal manipulation.
- Research into counter-magic and redirection takes place in the Laboratory of Arcane Geometry, which has a small presence in Prism University in the Tenth District.
- The Laboratory of Gravitational Inversion conducts research on means of flight and maintains a workshop near Augustin Station in the Tenth District.
- The Laboratory of Plasma-Dermatology places emphasis on the combining of opposing elements, with the purpose of creating creatures called weirds.

Izzet laboratories function in a constant state of high energy that propels researchers from one experiment to the next. Some grand-scale experiments draw on the resources of an entire laboratory, while others are a lone visionary's labor of love.

### GOALS OF THE IZZET

The Izzet League thirsts for knowledge, cherishes intellect, and speculates about the secrets of the multiverse. It brings to its scientific pursuits a flaming passion that turns its search for knowledge into an insatiable hunger, makes its cold intellect brilliantly fruitful, and widens its speculation into a search for connections between wildly disparate objects or concepts. It is manic in its expressions of creative energy, shifting from careful analysis to intuitive leap seemingly for no reason, always thinking outside the proverbial box. As the Izzet see it, unpredictable action, far from being antithetical to methodical research, has experimental value. In the words of one researcher, "The only action worth taking is one with an unknown outcome."

As Ravnica descends into increasing turmoil, the Izzet have further intensified their frenetic research, though now their efforts are mainly directed toward one

outcome: the development of super-weapons. The suspicion that festers in the mind of the Izzet guildmaster, the ancient dragon Niv-Mizzet, urges him to push his guild's research toward increasingly dangerous and volatile experimentation.

For the rest of the guild members, the search for bigger and better weapons is mainly an opportunity to engage in all sorts of wild research while abandoning all outward pretense of safety or reason. Much of the guild's laboratory space has been converted into testing grounds that are capable of withstanding great discharges of magical energy.

# IZZET CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually chaotic, often neutral Suggested Races: Human, goblin, vedalken Suggested Classes: Fighter, sorcerer, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Izzet League for any of the following reasons:

- · You like to make things happen and don't care about the consequences.
- · You're drawn to wild magic and dangerous explosions.
- · You want to be an innovative genius.
- · You relish the madcap high jinks of goblins.

### JOINING THE IZZET LEAGUE

Most Izzet recruits begin their careers as attendants. In the service of a more powerful mage, a crew of up to forty attendants engages in tasks such as recording and organizing information (sometimes under dangerous circumstances), acquiring rare items or elements (usually under dangerous circumstances), or completing experiments (always under dangerous circumstances). Goblins relish this sort of work, while other folk seek promotion into a new position as quickly as possible.

If you are a spellcaster, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, the easiest way up and out of your position is by proving your skill with magic. Most Izzet sorcerers get their magic from the Wild Magic origin, but a few claim a Draconic Bloodline. Izzet wizards tend to specialize in the School of Conjuration, Evocation, or Transmutation. As an Izzet spellcaster, you are probably connected to a particular laboratory, either one described in the "Inside the Izzet" section or a less prominent one focused on a narrower topic. You could be an independent researcher, a functionary devoted to carrying out errands for the guild's leadership, or a coordinator charged with synchronizing the efforts of different laboratories.

Even though the work of the Izzet League is largely focused on magic and research, if you are a more martial-minded character you still have a role to play in the guild. Fighters with the Eldritch Knight archetype often serve as guards, protecting laboratories and the inventions contained within them, or you can aspire to the elite role of scorchbringer (which comes with a flame-throwing magic device called a pyroconverger, described in chapter 5).

### BACKGROUND: IZZET ENGINEER

Armed with an inventive intellect, a love of magical technology, and an unquenchable energy, you are an enthusiastic participant in the research work of the Izzet League. Though you're likely to begin your career as a mere attendant, you can aspire to become a skilled mage or alchemist, a laboratory supervisor, or even a flamethrower-wielding scorchbringer tasked with defending Izzet laboratories. The Izzet are obsessive, brilliant, inspired, and an unpredictable force of chaos in Ravnica, and you epitomize all of those qualities.

Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Investigation Languages: Choose one of Draconic, Goblin, or Vedalken

Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools Equipment: An Izzet insignia, one set of artisan's tools, the charred and twisted remains of a failed experiment, a hammer, a block and tackle, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp (Azorius l-zino coins)

#### FEATURE: URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE

The popular conception of the Izzet League is based on mad inventions, dangerous experiments, and explosive blasts. Much of that perception is accurate, but the league is also involved with mundane tasks of construction and architecture-primarily in crafting the infrastructure that allows Ravnicans to enjoy running water, levitating platforms, and other magical and technological wonders.

You have a basic knowledge of the structure of buildings, including the stuff behind the walls. You can also find blueprints of a specific building in order to learn the details of its construction. Such blueprints might provide knowledge of entry points, structural weaknesses, or secret spaces. Your access to such information isn't unlimited. If obtaining or using the information gets you in trouble with the law, the guild can't shield you from the repercussions.

#### IZZET GUILD SPELLS

Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on the Izzet Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

#### IZZET GUILD SPELLS

| Spell Level Spells |  |
| --- | --- |
| Cantrip | produce flame, shocking grasp |
| 1st | chaos bolt, create or destroy water, |
|  | unseen servant |
| 2nd | heat metal, rope trick |
| 3rd | call lightning, elemental weapon, |
|  | glyph of warding |
| 4th | conjure minor elementals, divination, |
|  | Otiluke's resilient sphere |
| 5th | animate objects, conjure elemental |

Your spells tend to be loud, flashy, or explosive, even when the effect is unremarkable. For example, when you open the portal of a rope trick spell, the portal might be outlined by harmless, showy sparkles.

If you use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets, glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attaching it to your body. The mizzium apparatus described in chapter 5 is a magical version of this gear.

The chaos bolt spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters because of its unpredictable nature.

#### SPELL: CHAOS BOLT 1st-level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet Components: V. S Duration: Instantaneous

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

| d8 |
| --- |
| Damage Type |

- l Acid
- 2 Cold
- 3 Fire
- 4 Force
- 5 Lightning 6 Poison
- 
- 7 Psychic 8 Thunder

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by this casting of the spell.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

#### SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

Members of the Izzet League embody some combination of chaotic, frenetic energy with intellectual curiosity, in varving proportions. Some are committed to academic pursuits, and others just like explosions.

#### PERSONALITY TRAITS

#### d8 Personality Trait

DAM PAQUETT

#### IDEALS

#### de Ideal

- Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) l
- 2 Creativity. Half the world's troubles come from stodgy thinking, stuck in the past. We need innovative solutions. (Chaotic)
- 3 Discovery. Every experiment has the potential to reveal more secrets of the multiverse. (Any)
- 4 Science. A rigorous application of logical principles and protocols will lead us toward progress more surely than any belief system. (Lawful)
- 5 Fun. I love my job! Despite the dangerous working conditions, there's nothing I'd rather do. (Chaotic)
- 6 Power. Someday I'll find or create the magic that will make me the most powerful being in Ravnica. (Evil)

#### BONDS

- de Bond
- I have dedicated my life to finding a solution to a l scientific problem.
- 2 I'll never forget the laboratory where I learned my skills, or the other attendants who learned alongside me.
- 3 I'm convinced it was sabotage that destroyed my first laboratory and killed many of my friends, and I seek revenge against whoever did it.
- 4 I have the schematics for an invention that I hope to build one day, once I have the necessary resources.
- 5 A fellow student and I are racing to solve the same scientific puzzle.

- 5 I'm convinced there's not a soul in Ravnica, except maybe the great Niv-Mizzet, who can match my boundless intellect.
- 6 I'm incapable of admitting a flaw in my logic.

#### CONTACTS

The laboratories of the Izzet League are constantly starting up new projects and dissolving old ones, so it's easy for even the lowliest attendant to make friends (and enemies) in laboratories across Ravnica.

Roll twice on the Izzet Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Izzet Contacts table.

#### IZZET CONTACTS

#### 98 Contact

- 2 I know a sprite who carries important messages among the guild's laboratories.
- 3 A sibling is the head of a laboratory doing exotic research.
- 4 A former colleague is now an attendant in a laboratory in the central guildhall.

- 9 A former attendant from the same laboratory ran off to join the Selesnya, and we get into a big argument every time we run into each other.
- 10 I compare notes and techniques with a Simic scientist over lunch sometimes.

### How Do I Fit In?

Whatever your role in the Izzet League, you are expected to contribute to its research in some way. That contribution might involve participating in tests, whether as an assistant, a researcher, or a subject. You might be one of the soldiers who protects a laboratory, or a laborer responsible for lifting heavy pieces of equipment into place. Everyone's contribution matters, even if the Izzet know that some matter more than others.

#### AN IZZET PARTY

A party made up entirely of Izzet members might be a mage (wizard or sorcerer) accompanied by guards (fighters) and attendants (any class). The structure of the guild generally assumes that the mage is in charge of steering the group, but it's possible for any of the other characters to be the true brains of the operation. This party lacks healing ability, but alchemist-crafted healing potions can help sustain the party in the absence of a dedicated healer.

#### RANK AND RENOWN

Renown within the Izzet League brings with it more responsibility in your chosen field of study, as well as an increasing ability to choose the activities that interest you. This greater responsibility and independence is reflected in a progression of ranks, from that of a mere attendant to a coveted position on the Izmagnus.

#### RANK 1: RESEARCHER

#### Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Izzet League, Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

When you have advanced the guild's interests and survived a few magical experiments, you graduate into a position where you can conduct experiments yourself. Only a spellcaster can craft and operate the laboratory equipment involved in Izzet experiments.

As a researcher, you can request equipment for use in your experiments and during adventures. You can secure the aid of 1d4 barely competent attendants to assist you. Your attendants use the commoner stat block in the Monster Manual.

When you achieve this rank, you can help create your own mizzium apparatus (described in chapter 5). To do so, you must spend 10 days of downtime in an Izzet workshop, assisting a more experienced researcher in the construction of the device. The apparatus is given to you at the end of this time. If your apparatus is lost or destroyed, you can create a replacement by spending 50 gp and another 10 days of downtime.

#### SCORCHBRINGER (SPECIAL ROLE)

#### Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Izzet League

Scorchbringers are soldiers assigned to protect Izzet laboratories. As a scorchbringer, you are given a pyroconverger (described in chapter 5) and are expected to use it in the defense of Izzet property. If your pyroconverger is lost or destroyed, you can get a replacement for 50 gp.

#### RANK 2: SUPERVISOR

#### Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Izzet League

Whether you're an accomplished researcher, a committed soldier, or even a dedicated (and skilled) attendant, vou are eligible for promotion to a supervisor position. As a supervisor, you oversee your former peers. Your role is primarily to translate the instructions of the director above you into concrete tasks that the people who report to you can accomplish.

If your director sends you on a mission outside the laboratory, you receive an Izzet charm (described in chapter 5) at the start of that mission.

As a supervisor, you earn a salary sufficient to maintain a modest lifestyle.

#### INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Izzet League, Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

Not every researcher chooses to advance through the ranks of management to become a supervisor. As an independent researcher, you can use the resources of your laboratory to conduct any kind of experiment. Assisting you in your research are 2d6 competent attendants (use the commoner stat block in the Monster Manual, and give them proficiency in the Arcana skill).

In addition, you can create your own Izzet charm (described in chapter 5), given 5 days of work and access to your laboratory. When you do so, any other charms you have created vanish.

#### RANK 3: DIRECTOR

#### Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in the Izzet League

You oversee a laboratory and all its personnel. In addition, as a director, you are eligible to join the Izmundi, the Izzet board of directors, as a representative of your laboratory. You must have the approval of Niv-Mizzet, and a position on this board usually becomes available only if a vacancy opens up. If you assemble your own laboratory, you can be added to the board as an additional member.

It's up to the Izmundi to assemble the correct team to carry out the guildmaster's directives. The Izmundi decides which laboratory should have primary responsibility for any given project, and the director of that laboratory is responsible for assigning people to the team.

Within the bounds of Niv-Mizzet's directives, you have wide latitude in directing the activities of your laboratory. That means you can steer the researchers of your laboratory toward the creation of particular items or effects.

Between adventures, you can maintain yourself at a comfortable lifestyle as a member of the Izmundi.

#### RANK 4: ADVISOR

#### Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the Izzet League

As one of the most famous members of the guild, you are eligible to join the ranks of the Izmagnus. The decision to include you on this board is solely Niv-Mizzet's. The number of members on the board isn't fixed, so you don't need to wait for a vacancy.

As a member of the Izmagnus, you have the ear of the dragon guildmaster. You can never be fully aware of the scope of his plans, but you know more about them than anyone aside from the other members of the board. The guildmaster listens to your opinion, even though you're not an ancient dragon with thousands of years of accumulated knowledge and wisdom. Ultimately, Niv-Mizzet tells you what to do-and you (along with your peers) tell the rest of the guild how to do it.

As a member of the Izmagnus, you can maintain yourself at a wealthy lifestyle between adventures.

#### ENEMIES AND ALLIES

The Izzet have difficulty relating to the concerns of other guilds. The closest affinity they feel for another guild is their respect for the scientific minds of the Simic-but from the Izzet viewpoint, the Simic efforts lack passion. Conversely, the Izzet can appreciate the passion of the Boros, Gruul, and Rakdos, but they don't agree with the goals those passions are directed toward.

The Izzet have a reputation for unprovoked aggression, spurred by the ambition of Niv-Mizzet. From your perspective as a guild member, the ancient dragon has a good reason for everything he does. If you are sent to test a new weapon against a suspected Dimir safe house, a Gruul camp, or a deceptively peaceful Selesnya enclave, those must surely be dangerous foes of the Izzet. You are also bound to oppose the Dimir when they steal the secrets of your laboratory's research, the Gruul when they smash the delicate equipment that supports your life's work, and the Boros and the Azorius if they decide that your work presents a danger to the city or breaks some obscure law.

Sometimes members of other guilds can help advance your research, intentionally or otherwise. The Izzet are intelligent enough to recognize their weaknesses, and adventuresome souls from other guilds can offset those weaknesses. The healing spells of Boros clerics can be an invaluable aid, and if a cyclops isn't available to lend its brute strength to your work, a Boros minotaur or a Selesnya centaur can fill the need nicely.

#### THE IZZET VIEW ON OTHER GUILDS

To the lively intellect of the Izzet, the members of Ravnica's other guilds seem slow, dull, and utterly lacking in the spirit of scientific inquiry and experimentation.

- Azorius. "The Azorius create regulations for everything, including freedom. What dull, shackled lives they lead."
- Boros. "All too often when we're on the verge of setting off a little explosion or a spell that tears a hole in reality, the Boros show up to spoil the fun."
- Dimir. "The less we see of the Dimir, the more we know they are monitoring us."
- Golgari. "They keep to themselves and clean up our messes. As long as they stay out of sight, it's hard to view them as a threat."
- Gruul. "They're even better at wrecking our laboratories than we are!"
- Orzhov. "Progress means taking risks. But when you gamble with the Orzhov, you always wager more than coin."
- Rakdos. "Steer clear of these senseless riot-fiends. Their enthusiasm is best appreciated from a distance."
- Selesnya. "These zealots run with beasts and worship figments of the past. They would be wiser to embrace the wonders of the future."
- Simic. "The Simic are inventive, but their creations are bereft of soul and fire. They tinker with life but lack the inspiration to breathe true spirit into their inventions."

# ORZHOV SYNDICATE

REPRESENTING THE ORZHOV WAS A TALL, WELL-DRESSED noblewoman Jace didn't recognize. The identities of the Orzhov knights around her were concealed by full helmets; instead of faces they bore only the Orzhov's black sunburst symbol. Small, ugly, gray-skinned servant creatures attended to their black capes.

-Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

Wealth is power, and you absolutely can take it with you if you're an undying spirit living in decadent luxury on the ruling council of the Orzhov Syndicate. Built on the crushed dreams and broken bodies of citizens deeply indebted to the syndicate's banks and loan sharks, Orzhov's elaborate hierarchy of syndics, priests, and oligarchs exists for the single purpose of funneling wealth to the top. Beneath the twin facades of religious hierarchy and banking operation, Orzhov is an organized crime syndicate with its fingers in businesses across the city.

The Orzhov's original function was both religious and financial, with the two functions closely related. As Ravnica's dominant church, the Orzhov continues to preach an oppressive message that equates sin with debt and promises forgiveness to those who make tithes and donations. As Ravnica's principal bank, it stores and secures the riches of the city, collecting interest at high rates to expand its own wealth. Its members truly believe that their work is necessary to the proper functioning of Ravnica. Although most other Ravnicans see the Orzhov for the corrupt organization it is, many people are still dazzled by the syndicate's promises of wealth, prestige, and longevity.

The Ghost Council, also called the Obzedat, that leads the Orzhov founded the guild and signed the Guildpact, but it isn't clear which members of the original Obzedat might have faded from existence since then and which current members have joined since.

# INSIDE THE SYNDICATE

The Orzhov are ruled by the iron-fisted Obzedat, a council consisting of the oldest and most powerful undead oligarchs. A vast hierarchy stretches out beneath them, so most of your interactions with the leadership of the guild are with people (or spirits) who occupy the rank just above yours. This hierarchy has corruption in it at every level, and at any time your superiors might be passing instructions down from on high or just using you to pursue their own agendas of greed and ambition.

Orzhov churches and basilicas are scattered across the city, each one led by a ministrant with a staff of knights and syndics. These sites are centers of commerce clothed in the trappings of religion, where lowly borrowers come to seek atonement for their sins-atonement that is given in the form of debt and obligation.

Orzhov attorneys and advokists maintain offices near New Prahv and other Azorius courts. Despite their proximity to law enforcement, these offices are centers of operation for Orzhov protection rackets and other criminal activities.

#### GOALS OF THE ORZHOV

The Orzhov Syndicate is dedicated to the quest for power. It sees the value in an organized, structured, law-abiding community, because it is adept at exploiting laws and structures for its own gain. It sees itself, in a perfect world, as the arbiter and enforcer of a social order that keeps everyone in their place and the Orzhov in the highest place.

Increasing tensions in Ravnica have led to an atmosphere of instability, and to counter this, the Orzhov Syndicate promises the trappings of a stable, ordered life amid the chaos-for a price. The Orzhov believe that adherence to hierarchy is the key to success, and they find great comfort in the rigid structure of their guild.

To boost their declining profits in a vacillating economy, the Orzhov have begun offering protection services, promising to shield their "customers" from both physical harm and fiscal disaster. These operations amount to racketeering, bringing with them the underlying threat that those who refuse to pay for protection become targets of the Orzhov's thugs and enforcers.

The Azorius are the greatest threat to Orzhov's operations. In times past, the Orzhov danced along the edges of the law and presented an appearance of legality, but the combination of an ever-expanding legal code and the guild's move into racketeering and other explicitly illegal activities has made it vulnerable to Azorius enforcement. So far, the Azorius have demonstrated more interest in cracking down on the chaotic activity of the Gruul and the Rakdos, but Azorius arresters also routinely shut down Orzhov protection rackets and take enforcers into custody. To make matters worse, the Azorius Senate's increasing use of precognitive magic is proving difficult for the Orzhov to work around.

So far, the syndicate's most effective tactic has been to increase the layers of separation between the day-today criminal operations of the guild and the leadership, ensuring that no matter how many street-level thugs and syndics are apprehended to fill the Azorius prisons, the guild's leadership remains intact. Contact between the oligarchs and lower-ranking members of the guild is increasingly rare in this situation, and even the pontiffs find it ever more difficult to arrange a hearing with their superiors.

# ORZHOV CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually lawful, often evil Suggested Races: Human Suggested Classes: Cleric, fighter, rogue, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Orzhov Syndicate if any of the following sentences are true:

- · You want to move through the corrupt underbelly of society and make respectable people squirm in your presence.
- · You enjoy playing fearsome or decadent characters.
- · You want to strive for wealth, lavish beauty, or both.

### JOINING THE ORZHOV SYNDICATE

At the beginning of your association with the Orzhov. you are regarded as a borrower. Whether you are the wealthy scion of an oligarch family or a penniless citizen deep in debt to the guild, your status is functionally equivalent: you owe everything you have, even your life. to the Orzhov. Your only hope of improving your status is through your service to the guild. As you acquire renown, you can rise above this debased position in the guild hierarchy. Choose one of three parallel tracks of advancement, depending on your capabilities: advokist, enforcer, or priest.

#### ADVOKIST

If you are a spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Abjuration, Divination, or Enchantment), you can aspire to be an advokist-one of the syndicate's lawyers, with duties that include overseeing contracts, representing clients in Azorius courts, and prosecuting those who fail to pay their debts. Some clerics of the Order Domain also choose to pursue this path.

Many advokists draw on the power of law magic to enforce regulations and contracts to the advantage of the guild. They use their magic to draw out the truth from debtors and those who dare to break their contracts with the guild, to ensure that petitioners approach with the proper humility, and to punish those who offend them or violate their contracts. Some advokists (particularly specialists in the School of Abjuration) also deal in encrypting texts, warding vaults and secret meeting rooms, fortifying structures, and cloaking important personages in magical protections.

#### ENFORCER

Enforcers guard Orzhov property and protect the guild's bureaucrats, administrators, and aristocrats. You might be the muscle who collects protection money and debt payments from the syndicate's clients, or an assassin. (euphemistically called a euthanist) who brings speedy ends to lives deemed to have gone on too long. Most Orzhov enforcers are fighters. Rogue enforcers typically emulate the Thief or Assassin archetype.

#### PRIEST

If you are cleric (most likely of the Order Domain), you can aspire to serve an important function in the Orzhov Syndicate, which continues to maintain the outward appearance of a religious institution. Once you earn a position of respect in the syndicate, you will hear confessions and dole out penance (which is always of a financial nature). Your "calling" centers on collecting monetary tithes and offerings in a wide range of forms. Your spellcasting ability comes from the collective power of the spirits that rule the guild, not from a god.

You might even be a most unusual priest for the syndicate-one who thinks the guild's wealth should be used to ease the suffering of the downtrodden. You might also believe in the inspiration and delight that beautiful pageantry can offer to the world. If you seek to distribute wealth and share beauty, rather than hoard them, you must do so discreetly to avoid the ire of the Obzedat.

#### BACKGROUND: ORZHOV REPRESENTATIVE

The prospect of immense wealth is the promise of membership in the Orzhov Syndicate. All of the guild's endeavors channel wealth from Ravnican society into the ranks of the Orzhov-and concentrates the spoils at the top of the hierarchy. As a functionary in that system, your best hope is to claim as much as possible of the money that passes through your hands on its way up, so that you can work your way into a more prominent position.

Regardless of your past and the wealth of your family, your initial status with the guild is near the bottom, until you have proven your value.

Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Religion

Languages: Two of your choice

- Equipment: An Orzhov insignia, a foot-long chain made of ten gold coins, vestments, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 1 pp (an Orzhov-minted 10-zino coin)
#### FEATURE: LEVERAGE

You can exert leverage over one or more individuals below you in the guild's hierarchy and demand their help as needs warrant. For example, you can have a message carried across a neighborhood, procure a short carriage ride without paying, or have others clean up a

bloody mess you left in an alley. The DM decides if your demands are reasonable and if there are subordinates available to fulfill them. As your status in the guild improves, you gain influence over more people, including ones in greater positions of power.

#### ORZHOV GUILD SPELLS

#### Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on the Orzhov Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

#### ORZHOV GUILD SPELLS

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| Cantrip | friends, guidance |
| 1st | command, illusory script |
| 2nd | enthrall, ray of enfeeblement, zone of truth |
| 3rd | bestow curse, speak with dead, spirit guardians |
| 4th | blight, death ward, Leomund's secret chest |
| 5th | geas |

Your magic tends to manifest as swirling shadows, brilliant light, or sometimes the momentary appearance of shadowy spirit forms. Your spells might draw the blood of your enemies, or even directly touch their souls.

#### SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

Members of the Orzhov Syndicate range from the decadent nobility at the top of the oligarchy to the debt-ridden wretches at the bottom. You fall somewhere between those extremes, so you might behave with the arrogance of the very rich or the humility of the impoverished.

#### CONTACTS

The Orzhov Syndicate operates according to a strict hierarchy built on a network of connections among old, wealthy families. Your family might provide important contacts, while your family's activities in crime, banking, or debt collection could tie you to members of other guilds.

Roll twice on the Orzhov Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Orzhov Contacts table.

### How Do I Fit In?

The structure of the Orzhov Syndicate means that you are always doing the bidding of someone higher up the ladder than you are. Ultimately, your role in the guild is defined by whatever the people (and spirits) above you decide for you.

For most of your career, you can expect to engage in some aspect of the day-to-day criminal operations of the guild. That can mean throwing your weight around to enforce the will of the guild or using religious authority to extort offerings from the people. But it can also mean doing various errands for your superiors, from bearing messages to carrying out assassinations.

#### AN ORZHOV PARTY

An Orzhov adventuring party might be assembled in one of two ways. If its primary purpose is the application of brute force, some number of hulking enforcers (fighters) form the core of the ground, perhaps supported by a

stealthy "euthanist" (rogue) and a knight (paladin). A priest (cleric) could provide additional magical support.

If the group is more focused on the political scheming of the Orzhov, involving the use of persuasion and coercion rather than outright force, a priest (cleric) and an advokist (wizard) will probably lead the group, accompanied by more sophisticated bodyguards (fighters or rogues).

### RANK AND RENOWN

The Orzhov adhere to a very strict power structure. Positions open only at the bottom of the organization, and rising through the ranks requires utmost devotion. With increasing rank comes a greater degree of leverage over those who occupy the ranks below you.

#### RANK 1: SYNDIC

#### Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Orzhov Syndicate

Syndics are low-ranking functionaries. At this level of the hierarchy, you can expect deference from borrowers, who will perform small favors that require no significant risk, effort, or cost. The bulk of your work for the guild, in turn, involves doing favors for those above you.

As a priest of this rank, you can perform minor tasks in an Orzhov church: collecting tithes at the door, scheduling appointments for the senior priests, keeping ledgers, and the like. As an advokist, you copy documents, research legal precedent, depose witnesses, and otherwise assist more senior guild members. As an enforcer, you flex your muscle to collect minor debts that are of little importance to the guild as a whole.

# RANK 2: KNIGHT

Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Orzhov Syndicate

Each knight carries a title that expresses a quality of character, such as Knight of Penance or Knight of Despair. As a knight, you have authority over syndics, and you are trusted-so far as anyone in the Orzhov Syndicate trusts anyone else-to transport large sums of money. You also have access to sufficient funds to maintain a comfortable lifestyle between adventures.

As a priest of this rank, you hear confessions and collect penance, lead rites (and take offerings), perform ceremonies, and offer counsel to your superiors when asked. As an advokist, you represent clients in court, draw up contracts, and put your magic to use in a variety of ways. As an enforcer, you are entrusted with collecting larger sums and interacting with powerful clients.

When you're sent on a mission that poses a potential threat, your superior bestows on you an Orzhov charm (described in chapter 5). In addition, you have the authority to demand service from borrowers, including indentured spirits (see chapter 6 for the stat block). But that's an authority you must use sparingly, since their service counts as credit to their debt, and it's in the guild's interest to keep borrowers in debt.

#### RANK 3: MINISTRANT

Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the Orzhov Syndicate

The rank of ministrant is the highest position anyone can hope to attain without being born into the guild. As a ministrant, you study finance, while managing the

syndics and knights under your control. Between adventures, you can now maintain a wealthy lifestyle.

You are given a servitor thrull (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that is yours to command. If it is killed, your pontiff gives you a new one at their discretion, possibly up to 1d4 weeks later. You also have a staff of 2d4 knights and 4d8 syndics under your command. You can order them only to carry out tasks that contribute to the work your pontiff assigns to you. The duty of protecting you from physical harm is always appropriate service for your knights, however. Your knights can be knights or priests, and your syndics are either nobles or acolytes (stat blocks for them appear in the Monster Manual).

#### RANK 4: PONTIFF

#### Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the Orzhov Syndicate, Orzhov birth

As a pontiff, you are one of the executive managers in charge of enacting the will of the Ghost Council. For that purpose, you have a staff of 2d6 ministrants (use the mage or priest stat blocks from the Monster Manual to represent them), with their attendant knights and syndics as described for rank 3. You have access to 2d4 servitor thrulls and winged thrulls (see chapter 6 for these stat blocks) at any given time, to carry messages and perform menial tasks for you. You also gain the occasional privilege of speaking with members of the Obzedat. Between adventures, you can maintain an aristocratic lifestyle.

#### ENEMIES AND ALLIES

A syndicate built on a foundation of exploitation and extortion can't rely on alliances. The Orzhov appreciate certain aspects of other guilds' work and missions, but they treat other guilds as resources to be plundered. In general, the Orzhov view guilds that promote order and stability (Azorius, Boros, and Selesnya) more kindly than guilds that sow chaos and destruction (such as Golgari and Rakdos).

Sometimes adherence to order can get in the way of an efficient crime operation, though, and that's when the Orzhov part ways with the other law-and-order guildsespecially the Azorius. Any guild that obstructs the Orzhov from amassing more wealth is an enemy, whether the disruption comes from horning in on Orzhov operations or enforcing laws against racketeering.

The best way to secure individual allies from other guilds is to make them owe you something. Borrowers seldom make friendly or especially loyal allies, but they can be useful pawns. You might form a genuine alliance with members of other guilds if you share a common enemy: the overreaching Azorius or Boros, the spies of the Dimir or assassins of the Golgari, or the rampages and excesses of the Gruul and Rakdos. Alternatively, you might team up with members of a chaotic guild to bring down an opponent that is causing too much trouble for Orzhov operations.

#### THE ORZHOV VIEW ON OTHER GUILDS

In the eyes of the Orzhov Syndicate, the other guilds primarily represent either opportunities for exploitation or dangerous threats to its way of life.

- Azorius. "Their new laws challenge everything we know Ravnica stands for. If they will not protect the people, then we will do it for them."
- Boros. "Though their structure is reasonable, they are naive in their outlook on justice. What glory is there in risking one's life when work continues in the afterlife?"
- Dimir. "It's hard to begrudge them their love of secrets. As long as they stay out of our business, we will leave them be."
- Golgari. "Admirably resourceful and elegant, but tragically unhygienic. The swarmers may persist, as long as they don't try to force their aesthetic sensibilities on us."
- Gruul. "They know nothing of order and dignity, and therefore they serve little purpose as an organization."
- Izzet. "Combative and obnoxious. Their allegiance lies with no one, and their naiveté isn't worth our time."
- Rakdos. "A necessary source of creativity and satire. Wit is a dangerous weapon, and their critiques speak to the people more than fear and surveillance ever will."
- Selesnya. "The Selesnya are idealistic fools. Looking toward nature ignores the problems at hand in the civilized world."
- Simic. "Their preoccupation with life disregards the might that death can provide."

# CULT OF RAKDOS

JACE WALKED INTO THE RAKDOS CLUB, PUSHING INTO a wall of scents and sounds. The ceilings were surprisingly high inside, draped with banners and spiked chains. An impish creature hooted as it dangled from a high wire while a man in leather chaps swallowed orbs of fire and breathed them back out through his snaggly teeth. Scarred, blackscaled drakes fought viciously in cages that swung from the ceiling, and the stink of sweat and singed flesh wafted from adjoining alcoves. Against the wall stood an enormous sentry. somewhere along the spectrum between rotund man and compact giant, dressed in what looked like the motley of a harlequin jester crossed with barbed wire.

-Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

Tomorrow is an illusion; everything is ridiculous. Members of the Cult of Rakdos have witnessed the grandiose speeches and self-important plans of other guilds and concluded that their rivals take themselves far too seriously. Since death comes for everyone, and since order tends inevitably toward chaos, the Rakdos believe that unrestrained, moment-to-moment hedonism is the only sane way to live. Of course, few other Ravnicans would describe the Rakdos as sane.

The Cult of Rakdos bears the name of the demon lord who founded it. As laid out in the Guildpact, the guild was intended to fill roles concerning entertainment, mining, and manual labor. Some argue that any effort to give a demonic cult a respectable role in society was doomed to failure, but the cult remains part of Ravnica's social fabric nevertheless. The Guildpact prohibits the cult's extermination, and its entertainments-even as dark and destructive as they are-hold broad appeal. From rowdy mobs who love to see the Rakdos skewer the powerful elites to decadent socialites who come to the Rakdos for illicit amusements, most of Ravnica's people don't really want the Rakdos to go away, as much as they might publicly protest otherwise.

# INSIDE THE CULT

As one of Ravnica's original guild founders, the demon Rakdos has been part of Ravnica for millennia. Members of other guilds know Rakdos through his reputation for capricious cruelty and megalomania, but those who join the guild idolize him for his magnetic presence, which inspires art and encourages utter wantonness. Because Rakdos finds destruction entertaining, his cultists incorporate deadly acts into their performances in hopes of catching his eye and earning his favor.

Stages for Rakdos performances appear on streets and plazas throughout Ravnica every night, and they're gone by morning-carried to and fro on the backs of giants. Permanent establishments that cater to dark desires are tucked away in the seediest neighborhoods of the city, such as the Smelting Quarter in Precinct Six of the Tenth District.

#### GOALS OF THE RAKDOS

The Cult of Rakdos is centered on a demon lord who exemplifies the concepts of chaos and evil. At its worst, the cult is driven by a lust for power, extreme selfishness, and a lack of compassion. Cultists take delight in causing pain to others to make sure they know their place, which is subservient to the powerful adherents of this self-centered philosophy.

The cult's chaotic nature fuels its passion, impulsiveness, and obsession with freedom. A guild of unbridled hedonism, it does what it wants, driven by base desires and a strong streak of cruelty.

The Cult of Rakdos was originally recognized as a guild as part of an effort to channel the impulses of demons, giants, ogres, and humans into an acceptable direction. That effort has never been completely successful. Now, as tension builds in Ravnica and several guilds attempt to crack down on chaos and criminal activity, the Rakdos cult reacts to this building pressure with increasing violence.

The Cult of Rakdos already serves a megalomaniacal demon of chaos, so its members have no interest in seeing any other ambitious figure achieve supreme rulership over Ravnica. They fear that any other guild might gain enough power to overwhelm all the others and impose its own values on everyone. For this reason, they focus their efforts on subverting other guilds' schemes, by undermining popular and powerful leaders

and interfering-often violently-with any effort to build a centralized concentration of authority.

The Azorius Senate currently stands as the greatest threat to the Rakdos way of life. The cult targets Azorius senators and arresters for ridicule, harassment, and occasionally assassination. The Boros Legion's zealous pursuit of order and justice poses a similar threat. Although Boros's attention is focused on the Gruul at the moment, Rakdos cultists are well aware that any sufficiently disruptive performance with a high enough body count could bring the wrath of the legion down on their heads. The overreaching of the Azorius and the self-righteous wrath of the Boros engender true fear in the anarchic Rakdos cultists, and the Rakdos respond to fear with bloodshed.

# RAKDOS CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually chaotic, often evil Suggested Races: Human, goblin Suggested Classes: Barbarian, bard, fighter, warlock

You might enjoy playing a Rakdos character if any of the following sentences describe you:

- · You enjoy mayhem.
- · You like playing showy, dramatic characters who are often the center of attention.
- · You're drawn to bards or warlocks.
- · The idea of finding a heroic way to participate in a demonic cult sounds like a fun challenge.

#### JOINING THE CULT OF RAKDOS

The Cult of Rakdos attracts misfits and malcontents, who can't abide the civilized norms of Ravnica, as well as wayward souls eager to idolize an ancient demon lord and partake in riots. However, what Ravnicans like most about the guild is that it has evolved into a roving circus that attracts hedonistic, anything-goes performers who really know how to put on a show.

By the time you start your adventuring career, you no doubt have a great act ready to go, and you're champing at the spike-studded bit to get out there and show the world what you've got. But you must earn a place on the stage or in the ring, and that means first doing your part backstage to keep the show running. "Backstage" can also mean "out in the city," carrying out a variety of errands for people who have more pull than you. And with the Rakdos, such errands tend to look more like adventures than like shopping trips.

What does your chosen form of performance look like? What skills do you aspire to learn? Spikewheel acrobats, lampooners, fire jugglers, puppeteers, pain artists, noise musicians, and hellbeast riders form the heart of the cult's bizarre entertainments, putting on shows in guild-owned dark speakeasies and on portable stages in the streets. Performers called uncagers tendand unleash-the variety of beasts and horrors used in Rakdos shows.

Other Rakdos performers are spellcasters of spectacular sort. using expressive, free-wheeling, and dangerous magic. These mages find inspiration in the responses expressed by witnesses of their magic. They can be equally gratified by howls of laughter or howls of horror-any attention, in their minds, is good attention.

Most Rakdos performers are fighters of the Champion or Eldritch Knight archetype, barbarians of the Path of the Berserker, or rogues of the Thief or Assassin archetype. Spellcasting performers are often bards of the College of Valor or warlocks of the fiend (the demon lord Rakdos).

#### BACKGROUND: RAKDOS CULTIST

You're an entertainer at heart, a performer with a flair for the dramatic and a love of the spotlight. You've spent years honing your craft, mastering a demanding set of skills so you can perform them with panache and make them look easy. The wild applause, the screams of the crowds, the mayhem and terror spreading into the streets-this is what you live for.

You're also a member of a cult devoted to an ancient demon who delights in violence and chaos. It just so happens that Rakdos loves a good show, and your highest aspiration is to please the Defiler, the Lord of Riots, with your own performance.

Skill Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Performance Languages: Choose either Abyssal or Giant Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument Equipment: A Rakdos insignia, a musical instrument

(one of your choice), a costume, a hooded lantern made of wrought iron, a 10-foot length of chain with sharply spiked links, a tinderbox, 10 torches, a set of common clothes, a belt pouch containing 10 gp (a mix of Azorius and Boros 1-zino coins), and a bottle of sweet, red juice

#### A FLAIR FOR THE DRAMATIC

Rakdos performance styles typically fuse standard circus-style acrobatics with fire, wrought-iron spikes and hooks, and monsters. You can roll a d8 or choose from i the options in the Performance Options table to determine your preferred style of performance.

#### PERFORMANCE OPTIONS

- Type of Performer d8
- Spikewheel acrobat T
- 2 Lampooning satirist
- 3 Fire juggler
- Marionette puppeteer 4
- 5 Pain artist
- 6 Noise musician
- 7 Nightmare clown
- 8 Master of ceremonies

#### FEATURE: FEARSOME REPUTATION

People recognize you as a member of the Cult of Rakdos, and they're careful not to draw your anger or ridicule. You can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a restaurant or breaking down a door at a local shop, if no legal authorities witness the crime. Most people are too daunted by you to report your wrongdoing to the Azorius.

#### RAKDOS GUILD SPELLS

#### Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on the Rakdos Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

#### RAKDOS GUILD SPELLS

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| Cantrip | fire bolt, vicious mockery |
| 1st | burning hands, dissonant whispers, |
|  | hellish rebuke |
| 2nd | crown of madness, enthrall, flaming sphere |
| 3rd | fear, haste |
| 4th | confusion, wall of fire |
| 5th | dominate person |

Your magic often produces a flashy spectacle, wreathing you or your targets in a mixture of harmless flame and shadowy shapes. When you manipulate an opponent's mind, a flaming symbol of Rakdos might momentarily appear like a mask over the target's face.

#### SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

Members of demonic cults aren't generally known as the kindest or most mentally stable individuals, so you're likely to have something in your nature that distinguishes you from the law-abiding citizens of Ravnica.

#### PERSONALITY TRAITS

#### d8 Personality Trait

- 1 I revel in mayhem, the more destructive the better.
- 2 When violence breaks out, I lose myself in rage, and it's sometimes hard to stop.

- 8 I enjoy breaking delicate works of art. And fingers, which are sort of the same.

#### IDEALS

#### de Ideal

- Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) l

- 3 I throw caution to the wind.
- I resent the rich and powerful. 4
- 5 When I'm angry, I lash out in violence.

#### CONTACTS

The Cult of Rakdos is anything but organized. Individuals frequently move from one performance troupe to another. Almost all members of the cult know former castmates now in different troupes, which allows for the possibility of a widespread network of contacts.

Roll twice on the Rakdos Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Rakdos Contacts table.

#### RAKDOS CONTACTS

#### d8 Contact

- l I was part of a two-person act until my former partner moved to a different troupe.

- 9 A Selesnya healer attends my performances regularly.
- 10 A Simic biomancer provides mutant monsters to add a taste of the bizarre to our shows.

#### How Do I FIT IN?

The Cult of Rakdos encourages independent action on the part of its members. Its goal is fomenting chaos, and it firmly believes in putting its own house in disorder before carrying that mission into the larger city. So your role is to execute your vision of grand satire and disruptive performance art, as you aspire to outdo your guild mates and attract the attention of Rakdos himself.

You work as part of a troupe, with your artistic talents used in service to a ringmaster's vision. But your performance is your own, and no one expects you to follow a script. In fact, if you go through a performance without doing something you haven't done before, you're clearly not trying hard enough.

#### A RAKDOS PARTY

LATE

A Rakdos adventuring party could operate as a performance troupe, performing a variety of activities under the cover of its nighttime shows. The master of ceremonies (bard) is the public face of the troupe, with a number of performers (fighters, barbarians, rogues, or warlocks) doing their own unique acts. A blood witch (warlock) might take the place of a spellcasting performer or assume the role of the master of ceremonies.

#### RANK AND RENOWN

The anarchic nature of the Cult of Rakdos-aside from the absolute rulership of Rakdos himself-makes rank a meaningless concept to the members of the guild. Nevertheless, renown matters: performers who are well known within the guild also tend to be well known outside the guild, which means larger audiences. Renown in the Cult of Rakdos is the difference between being a bit player in someone else's performance and being the ringmaster of your own show.

#### EXTRA

#### Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos

You have proven yourself both useful and talented and have earned a place on stage. It's a small place, and a dangerous one-bit players like you are as likely to suffer injury or death during a Rakdos performance as audience members are. But that's the thrill of live theater!

#### SIDESHOW ACT Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos

You have gained a reputation both within the Cult of Rakdos and (to some extent) outside it, though you are still a long way from achieving top billing. You might stage performances in back alleys and abandoned warehouses, with a handful of other performers helping to bring your vision to life.

When you go on an adventure, you can call on 1d4 helpers-a mix of cacklers (see chapter 6 for the stat block), stage hands, or extras-to help you complete it. Use the stat blocks of cultists and thugs from the Monster Manual for the stage hands and extras, respectively.

Your status also means that you can venture into the depths of Rix Maadi, the lair of Rakdos, to petition for a Rakdos charm (described in chapter 5). Rakdos can grant a charm with barely a thought, but your station in the guild doesn't guarantee safe passage to and from the demon's presence.

#### BLOOD WITCH (SPECIAL ROLE)

#### Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos, the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

The aggressive tormentors known as blood witches are the closest thing the Cult of Rakdos has to ranking officials. You can't personally mobilize large numbers of guild members, but individual performers, ogres, giants, and even demons are quick to obey your commands as long as they don't contradict the ethos of the guild or the will of Rakdos himself.

When you become a blood witch, you are assigned to torment a particular enemy of the guild. This enemy can be an individual, a family, an organization, or even an abstract concept. Examples of blood witches include the Judge of the Judges, who targets the Azorius guildmaster; the Tormentor of the Wojek, who confounds Boros military intelligence efforts; and the Disintegrator of Law and Order, who undermines all efforts to uphold law.

#### STAR PERFORMER

#### Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos

At last, you have the opportunity to display your genius to the masses. When you perform, you're the star of the show, the climax of a night of revelry. The rest of the guild regards you with admiration and more than a little envy, since crowds pack whatever venues you choose for your shows. Rakdos himself might even come to watch. You can count on the support of your ringmaster, and you can call on the aid of other performers in your troupe-just be careful not to turn your back on the ones who would kill in return for a moment in your spotlight.

You can bring 2d4 Rakdos performers and 1d4 Rakdos lampooners (see chapter 6 for these stat blocks) with you when you're going on stage or heading out to riot on the streets.

#### RINGMASTER

#### Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos

The show is yours to command. You determine what performers take center stage and when, and you design the exciting and bloody final act of the show-meaning that you decide who lives and who dies. You might adopt an ominous or overwrought title, such as Choreographer of Flame or the Dramaturge. A troupe of 3d10 + 20 Rakdos performers is at your service, and you can call on 2d4 blood witches to aid you with their magic (see chapter 6 for these stat blocks). You're probably also considered a significant public enemy by the Azorius, but they can't arrest you if they can't catch you.

#### ENEMIES AND ALLIES

A cult of demon worshipers doesn't make a lot of friends. Ideologically, the Rakdos have the most in

common with the Gruul and the Golgari; all three guilds have a desire to topple the structures of power in Ravnica. Of course, the guilds disagree about what (or who) should replace the existing structures.

Making the powerful look ridiculous lies at the heart of the Rakdos performance philosophy. The bulk of the guild's aggression is directed toward guilds that have power and abuse it or guilds that make blatant bids for power. That's particularly true when powerful guildsespecially the Azorius-try to use their power to suppress the Rakdos.

Making the ridiculous powerful is the flip side of the Rakdos philosophy. Usually, this means elevating the status of the Rakdos-and yourself-at the expense of others, but circumstances might lead you to cooperate with members of other guilds in pursuit of a common goal. For example, a power struggle in another guild can be an opportunity for you to install a sympathetic (or ineffectual) leader in that guild. Beyond that, other chaotic guilds have grudges against the law-enforcing guilds and would be happy to join your efforts to strike a blow against them.

#### THE RAKDOS VIEW ON OTHER GUILDS

The Cult of Rakdos serves a demon lord who is feared, if not respected, by most citizens of Ravnica. Its cultists express their zeal through riotous, bloody, and deadly performances and revels. To other guilds, they are a fearsome threat to the city. To the Rakdos, the other guilds invest too much effort in a vain search for meaning and might.

- Azorius. "Insufferable killjoys, and every artist's eternal enemy. Everyone thinks we are the guild of ultimate evil, but we're not the ones who want to monitor, legislate, and control your every move."
- Boros. "We love a parade, but their demonstrations always come across as stiff. They're the deserving straight man for our every punch line."
- Dimir. "They crave secrets, but there's nothing they can get by eavesdropping that we won't freely scream at the top of our lungs. They lurk in the shadows trying to look mysterious, practically inviting our mischief."
- Golgari. "We know they're tired of being the downtrodden, misunderstood misfits. If they're truly ready to anger the powers that be rather than lick boot soles, we invite them to run away and join our circus."
- Gruul. "Our well-meaning cousins in chaos! We want to take society down a peg, and they want to raze civilization to the dirt. That's practically common ground!"
- Izzet. "Every performance benefits from prop masters and pyrotechnicians. They can be useful backstage, but they lack the charisma for the spotlight."
- Orzhov. "The more the Orzhov try to coerce free people to act against their desires, the easier it is for Rakdos to gain recruits."
- Selesnya. "Such crowds! They would scarcely notice if they were missing a few by night's end. They'd make the perfect audience, if only they had a better appreciation for bleeding-edge art."
- Simic. "Imaginative creators who nevertheless fail to appreciate the meaning of their living creations-nor do they appreciate the tragic irony of not knowing how funny that is."

# SELESNYA CONCLAVE

SELESNYA TROOPS POURED INTO THE STREETS, emptying the nature temples, wildlife preserves, and other green spaces controlled by the conclave. The centaurs' hooves clattered on the cobblestones and the wolf-riders bounded over stone bridges. Human and elf infantry flooded through the arteries of the district, streaming past intersections and flowing around buildings. Griffons and their riders swooped down out of a blanket of low clouds, strafing past the spires. Emmara rode on the shoulder of a massive creature made of a snarl of marble, wood, and vines, her hand resting on its great head. Two more of the nature behemoths strode ahead of her, swinging their limbs in slow motion, indenting the streets with their footfalls as the other Selesnya troops ran between their legs. Below her, Captain Calomir led the Selesnya army. He rode his white war rhino, driving the Selesnya ranks forward, guiding them through the streets toward the Rakdos horde.

-Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

Like a thriving garden, carefully tended and abundantly fertile, the communities of the Selesnya Conclave are a harmonious union of nature and civilization. The members of the conclave dream of embracing all of Ravnica in their peaceful union. In the meantime, they are growing an army, preparing to resist the ambition and destructive impulses of the other guilds and fight to defend their way of life.

At the heart of the Selesnya faith and philosophy is the Worldsoul, called Mat'Selesnya, which its devotees believe to be a manifestation of nature itself. At the signing of the original Guildpact, Mat'Selesnya was embodied in an elemental form and acted as the guild's first guildmaster. The current guildmaster, Trostanithree dryads fused together with Mat'Selesnya into a single being-is said to embody the will of the Worldsoul in a similar way. The original mission of the conclave involved conservation and charity, but its focus has long been on expanding its community, in which all members are cared for and nature is preserved in harmony with civilization.

# INSIDE THE CONCLAVE

The Selesnya Conclave is organized into enclaves called vernadi, which are communes built around central trees. The vernadi are smaller versions of the guildhall, the great city-tree Vitu-Ghazi. A dryad, called a voda, is called forth from that central tree to be the leader of the community, connecting the vernadi and its devotees to the Worldsoul and uniting them with the will of the entire conclave.

A voda is accessible to all the guild members in her care. You have regular contact with your voda, who knows your name and has a good idea of your interests, goals, and strengths. And since your voda is mystically linked to the guildmaster, Trostani, through communion with the Worldsoul, it's safe to assume that Trostani knows who you are as well.

In addition to the voda, military and religious leaders in each vernadi regularly communicate with its members. Ordinary members of the conclave spend a few hours every day training with a military instructor and studying with a religious teacher.

#### GOALS OF THE SELESNYA

Despite the growing tensions that now grip the world. in the long view of the Selesnya Conclave, not much has changed. Ravnica is troubled, but Ravnica has always been troubled. The Living Guildpact is absent, but the Guildpact comes and goes. The Worldsoul has not changed, nor has the will of Mat'Selesnva: the conclave's main goal is to grow, as it has always been. Its strength lies in its numbers.

The conclave clings to the ideal of a peaceful collective in which individual desires are subordinate to the good of the whole group. The guild wants to see this beloved community grow, flourish, and thrive in peace. But as much as it values peace within the community, it displays incredible ferocity when that harmony is threatened.

Selesnya's vision is centered on the idea of harmony between civilization and nature. To advance the cause of civilized society, the conclave believes in the need for an ordered structure that orients the group toward

the pursuit of the common good. At the same time, the guild's connection with the natural world gives the conclave a fervent appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things. Selesnya doesn't tolerate selfishness or ambition, instead urging its members to put the needs of others ahead of their own desires and to use the power of nature-including nature's wrath-to drive away those whose selfishness threatens the coherence of the group.

The greatest danger that Selesnya faces lies in the ambitions of other guilds, which are flourishing in the absence of the Guildpact. Selesnya's way of curbing this grasping selfishness has always been to outnumber the other guilds. Its members aren't naive; they fully realize that the ambitions of other guilds will lead to violence. And they aim to be prepared for that violence when it erupts.

"For my seedlings to survive," Mat'Selesnya says, "we must grow an army capable of overwhelming such ambitions." Some of that army is literally grown, in the case of plant creatures and elementals. A great many members grow up in the guild from childhood and learn their martial skills at the guild's training grounds. And still more join the guild through recruitment-especially in these troubling times, when rumors of war and a sense of imminent doom make Selesnya's message of harmonious community sound ever more appealing.

# SELESNYA CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually good, often neutral

- Suggested Races: Human, centaur, elf (wood), halfelf. loxodon
- Suggested Classes: Bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, warlock

You might enjoy playing a Selesnya Conclave character if one or more of the following statements are true:

- · You like the idea of being part of a huge, peaceful community.
- · You like playing druids, rangers, or spiritual monks.
- · You believe in victory through respectful teamwork, overwhelming numbers, or both.
- · You want a spiritual connection to something bigger than just your character.

### JOINING THE SELESNYA CONCLAVE

New initiates come to the Selesnya Conclave as children, to be brought up by the guild's members, or as recruits drawn from the guildless or the membership of other guilds. Regardless of the path you took to get here, you start out in the role of initiate. As an initiate, you must subsume your desires to the needs of the guild while finding a way (under the guidance of your enclave's leader) to put your talents to use in service to Mat'Selesnya. This effort isn't so much a process of carrying out orders, but of gradually discerning the will of the Worldsoul and finding your place in it.

In your search for communion with the Worldsoul, you are part of a worldwide community, but you are also part of a smaller local community-an enclave called a vernadi, which is led by a dryad called a voda. Your role in the conclave is specifically oriented toward your ver-

nadi, at least at the start of your career. Your voda helps you in your process of discerning the will of Mat'Selesnya and your place in relation to it.

The Selesnya Conclave is both a community of worshipers and a militia, and thus its leadership includes both military and religious figures.

#### MILITARY ROLES

Selesnya looks from the outside like a peaceful community, but it is also an army. If you are a fighter, a ranger, or a paladin (usually having sworn the Oath of the Ancients), your place in the guild is a military one. Unlike in the Boros Legion, though, the conclave's military ranks aren't highly structured; each enclave has its own forces, with a single commander and one other layer of command (at most) above the troops. A variety of special military roles become available to you as you prove yourself useful to your vernadi and the conclave. You might aspire to be a votary standing watch over the temple gardens, a sagittar archer, a pegasus-riding equenaut, or a wolf-riding Ledev guardian.

#### RELIGIOUS ROLES

If you are a druid (perhaps of the Circle of the Land), a cleric (of the Life or the Nature Domain), a warlock with the Archfey (Mat'Selesnya) as a patron, or a devout monk (who might follow the Way of the Open Hand), you might be drawn to a role of religious leadership. These leaders mediate the relationship between the members

of the conclave and the voice of Mat'Selesnya. A number of special roles will be available to you as you establish your place. You might hope to carry the message of the conclave out into the world as an evangel, and great religious leaders are honored with the title of hierarch.

### BACKGROUND: SELESNYA INITIATE

You are a member of a blessed community, built on the ideals of harmony. Here, nature and civilization coexist peacefully, living and growing in accordance with the will of the Worldsoul, Mat'Selesnya. As a member of the Selesnya Conclave, you are surrounded by people and other creatures who share your worldview and your longing for deeper spiritual communion with the world. and you have a fervent desire to share the joy you have experienced with Ravnica. Along with the rest of the conclave, you are committed to resisting the ambitions of the other guilds-with military force if necessary.

- Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Persuasion
- Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument

Languages: Choose one of Elvish, Loxodon, or Sylvan Equipment: A Selesnya insignia, a healer's kit, robes, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins)

#### FEATURE: CONCLAVE'S SHELTER

As a member of the Selesnya Conclave, you can count on your guild mates to provide shelter and aid. You and your companions can find a place to hide or rest in any Selesnya enclave in the city, unless you have proven to be a danger to them. The members of the enclave will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives in this effort.

In addition, as a guild member you can receive free healing and care at a Selesnya enclave, though you must provide any material components needed for spells.

#### SELESNYA GUILD SPELLS

#### Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on the Selesnya Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

#### SELESNYA GUILD SPELLS

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| Cantrip | druidcraft, friends |
| 1st | aid, animal friendship, charm person |
| 2nd | animal messenger, calm emotions, |
|  | warding bond |
| 3rd | plant growth, speak with plants |
| 4th | aura of life, conjure minor elementals |
| 5th | awaken, commune with nature |

Members of the Selesnya Conclave refer to their magic as "doruvati," a Sylvan word meaning "gift." When you use these gifts of Mat'Selesnya, graceful. swirls of green and silver light dance in the air around you, and phantasmal green leaves might waft through

the air. A sensation of gentle warmth and the smell of spring flowers or autumn leaves might accompany your spells.

#### SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

Most members of the Selesnya Conclave are true believers-the tight-knit community allows little room for the cynical or disillusioned. They are spiritual, empathetic. and generally peaceful-unless roused to action. Their flaws and bonds alike grow naturally from their close ties to the community.

### How Do I FIT IN?

Although the guild teaches the importance of subjugating the individual will to the good of the conclave, it also celebrates the diversity of individuals, in the same sense that a field that produces different crops is healthier than one that yields a single crop. That principle applies to your skills as an adventurer. As long as your efforts are directed toward advancing the goals of the guild rather than your private agenda, you're allowed to put your talents to work in your unique way.

That said, you must never lose sight of the fact that you are part of a larger community. That includes the whole guild, of course, but your ties to community start with your vernadi (enclave) and its voda (dryad leader). The dryads want to know what you're doing and what

purpose it serves, and they act to curtail your actionsor even expel you from the guild-if they determine that you aren't serving Selesnya's best interests.

#### A SELESNYA PARTY

An adventuring party is a community in itself, a symbiotic group in which each individual contributes to the success of the whole. A fighter, a ranger, or a paladin provides a starting point of martial might. A druid or a cleric offers support and healing. A bard or a warlock gives additional spell support. A monk, a bard, or a ranger can add some measure of stealth and skill specialties. Such a group is well equipped to help Selesnya grow-and to smite the guild's enemies.

#### RANK AND RENOWN

The Selesnya Conclave doesn't classify its members in a rigid hierarchy, because doing that would encourage individuals to seek to rise above the rest of the community and put their desires above the good of the whole. Thus, aside from the leadership of Trostani over the whole guild, and each voda over her vernadi, the members of the conclave are distinguished mainly by the diverse roles they fill instead of by rank or status.

Indeed, many Selesnya initiates never leave that basic role. They have discerned their purpose, and it is to live a proper life in support of the conclave, without pursuing any kind of prestigious role. But if you achieve greater renown in the guild, a variety of special roles become available to you.

Regardless of renown and role, members of the conclave don't earn salaries. The guild cares for its own, however, and every member can live in a vernadi at the equivalent of a modest lifestyle.

#### EVANGEL (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave

Evangels extend their hands to potential converts and welcome new initiates into the life of the Selesnya Conclave. They include fervent preachers who speak the will of the Worldsoul in the promenades and marketplaces, humble missionaries who serve among the poor in the darkest districts of the city, and even centaur warriors who evangelize in Gruul territories where words of war speak louder than prayers of peace.

When you become an evangel, you gain one additional contact from a guild other than the Selesnya Conclave, which can be someone you have met in your adventures or chosen from the Non-Selesnya Contacts table earlier in this section. In your new role, you belong to a vernadi and can expect help and support from that community, but you spend your time away from it, operating with a great deal of independence. When you return to your vernadi, you teach and train new initiates.

#### VOTARY (SPECIAL ROLE)

#### Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave, proficiency with martial weapons

Votaries are soldiers who protect the vernadi gardens in the area immediately around its central tree. As a votary, you are usually assigned to guard duty, but your voda might also assign you to special missions that require strength of arms.

While you are in the garden you're sworn to protect, the plants obey your word, allowing you to transform the foliage into 1d6 awakened shrubs or 1 awakened tree (both described in the Monster Manual) for as long as a threat to the garden persists. These awakened plants won't leave the garden.

#### SAGITTAR (SPECIAL ROLE)

#### Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave, proficiency with the longbow

Sagittars are archers who defend key guild locations, including the guildhall at Vitu-Ghazi. Their range and accuracy are so great that a common saying has arisen among Ravnicans: "Sagittars aim their bows using maps." If a conclave mission would benefit from the support of disciplined archers. Trostani herself might call on sagittars to render aid.

As a sagittar, you never have to want for arrows; the guild provides arrows to you at no cost.

#### SELESNYA CHARM

#### Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave

You can request that the voda of your vernadi bestow a Selesnya charm (described in chapter 5) on you before you undertake any mission on the guild's behalf.

#### EQUENAUT (SPECIAL ROLE)

#### Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave, proficiency in Animal Handling

Equenauts are knights who ride pegasi and serve as warriors and scouts. In addition to surveilling enemy forces and terrain, they are also on the lookout for places where a new vernadi can take root. As an equenaut, you are sometimes called on to take part in military activity, but you are free to pursue your vision of how to serve Mat'Selesnya-from the back of your pegasus mount (see the stat block in the Monster Manual).

Your mount effectively belongs to you, entrusted to your care. If it comes to harm through your negligence or mistreatment, you might be punished-perhaps to the extent of losing your position as an equenaut.

#### HIERARCH (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave, Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

The ranks of the Selesnya clergy aren't hierarchical, yet you are honored with the title of hierarch. Hierarchs lead rites that invoke the blessing of Mat'Selesnya, bringing Selesnya's initiates into closer communion with the Worldsoul and with each other. They are assisted in these rites by less experienced clergy.

As a hierarch, you can call on the aid of 1d4 acolytes (see the stat block in the Monster Manual), even leading them on missions.

You have an important voice in decision-making for your vernadi, and you are expected to offer advice and opinions to your voda when requested.

Your position within the guild and your vernadi gives you access to superior food and lodging, the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

#### LEDEV GUARDIAN (SPECIAL ROLE)

Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave, 10th level or higher

The Ledev guardians are knights who were originally protectors of Ravnica's roadways but now serve the Selesnya as champions. Their ranks include a number of centaurs. The humanoids among them ride dire wolves, which they raise from pups to forge close bonds between rider and mount. If you have a dire wolf mount, it effectively belongs to you (see the Monster Manual for the stat block).

#### DIGNITARY (SPECIAL ROLE)

#### Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave

Chosen by Trostani herself, dignitaries act as emissaries in dealing with other guilds. As a dignitary, you must be available when Trostani has need of your service, but you have great latitude to pursue your vision of the guild's goals. You can call on 10d10 Selesnya initiates to support you in your missions for Trostani, and 8d10 initiates for a mission of your own devising. These initiates are acolytes, scouts (both described in the Monster Manual), or soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block).

Your position gives you access to the best food and lodging, the equivalent of a wealthy lifestyle.

#### ENEMIES AND ALLIES

The Selesnya philosophy is one that embraces all of Ravnica. Everyone is a potential ally, until the moment they demonstrate their hostility to the conclave or the will of the Worldsoul. The Selesnya have difficulty with the riotous Rakdos, the sinister Dimir, and the chaotic Izzet, but their focus on ordered community and verdant nature gives them some amount of common ground with every other guild.

Any guild can become an enemy of the conclave, though, if its guildmaster's ambitions-or rogue agents within the guild-upset the balance of power on Ravnica. From the other side, many other guilds see the Selesnya as a quiet threat and seek to diminish its strength before its numbers grow out of control, so as a member of the conclave you are duty-bound to oppose their operations of sabotage. The wanton plunder of Ravnica's natural resources can also provoke the Selesnya to take action.

When members of other guilds pursue noble aimspromoting peace, strengthening community, and opposing other guilds' efforts to expand-they act as allies of the conclave and thus your allies. Furthermore, they are potential recruits into the fold, since they have demonstrated their sympathy for Selesnya's goals and their value to the community.

#### THE SELESNYA VIEW ON OTHER GUILDS

In the Selesnya vision of a perfect Ravnica, the guilds would be abolished and all people would live in harmony with nature and each other. Until such a vision comes to pass, the conclave judges the other guilds against that standard of perfection.

- Azorius. "All their laws are meant to create a semblance of the unity that binds us already. If they would only be still and listen to the voice of Mat'Selesnya."
- Boros. "Sooner or later they will tire of their fighting, and when they do, the gentle embrace of the Selesnya will be waiting for them."
- Dimir. "Just as they hide from the light and cling to the shadows, they hide from life and cling to secrets. They see everything as a scheme, everyone a tool, instead of recognizing the power of unity and mutual growth."
- Golgari. "They wallow in filth and rot, too preoccupied with death to appreciate the bliss of life's connections."
- Gruul. "They are a desperate echo of what they should be, reaching blindly toward something greater. Such a waste. And a smelly, unreasonable, destructive one at that."
- Izzet. "The path to unity doesn't lie in the oppressive control of a massive ego like the dragon's. The Izzet can tinker and meddle all they like, but they are doomed to failure."
- Orzhov. "An endless stream of grasping hands, reaching for more and more, pursuing their individual ambitions at all costs-even from beyond the grave."
- Rakdos. "They laugh at tragedy and wallow in pain. Eventually, they will submit to Mat'Selesnya. Until then, they must be contained."

Simic. "They chart a twisted course of warping and mangling life and nature. Yes, we must grow and adapt, but nature will take its own time in completing that task."

# SIMIC COMBINE

THE SIMIC REPRESENTATIVE WAS A STERN-LOOKING mage whose parentage appeared to be partly human and partly aquatic, possibly merfolk; he rode astride a creature that seemed the offspring of a giant, blue-carapaced crab and an irate squid. The Simic squad was rounded out by a host of mages clad in scale armor, and improbable hybrid fusions of scaled, finned, and shelled creatures.

-Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The Secretist

The secrets of life are revealed in the laboratories of the Simic, and their research notes plumb and catalog nature's wonders. Their original mission was to oversee issues of public health, but the Simic came to believe that complete health-of individuals and of society as a whole-depends on the mutual adaptation of nature and civilization to one another. Thus, biological experimentation has always been among its primary concerns.

Historically, the guild's approach to its mission has been one of incremental progress toward a utopian ideal of thriving biology, and it remains more aloof from politics than other guilds. Its fundamental mission remains unchanged by the current political instability, and the isolation of its laboratories protects most Simic guild members from immediate harm.

Little is known about the combine's founder, except that this individual's first or family name was Simic.

# INSIDE THE COMBINE

Vast sinkholes called zonots are the primary geographic divisions among the Simic. Each zonot pierces layer upon layer of crumbled city as it descends deep below the surface and connects to ancient, long-forgotten ocean waters. A zonot is a distinct Simic habitat with its own culture and ecosystem, as well as a leader called a Speaker. The Speakers of all nine zonots form the

Speakers' Chamber, and they elect a Prime Speaker from among them to serve as the Simic guildmaster. Zegana, the current Prime Speaker, is the Speaker of Zonot One, which is located in a remote, sparsely inhabited part of Ravnica far from the political activity of the Tenth District.

The Simic guildhall, Zameck, is located in Zonot Seven within Precinct Five of Ravnica's Tenth District. A huge chamber just below the street serves as the gathering place for all the Speakers, as well as a location where non-Simic visitors can meet with the Prime Speaker or other combine emissaries.

#### GOALS OF THE SIMIC

Two philosophical principles, in tension with each other, combine to give the Simic Combine its unique approach to science and nature. In traditional Simic thought, these principles are called the Holdfast and the Upwelling.

The Holdfast principle, named for the biological mechanism that keeps kelp and sponges anchored to the sea floor, advises members of the Simic Combine never to stray so far from nature that they become "adrift." It espouses the idea that nature left undisturbed will evolve toward adaptive traits and increased strength. Nature will flourish and grow, and every creature will find its proper niche in the ecosystem where it can thrive.

The Upwelling principle, named for the phenomenon of nutrient-rich water rising to the ocean surface, advocates that the new and enlivened should replace the old and depleted in an unending cycle, bringing constant refreshment and renewal. This principle accounts for the combine's analytical bent and its emphasis on knowledge as a means of transformation. Learning the secrets of the universe lets you shape the world as you desire. The Upwelling encourages every creature to discover its full potential.

The Holdfast encourages the Simic to promote nature; the Upwelling urges them to perfect nature. The end result is the same: a hastened system of evolution that brings out the best in every creature's nature. But different factions within the Simic Combine interpret these principles in their own ways.

The leadership of the Simic Combine represents the traditional philosophy of the Utopians. Their vision is of an ideal world in which nature and civilization exist in balance, in which natural life adapts to life in the midst

# SIMIC CHARACTERS

Alignment: Usually neutral Suggested Races: Human, elf (high), Simic hybrid, vedalken

Suggested Classes: Druid, fighter, monk, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Simic Combine if one or more of the following statements are true:

- · You are drawn to the image of the mad scientist tinkering with the fundamental forces of life.
- · You like playing curious wizards, druids, or mutants.
- · Prying into secrets and mysteries inspires your curiosity.
- · You want to make the world a better place through research.

### JOINING THE SIMIC COMBINE

Many paths lead people to the Simic Combine, all of them guided by the notion that tomorrow can be made better than today. All of the guild's efforts strive to achieve a utopian future that they believe is within reach. When you join the Simic, choose one of the following roles for your character.

#### SCIENTIST

If you are a spellcaster such as a wizard or a druid, you can find a natural home among the Simic as a scientist, magically manipulating the forces of life and nature to shift the world toward the guild's utopian ideal. Most Simic wizards specialize in the School of Transmutation, using their magic to alter living creatures or alter the natural environment. Simic druids often choose the Circle of the Land, putting similar magic to the guild's service. Those who focus on manipulating

of modern civilization and the civilized world adapts to accommodate these creatures. Utopians generally interpret the Holdfast principle as being about staying rooted in nature, and the Upwelling as concerned with slow, predictable, cyclical improvement. So they remain hidden in their subaquatic laboratories, pursuing their research while isolated from the volatile interrelationships among the other guilds. Prime Speaker Zegana encourages that isolationist attitude.

At the same time, a growing faction within the Simic believes that an all-out war among the guilds is inevitable, given the growing unrest in the city. These members, the Adaptationists, believe that the guilds exist in a fragile ecosystem in which the slightest imbalance can have cascading effects. With an absent Living Guildpact failing to maintain the balance, only catastrophe can result. The Simic must change in order to survive, and slow, small steps in pursuit of an ideal vision aren't enough. The future of the guild is in imminent danger, and the Simic need to focus on survival. Adaptationists tend to interpret the Holdfast as being about defense and security, and the Upwelling as a call for sudden, disruptive growth.

As befits members of a guild of scientists, the Adaptationists' preparations for war include the creation of soldiers that are magically and biologically adapted. The Guardian Project has yielded hybrids that combine human, elf, or vedalken stock with the characteristics of crabs, fish, jellyfish, and a variety of other creatures to give them natural armor and weapons, gills, venomous stings, and other combat-focused adaptations.

life forms are known as biomancers, while those who focus on water, weather, and atmospheric conditions are called terraformers, but you can choose your own path of research.

#### GUARDIAN

If you are playing a Simic hybrid, you initially became involved in Simic research as a test subject in the Guardian Project. You volunteered to participate, but it's possible there was some pressure on you, or you viewed it as the only way to be accepted in the guild. Your biological modifications make you ideally suited to specific tasks, and you might come to operate as a spy, an infiltrator, or brute muscle. Good class options include fighter or rogue (of any archetype), or a monk of the Way of the Open Hand.

#### DEEPSAGE

You might instead choose an ascetic, contemplative life as a deepsage (perhaps as a wizard or monk). You would devote yourself to meditating on the philosophical principles of the Holdfast and the Upwelling, a pair of complementary ideas that describe the Simic approach to nature and the city. Deepsages inscribe short philosophical riddles, bordering on paradoxes, into shells, exoskeletons, and stones, and Simic guild members reflect on these sayings to advance their understanding of the combine's role in the world. Deepsage wizards typically specialize in the School of Conjuration, and deepsage monks follow the Way of the Four Elements (focusing on air and water over the other two elements).

#### BACKGROUND: SIMIC SCIENTIST

Imagine a perfect world: one in which nature and civilization exist in harmony, adapted to each other; one in which life is shaped to match its environment and the environment is shaped to match life. That's the world you have been trying to grow in the laboratories of the Simic Combine. Nature is all about adaptation, evolution, and balance-but for it to keep up with the pace of advancing civilization, nature needs some help from biomancers and terraformers. If, along the way, you happen to create super-soldiers and mutant monsters that can bolster the combine's defenses against the schemes and ambitions of the other guilds, so much the better.

#### Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Medicine Languages: Two of your choice

- Equipment: A Simic insignia, a set of commoner's clothes, a book of research notes, an ink pen, a bottle of squid ink, a flask of oil (made from blubber), a vial of acid (derived from digestive juices), a vial of fish scales, a vial of seaweed, a vial of jellyfish stingers, a glass bottle of unidentified slime, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins)
#### CLADES AND PROJECTS

As a Simic researcher, you are part of a clade-a diverse group of individuals combining disparate talents in pursuit of a common goal-or a researcher on a specialized, short-term project focused on addressing an immediate

need. You can roll a d6 or choose from the options in the Research Options table to determine your area of research.

#### RESEARCH OPTIONS

#### de Clade/Project

- l Hull Clade, focused on protection and durability
- 2 Fin Clade, focused on movement
- Gyre Clade, focused on cyclical patterns and 3 metamagic
- 4 Guardian Project, focused on creating guard monsters and super soldiers
- 5 Crypsis Project, focused on intelligence and counterintelligence
- 6 Independent research in a new area

#### FEATURE: RESEARCHER

When you attempt to learn or recall a magical or scientific fact, if you don't know that information, you know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a Simic laboratory, or sometimes from an Izzet facility, a library, a university, or an independent scholar or other learned person or creature. Knowing where the information can be found doesn't automatically enable you to learn it; you might need to offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people to reveal their secrets.

Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an inaccessible place, or that it simply can't be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

#### SIMIC GUILD SPELLS

#### Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on the Simic Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

#### SIMIC GUILD SPELLS

| Spell Level | Spells |
| --- | --- |
| Cantrip | acid splash, druidcraft |
| 1st | detect poison and disease, expeditious retreat, jump |
| 2nd | alter self, enhance ability, enlarge/reduce |
| 3rd | gaseous form, water breathing, wind wall |
| 4th | freedom of movement, polymorph |
| 5th | creation |

When your magic causes physical alterations in yourself or others, the result often displays the characteristics of fish, amphibians, or other water-dwelling creatures. Blue-green eddies of magical energy sometimes accompany your spellcasting, forming spirals that reflect the mathematical perfection of nature.

#### SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS

The bizarre science of the Simic Combine attracts a certain type of personality and encompasses a set of beliefs about the nature of life. Simic members' bonds and flaws derive from their scientific research-including their creation of new life forms, which they can become very attached to.

#### PERSONALITY TRAITS

#### 48 Personality Trait

- ] I can't wait to see what I become next!
- 2 I am convinced that everything inclines toward constant improvement.
- 3 I'm eager to explain every detail of my most intricate experiments and theories to anyone who shows the least bit of interest.
- 4 I assume that everyone needs even the most basic concepts explained to them.
- 5 I describe everything that happens as if it were going into my research notes (and it often is).
- 6 I am insatiably curious about the seemingly infinite forms and adaptations of life.
- 7 I can't resist prying into anything forbidden, since it must be terribly interesting.
- 8 I employ a highly technical vocabulary to avoid imprecision and ambiguity in my communication.

#### IDEALS

#### de Ideal

- Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 1
- 2 Change. All life is meant to progress toward perfection, and our work is to hurry it along-no matter what must be upended along the way. (Chaotic)
- 3 Knowledge. Understanding the world is more important than what you do with your knowledge. (Neutral)
- 4 Greater Good. I want to reshape the world into higher forms of life so that all can enjoy evolution. (Good)
- 5 Logic. It's foolish to let emotions and principles interfere with the conclusions of logic. (Lawful)
- 6 Superiority. My vast intellect and strength are directed toward increasing my sway over others. (Evil)

#### BONDS

#### de Bond

- l I helped create a krasis that I love like a pet and would carry with me everywhere ... except it's the size of a building, and it might eat me.
- 2 In my laboratory, I discovered something that I think could eliminate half the life on Ravnica.
- 3 The other researchers in my clade are my family-a big, eccentric family including members and parts of many species.
- 4 The laboratory where I did my research contains everything that is precious to me.

#### de Bond

- 5 I will get revenge on the shortsighted fool who killed my precious krasis creation.
- 6 Everything I do is an attempt to impress someone I love.

#### FLAWS

#### de Flaw

- F I have a rather embarrassing mutation that I do everything I can to keep hidden.
- 2 I'm more interested in taking notes on monstrous anatomy than in fighting monsters.
- 3 Every social situation I'm in seems to lead to my asking rude personal questions.
- 4 I'm supremely confident in my ability to adapt to any situation and handle any danger.
- 5 I'll take any risk to earn recognition for my scientific brilliance.
- 6 I have a tendency to take shortcuts in my research and any other tasks I have to complete.

#### CONTACTS

The fluid nature of clades, whose rosters span different laboratories and change as researchers discover new interests, creates abundant connections among the Simic. The guild members live in watery sinkholes called zonots, and their isolation shelters them from much contact with outsiders. Nonetheless, a fair number of Simic members are former members of other guilds.

Roll twice on the Simic Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Simic Contacts table.

#### SIMIC CONTACTS

#### d8 Contact

- My research builds on my parents' work and takes it 1 in interesting new directions.
- 2 If a serious problem confounds me, I can count on my mentor to provide clarity of thought.
- 3 A former laboratory colleague went on to work on the Guardian Project.
- 4 A former colleague has ventured into fields of research that are possibly immoral and almost certainly illegal.
- 5 A former lover is now the supervisor of a prominent clade.
- 6 My sibling has become an almost unrecognizable mutant.
- 7 An old friend has retreated into a secluded life as an ascetic deepsage, devoted to contemplating philosophical principles.
- 8 My former clade supervisor is now engaged in field research studying some of the largest beasts and monsters on Ravnica.

#### NON-SIMIC CONTACTS

#### d10 Contact

- My older sibling is upset that I didn't follow them into 1 the Azorius.
- 2 A Boros sergeant is always asking questions about my work, but I suspect they're genuinely curious.
- 3 A friend in my clade thinks I don't know they're a Dimir agent.
- 4 I helped a Golgari spore druid with the fertilization and growth of their fungus field.
- 5 I can't fathom what could have made my childhood friend run off and join the Gruul.
- 6 I love comparing notes with my friend in the Izzet, though our fields of research are very different.
- 7 I borrowed a lot of money from an Orzhov syndic to help finance my research.
- 8 A Rakdos ringmaster has taken an interest in my research which, come to think of it, might make a nice sideshow act.
- 9 I left the Selesnya-and a lover-behind when I joined the Simic.
- 10 Roll an additional Simic contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.

### How Do I FIT IN?

1221

As a Simic adventurer, your mission likely aligns with the Adaptationist philosophy; the disagreements and tensions among the guilds will soon erupt into open conflict, and your guild needs your help to ensure that the Simic survive. That help might come in the form of defending against Golgari incursions into Simic zonots or shielding Simic research from Azorius intrusion. It could also involve more subtle, diplomatic work to maintain balance among the guilds, or subterfuge aimed at undermining another guild's grab for power.

Self-improvement is also an important part of your mission. Anything you can do to make yourself more capable-whether learning a new spell or adopting a new hybridizing mutation-gives the Simic a stronger weapon in its arsenal. The combine must change to

survive, and that means individual members of the guild must grow and adapt as well.

#### A SIMIC PARTY

An adventuring party drawn from the ranks of the Simic is typically formed around the nucleus of one or two mages, perhaps a biomancer (wizard) or a terraformer (druid). They might be accompanied by a soldier (probably a Simic hybrid fighter) and a deepsage (monk).

#### RANK AND RENOWN

Tiers of responsibility and importance-functional ranks-create a hierarchy among the scientists of the Simic Combine. A scientist's course of advancement is the path of increasing responsibility within a clade or project. Guardians and deepsages have more limited opportunities for advancement, though they still gain the benefits of high renown scores.

#### RANK 1: TECHNICIAN

Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Simic Combine, Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

As a technician, you can begin performing experiments, following the instructions of a researcher as you operate instruments, care for experimental subjects, extract samples of bodily fluids, and run errands up and down the zonot and out into the city. Such errands can bring you into contact with members of other guilds and lead to adventures.

If you have any kind of pet, familiar, mount, or animal companion, you can add one random adaptation to it from the Minor Adaptations table (see the krasis section in chapter 6). Doing so requires 1d6 days of work (8 hours per day) for each creature, and the work must be done in a Simic facility.

#### RANK 2: RESEARCHER

Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Simic Combine

After doing your time as a technician, you are eligible to lead your own experiments. You must be associated with a clade or a project, and must work on experiments related to its primary focus under the general guidance of the clade or project leader. Project leaders are more hands-on, ensuring that your research contributes to reaching the immediate objective. Clade leaders check in from time to time, but they give you wide latitude to pursue your own experiments under the general aegis of the clade's interests.

If your research requires it, your project leader or clade leader can equip you with a Simic charm (described in chapter 5) before you undertake a mission or an experiment. In addition, you can call on a category 1 krasis (see chapter 6 for the stat block) to assist you on any mission authorized by the guild. You choose the krasis's two adaptations.

#### LUMINARY (SPECIAL ROLE)

#### Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Simic Combine

As a guardian, deepsage, or other non-scientist within the Simic, you don't progress through ranks, but as a luminary vou might be entrusted with the leadership of guerrilla or espionage missions, with other Simic hybrid agents under your command. Or you might be respected as a wise and enlightened teacher.

If your work for the guild requires it, a project leader, clade leader, or other superior can equip you with a Simic charm (described in chapter 5) before you undertake a mission or an experiment on the guild's behalf.

In addition, when you're on guild business, you can call on the following Simic hybrid agents to assist you: one hybrid brute or hybrid flier, up to two hybrid poisoners or hybrid shockers, or 1d4 hybrid spies (see chapter 6 for these stat blocks).

#### RANK 3: PROJECT LEADER

#### Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the Simic Combine

A proven researcher, you are eligible to oversee your own project, directing the efforts of other researchers toward the solution of some problem facing the guild. The Speaker of your zonot gives you laboratory space, and you have a staff of 3d12 researchers (which use the stat blocks of commoners or merfolk from the Monster Manual). You can have this staff work on projects for you, which can include the creation of a category 2 krasis (see chapter 6 for the stat block) with adaptations of your choosing, which you can then bring outside the laboratory on important business, ideally under carefully controlled conditions.

Hosting the work of a successful and important project reflects well on the Speaker of a zonot, so your Speaker keeps a close eye on your work. On the positive side, you can count on access to the considerable resources of the zonot as long as your research is going well. On the other hand, you can expect your Speaker to try to meddle in your work to ensure that your efforts remain relevant to the overall goals of the Simic Combine.

#### RANK 4: CLADE LEADER

#### Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 50 or higher in the Simic Combine

As a famous researcher or a successful project leader, you stand ready to take on a supervisory role for an entire clade. New clades rarely form, so you must wait for your clade leader to retire (one way or another) before a position exists for you to fill, except in truly exceptional circumstances. Similar to a project leader, you are responsible for directing the efforts of researchers exploring a wide variety of projects related to the focus of your clade. Unless an experiment turns out to be especially interesting, these efforts can carry on without your supervision. If you need to, you can enlist the aid of 5d12 researchers (which use the stat blocks of commoners or merfolk from the Monster Manual), and you can also request the support of hybrids, krasis, or any other creature associated with the Simic Combine (see the list in chapter 6) from the Speaker of any zonot where the members of your clade live and work.

Because most clades span multiple zonots, you have status equal to the Speakers of the zonots. You have no voice on the Speakers' Chamber, unless you can persuade one or more of its members to speak on your behalf.

#### SPEAKER (SPECIAL ROLE)

#### Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Simic Combine

You are eligible to become the Speaker of a zonot. The selection of a new Speaker (in the event of an existing Speaker's retiring, dying, or otherwise leaving the position) takes place through a combination of popular election and the input of the other eight Speakers, with the current Prime Speaker having the final word. If you emerge as the victor after this rigorous process, you assume the leadership of your zonot and are empowered to bring its concerns before the Speakers' Chamber.

You are a political leader rather than a scientific one, so you have authority over other members of the combine only if they live and work in your zonot. If a clade has a laboratory in your zonot, you have the right (and responsibility) to supervise its activities to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, but not to interfere in its research beyond that point. And if the clade leader lives in a different zonot, you have no authority whatsoever over that person.

#### ENEMIES AND ALLIES

The Simic Combine has an affinity for guilds that care for the forces of nature, and as such it has worked alongside the Selesnya, Gruul, and Golgari in the past. To a lesser extent, the combine also has a rapport with the other scientific guild, the Izzet. But overall, the Simic attitude toward other guilds is one of healthy caution bolstered by a general tendency toward isolation.

Any guild could break the peace and send the entire world spiraling into war, so all the guilds are potential enemies-particularly if they direct their aggression at the Simic Combine. The Golgari Swarm has launched a direct attack against Zonot Four (located in the Sixth District), and they could expand that attack to other zonots at any time. Azorius arresters are prying into all the zonots, looking for evidence of wrongdoing. Thus, the Simic efforts at preparing for war are in danger, and the need for those efforts to be brought to fruition could arise at any time.

Your most obvious allies are those who seek to restrain the ambition of other guilds and maintain the balance of power. At various times, that category could include members of any other guild, particularly the Selesnya Conclave. Everyone (with the possible exception of the chaotic Rakdos and Gruul) has an occasional interest in maintaining the status quo, no matter how revolutionary that notion might seem at other times.

#### THE SIMIC VIEW ON OTHER GUILDS

The most insular members of the Simic Combine avoid interacting with other guilds entirely. No one but another Simic scientist could ever fully grasp or appreciate the work of the guild, and too many of the other guilds react with fear to what they don't understand.

- Azorius. "An absurd and inelegant construct, forever trapped in a maze of their own making. They would outlaw evolution if they could. And if any of them truly seek utopia, the rest are far too busy shuffling papers to notice. Avoid their attention at all costs."
- Boros. "They style themselves the agents of 'justice.' But the law is no better excuse for aggression than any other."
- Dimir. "We need not compete. Let them be, and they will let us be-but observe them closely."
- Golgari. "Less an organization than an infestation. They are nearly as adaptable as we are, and they seem intent on competition. More than any other guild, they pressure us to improve."
- Gruul. "The Gruul conceive of nature only in terms of savagery and privation. But their ways are no less a response to civilization than our own. They will survive, barely, and perhaps one day they will understand."
- Izzet. "The Izzet have spent ten thousand years mimicking the appearance of research, producing more pyrotechnics than progress. Surely that is a performance to rival the Rakdos."
- Orzhov. "They hoard their treasure throughout their pointless lives and lengthy afterlives. With such riches, we could swiftly bring about a future in which gold is as irrelevant as death."
- Rakdos. "Camouflage, mimicry, resilience, and versatility. If the guilds were species, we would count the Rakdos among the most impressive. But they aren't, and that makes the Rakdos far more erratic-and dangerous."
- Selesnya. "Like us, they seek a synthesis between 'natural' and 'artificial' systems. Unlike us, they wish to achieve it by unconditional surrender. They are adequate partners in stable times, but in the present climate they have little to offer."

# CHAPTER 3: THE TENTH DISTRICT

HE TENTH DISTRICT IS A SPRAWLING PLACE. To be governed effectively, it is broken into six precincts, each the size of a small city. This chapter describes the various features you can find in those wondrous places.

# THE SIX PRECINCTS

Each precinct, as well as its distinct personality, is explored in its own section later in this chapter. Here are brief descriptions of each of them to help orient you before your tour:

- Precinct One. This is the hub of the wealthy and powerful, where courtly games and espionage play out among visitors gawking at the impressive architecture. The precinct is also known as the Guildpact Precinct.
- Precinct Two. Many professionals live here in clean and orderly neighborhoods, in the shadow of New Prahv, while mob bosses coerce residents in order to enrich themselves and influence local politics.
- Precinct Three. In the Greenbelt, nature has encroached into the urban environment to varying degrees, and folk here provide bountiful sustenance and domesticated beasts for most of the district.
- Precinct Four. Constantly in a state of turmoil, the scarred streets of Precinct Four are a proving ground for soldiers and marauders alike. Visitors here had best be spoiling for a fight.
- Precinct Five. Precinct Five is where the learned folk of the Tenth District gather to discuss theory or to put their knowledge to practical use in the precinct's many schools, libraries, and laboratories.
- Precinct Six. In the hardscrabble neighborhoods of Precinct Six, the working folk eke out a living by toiling at warehouses, docks, and factories controlled by callous employers. When night comes, the residents hide indoors to avoid becoming prey to creatures that stalk the darkness.

### PEOPLE AND RUMORS

Each precinct's section includes two tables that can help you, as DM, improvise as characters explore that part of the city.

When a character wants to talk to a person on the street, you can roll on the People on the Street table for the precinct. Unless otherwise noted, these NPCs can be of any race. They might use the Monster Manual stat blocks for commoners, guards, or other creatures, at your discretion.

Whenever characters are gathering information or talking with contacts in a precinct, you can use the Rumors table for the precinct to add some flavor to their interactions or to generate adventure hooks.

# MAJOR TRADE WAYS

Two major avenues run across the whole Tenth District, crossing precinct lines.

Tin Street is the longest thoroughfare in the city, a vital center of trade, and a hub of activity day and night. In addition to its shopping attractions, Tin Street is also a popular spot for nightlife, with its many restaurants and theaters. Much of the street runs through the western part of Precinct Four, and other parts are claimed by goblin gangs. The prominent presence of Boros soldiers along the length of Tin Street helps the populace feel safer, but the threat of rubblebelt raiders and goblin thieves remains.

The Transguild Promenade makes its way across the district from the edge of the rubblebelt in Precinct Four to the southern gates of Precinct One. The Promenade's northern reach is heavily patrolled by Boros soldiers, and caravans coming from the north employ heavily armed escorts to ensure their safe passage through the ruined areas. Markets and parks line the avenue as it winds through Precinct One, and parades clog the street on festive holidays.

# BENEATH THE STREETS

Even though most Ravnicans think the city begins at ground level and stretches upward, the part of the city that lies beneath the streets impacts the lives of everyone. Immediately underground are the city works, such as the sewers and the transit system. Below the complex network of tunnels and passages that make up the city works lies the undercity-a realm populated by creatures that shun the surface world.

### CITY WORKS

The Izzet League is responsible for constructing and maintaining public works, including sewers and other pipe systems. Many members of the Golgari Swarm live or work here, farming fungus and scavenging for valuable trinkets in the muck. Orzhov crypts and vaults, Dimir hideouts, and Simic laboratories can also be found in the city works.

#### MILLENNIAL PLATFORM

Anchored by enormous chains at the juncture of Precincts One. Three, and Four, the Millennial Platform is a floating observation deck that affords the best overhead view of the Tenth District. The most exclusive restaurant in the district is located here. Every citizen is given a token that can be redeemed for one airship ride to the platform anytime during the coming year, but those who want to dine at the Millennial Restaurant might have to make a reservation months in advance.

PRECINCT FOUR

#### SEWERS

A vast, winding sewer network runs under the Tenth District, lit by continual flame spells. Some of the tunnels are simply storm sewers, meant to carry rainwater (and the debris it washes from the streets) into great cisterns, where it is purified and sent into the pipes in the plumbing system that serves Ravnica's nicer neighborhoods. Others carry waste and refuse out of those neighborhoods, depositing it in different cisterns or dumping it into the subterranean oceans of the undercity.

#### PIPE TUNNELS

Around the sewer system, smaller tunnel networks carry steam, distilled magical energy, and water to various places throughout the city. These passages are large enough for a humanoid to walk through but are often quite uncomfortable, filled with impure air and stifling heat.

#### TRANSIT TUNNELS

Magically charged tracks line the floors of tube-like tunnels that send vehicular constructs to major locations in the Tenth District and beyond. The tunnels open into small stations that have staircases leading up to the surface.

#### CRYPTS

Ancient resting places lie in secret chambers below the surface of Ravnica. Many of them have been magically warded to prevent unauthorized entry. Some of these sites are homes for restless undead or gathering places for thieves, smugglers, and other criminals.

#### UNDERCITY

Deep below the Tenth District lies a vast, thriving community of folk who have no desire or choice to live under the sky. Here, the Dimir, Golgari, Rakdos, and Simic hold sway in the caverns, causeways, and bodies of water that grace the darkest depths.

#### NIGHTVEIL

The sprawling residence of many of the House Dimir elite, parts of Nightveil overlap the Tenth District in the undercity. An extensive system of natural caverns houses high-walled mansions and sunken crypts that have a grand, sinister motif. Patrolling specters and other incorporeal undead make it difficult for the unwelcome to enter.

#### DUSKMANTLE

The Dimir guildhall is protected by memory wards (glyphs of warding that store modify memory spells) to ensure that few know of its existence. Those who are called there never remember

what transpired, beyond what is necessary. Most assume that the place lies somewhere within Nightveil, but it could lie anywhere in the undercity.

#### KOROZDA

Also called the Maze of Decay, Korozda is an arched subterranean cathedral surrounded by fungal hedgerows and moss-encrusted ruins. In its center is a great amphitheater where the most important issues are brought to the Golgari's attention. Penvar, the Hanging Keep, is a castle fixed upside down on the ceiling above the entrance to Korozda. Its soldiers, predominantly the insectoid kraul, prevent any unauthorized visitors to the Golgari stronghold.

#### RIX MAADI

Known as the Dungeon Palace, this is the guildhall of the Cult of Rakdos, and the lava-filled lair of the demon himself. An immense, crumbling, red stone staircase called the Demon's Vestibule begins the journey from the Smelting District down into the depths, treating travelers to terrifying images depicted on banners as they descend. Farther down, the temperature rises and the passage eventually opens up into the Festival Grounds, where the bloodiest performances of the Rakdos and their torturous equipment are on display.

#### THE UNDERSEA

Rivers, lakes, and oceans run deep below the surface of Ravnica. Several of them connect to the Simic habitats known as zonots. They are also used as thoroughfares by aquatic races and monsters.

# PRECINCT ONE

The grandeur of Precinct One is the heart of Ravnica's civilization, and visitors gawk at the impressive architecture and rub shoulders with the rich and powerful. Immaculately maintained avenues and manicured gardens create an impression of order, civility, and high culture. During the day, the streets are filled with tourists, government officials, diplomats, and wealthy merchants and financiers. At night, most of Precinct One is quiet, with a few lit carriages drawn by constructs and well-groomed beasts making their way to exclusive nightclubs and restaurants.

The people who live in this precinct are accustomed to having high-quality goods and spending a lot of leisure time in social engagements. Neighbors are polite and affable toward others of their station, but gossip is quite common and accepted.

#### AFFILIATED GUILDS

All the guilds have interests here. Lawyers, bureaucrats, and soldiers of the Azorius Senate are found throughout the precinct. The Orzhov Syndicate runs many of the clubs and restaurants here, and this is the location of both its guildhall, Orzhova, and its monumental Vizkopa Bank. The Selesnya Conclave helps to maintain the grounds around the plaza and is often involved as diplomatic envoys for meetings and negotiations that take place here.

#### NEIGHBORHOODS AND LANDMARKS

Precinct One has few permanent residents, except for the very wealthy and some government officials who live in well-appointed apartments. Buildings here are of modern construction and well maintained.

#### TENTH DISTRICT PLAZA

A popular place for meetings, recreation, shopping, and simply being seen, Tenth District Plaza is a beautiful oasis of calm and cleanliness. Kept perpetually clean through magic and constantly patrolled by Azorius arresters, the plaza is considered neutral ground for every guild, gang, and faction in the city. Drawing a weapon within the confines of the plaza is met with a swift response from the arresters and marks the offender as a person who can't be trusted.

#### CHAMBER OF THE GUILDPACT

The long promenade of Plaza Avenue connects the south end of Tenth District Plaza to the great meeting hall of the guilds. The Chamber of the Guildpact is accessible by a grand staircase leading up into a cavernous hall where visitors and dignitaries from all over Ravnica meet. The Living Guildpact has an office here, but he is seldom present. In his absence, various functionaries who occupy the upper levels of the chamber try to carry out his work of adjudicating disputes between guilds and maintaining a semblance of peace.

#### PLAZA EAST

This neighborhood is home to many government officials, and it offers temporary housing for diplomats. Stately homes intermingle with more modest apartments. Transportation by carriage between Plaza East and Tenth District Plaza is readily available, especially in the morning and evening.

#### PLAZA WEST

The best nightclubs and restaurants, most of which are run by the Orzhov, are in this neighborhood. There are few permanent residents in Plaza West, aside from the very rich who reside in spacious, luxurious, multilevel homes.

#### PLAZA SOUTH

Derogatorily known as Downside by the nobles and elite, this neighborhood is the hub of commerce in Precinct One and has more permanent residents than the other neighborhoods. Specialty shops catering to tourists and the wealthy line the route of the Transguild Promenade as it runs through the area. The residents here tend to be well-to-do merchants and crafters, making their living off visitors and a few rich clients.

#### ORZHOVA

The Orzhov Syndicate's lavish guildhall, also known as the Church of Deals, is on the western edge of Tenth District Plaza. The towering spires and stained glass windows house the grand gatherings of the guild and also serve as the quarters for its most elite members. including the ghosts of the Obzedat. Below the cathedral lies the mausoleum, glittering with opulence and serving as a resting place and a gathering point for secret meetings far from prying eyes and the Guildpact.

#### VIZKOPA BANK

The Orzhov-controlled main bank of Ravnica, and also the place where the Orzhov mint their coins, Vizkopa Bank is a giant, opulent structure guarded by gargoyles. Spirits in debt to the Orzhov float within its halls and around the outside of the building.

#### GOODS AND SERVICES

There are few general shops in Precinct One, but luxury items, grooming supplies, and fine clothing are available in boutiques in the area. Even practical items, such as backpacks and lanterns, are expensive and of the highest quality, bearing artisan's flourishes. Standard adventuring gear, including weapons and armor, is difficult to procure.

Meals and lodging suitable for a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle are readily available in Plaza West, and comfortable accommodations are the norm for the officials in Plaza East and the merchants in Plaza South. Poorer people, including anyone who maintains a lifestyle as expensive as modest, might be seen as uncouth or undesirable.

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who don't maintain a comfortable or more expensive lifestyle might have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct One.

ONG-HAO HAN

### LAW AND CRIME

The privileged and wealthy people who live in Precinct One believe that the purpose of law enforcement is to serve them and keep them protected from the more unsavory elements of the city. Government officials here are more practical in their view of the law, recognizing that Precinct One is the entry point into the Tenth for many visitors and thus it must keep up the best of appearances. Azorius law enforcement officers are ever-present here, with at least one arrester assigned to patrol each street in Precinct One. It is illegal to brandish a weapon here, and people who walk around with unconcealed weapons (even sheathed ones) draw attention. Minor crimes are reported as soon as they are witnessed or discovered. Due to enhanced monitoring by precognitive mages, the typical response time to any crime is 1d6 minutes, and the squad consists of an Azorius lawmage and three soldiers (see chapter 6 for these stat blocks).

Very little street-level illicit activity takes place within Precinct One due to Azorius's constant surveillance. Private rooms in exclusive establishments are, however, sometimes used by the Orzhov and other wealthy criminals to conduct high-end black market transactions away from the eyes of law enforcement.

# PRECINCT TWO

Small houses, modest apartments, and commercial shops are sprinkled throughout Precinct Two, a place that law enforcement officers, lawyers, retired soldiers, and well-off working families call home. Corner shops cater to everyday needs, and many establishments are run by ex-soldiers. Streets are kept tidy, and buildings are maintained to be serviceable. Under the precinct's urbane veneer, tension simmers between law officers and the opportunistic crime families who call this precinct home.

The folk who live in this precinct believe in performing civic duties, conforming to your role, and maintaining strong friendships and family ties. Good neighbors show respect to one another and enjoy competing among themselves to achieve greater successes.

### AFFILIATED GUILDS

New Prahv, the Azorius Senate guildhall, is located at the eastern end of the precinct, and many residents work there. Some active officers and retired soldiers from the Boros Legion make their homes in this precinct. The Orzhov Syndicate has a presence here through its connections to many of the small businesses.

#### NEIGHBORHOODS AND LANDMARKS

Most of Precinct Two is occupied by small commercial centers and rows of simple houses. It is populous but not stiflingly so.

#### NEW PRAHV

106

The tallest structure in the Tenth District, the austere New Prahv consists of three towering columns, reminding everyone of the omnipresence of the Azorius Senate. Each column serves as the headquarters for one of the three branches of the senate. Inside, spacious chambers on the lower floors give way to a host of offices upstairs where day-to-day assignments are issued and the strategy of maintaining law is continually honed.

#### WHITESTONE

Whitestone is an orderly neighborhood on the northern side of the precinct, named for its rows of alabaster stone houses. It was built up by the Azorius to serve as a housing zone for many who work in New Prahv. To meet the demands of construction, many residents of this section of the city had to be relocated to the much more densely populated Griffin Heights.

#### GRIFFIN HEIGHTS

Two-story houses are nestled in the rolling hills of this neighborhood in the southern section of the precinct. Griffin Heights is rife with corruption, and less scrupulous government officials exchange information and money with the Orzhov in business establishments here. The locals are fiercely loyal to the Orzhov knights who watch over them, dutifully paying their protection fees.

#### AUGUSTIN STATION

The main airship station for the Tenth District, Augustin Station is located at the western end of Griffin Heights. Travelers from all over Ravnica are carried in various forms of air travel: from gondolas hung from giant balloons to compartments strapped to the backs of enormous floating beasts bred by the Simic Combine. Augustin Station has twenty platforms, with flights arriving and leaving at all hours. The most popular flight is to the Millennial Platform, a journey that costs 5 sp per passenger. Other flights carry passengers to smaller

stations in each precinct of the Tenth District (1 gp), to large stations in each other district (10 gp), and to various other stations around the world (1 gp per mile).

#### STATUE OF AGRUS KOS

A ten-foot-tall granite statue of a Boros Legion soldier stands in a small park in Whitestone, surrounded by weatherworn tables. During the Decamillennial Celebration seventy-six years ago, Agrus Kos became a hero by foiling various schemes to undermine the Guildpact. His statue has become a social gathering point for war veterans, mob contacts, and spies who talk as they play various strategy games.

### GOODS AND SERVICES

Most any sort of merchandise can be acquired from some shop in Precinct Two. Former soldiers and ex-adventurers run many of the businesses here, and weapons and armor are commonly available in Griffin Heights. Meals and lodging are often of modest or comfortable quality in this precinct, which has lots of boarding houses instead of inns. Corner taverns are frequent and serve as the centers of neighborhood society.

The people who live in Precinct Two aren't fond of people who don't fit in with them, and that includes those of both higher and lower means. People who don't maintain at least a modest lifestyle are viewed as lazy and undesirable, and those who aspire to a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle are seen as arrogant snobs. At the DM's discretion, adventurers in either category could have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct Two.

#### LAW AND CRIME

Many citizens in Precinct Two work for the Azorius, but others feel stifled by the guild's intrusive presence under the shadow of New Prahv. Most residents respect order, but some rely more on Orzhov protection than on Azorius law. Almost everyone here knows someone who is trained in the use of weapons. The typical response to a reported crime is about 2d6 minutes, and the squad consists of two Azorius soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block) or 1d6 Orzhov thugs (from the Monster Manual).

The organized crime elements of the neighborhoods are locked in a power struggle against law enforcement officials. This conflict rarely manifests in open violence, but often antagonists "disappear" or "have an accident." Overt violent crimes sometimes involve ex-soldiers who have been psychologically scarred by past battles.

Ample parks, busy stables, and large gardens combine to create a vibrant environment in Precinct Three. Natural and urban life intermingle throughout the precinct, and the people who reside here view it as a respite from most other places in the Tenth District. Folk here tend to live simply, and generations of families have dwelt in the same structures for hundreds of years. During the day, the gardens, small pastures, and stables are tended by young and old. Evenings are given over to communal gatherings, sometimes featuring performances by trained beasts or storytelling.

The people of Precinct Three are comfortable with living around nature. They have no problems with pets or beastly companions sharing their space as well as residing in multifamily structures. Good neighbors help tend to plants, animals, and children whenever necessary.

#### AFFILIATED GUILDS

The Selesnya Conclave's influence on this area is strong, and its guildhall, the towering tree of Vitu-Ghazi, stands at the northern edge of the precinct. Members of the Gruul Clans sometimes venture into the northern part of the precinct, rarely with peaceful intentions.

#### NEIGHBORHOODS AND LANDMARKS

Precinct Three is made up of old stone structures partially reclaimed by nature, standing alongside well-preserved wooden buildings that have been enhanced by Selesnya magic.

#### VITU-GHAZI

The Selesnya guildhall, a towering tree that also serves as a cathedral to Mat'Selesnya, is the epicenter of Selesnya culture and law. Members of the conclave from across Ravnica make pilgrimages to Vitu-Ghazi in hopes of finding a spiritual connection with the heart of the guild. All who come without ill intent in their heart are welcome to visit the public areas of the tree.

#### THE CANOPY

The northern neighborhood of the precinct is covered in tall trees, all of which are overshadowed by Vitu-Ghazi. To accommodate a growing population, buildings are situated around the trees and on the larger branches, making use of a network of ladders and rope walkways.

#### THE GREAT CONCOURSE

A network of elevated roadways links many of the most important Selesnya communities near Vitu-Ghazi. The polished white stone of the roadways gleams in the sun, and the pathways are topped with lush trees, grasses, and flowers. On high holy days, its central hub, called the Great Concourse, serves as a gathering place for throngs of Selesnya devotees. On most other days, the Concourse is a teeming marketplace where goods transported across the city on the great roadways are bought and sold.

#### CONCORDANCE

Once known as the Old City, the eastern neighborhood of Concordance is the oldest section of the precinct.

Many buildings in this area were once Orzhov structures. but they have been reclaimed by moss, shrubs, and other growth that make them blend in with the homes, parks, and the Selesnya vernadi that fill the rest of the neighborhood. The Great Concourse runs overhead through most of the neighborhood.

#### BEAST HAVEN

The western neighborhood has many small pastures and stables, some of which are on open, multilevel structures. The area is filled with the sights, sounds, and smells of beasts of many sorts. Here, beasts are trained for labor and sold to customers from across the city. Every so often, a beast escapes captivity and rampages through the neighborhood, but the tough residents are usually able to bring any disruption under control quickly.

### GOODS AND SERVICES

The bounty of nature is plentiful in Precinct Three, which serves as the main source of food for the Tenth District. The finest steeds and livestock are raised here, as well as many war beasts (although they're often trained in Precinct Four). Unlike in most other precincts, barter is an acceptable form of transaction here, and some vendors outright reject payment in coin of any kind. Manufactured goods are relatively hard to find, except in large markets such as the Great Concourse.

Meals and lodging are widely varied, from squalid to comfortable, depending on the neighborhood. In general. the neighborhoods in Concordance tend toward the more expensive end of that scale, and those in Beast Haven more toward the other end. The residents of Precinct Three don't put much stock in personal appearance, and they're slow to pass judgment on anyone based on visible standards of wealth. The truly wretched sometimes evoke pity and sometimes scorn, and the very wealthy are generally disliked.

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle could have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct Three.

### LAW AND CRIME

Most of Precinct Three is policed by its residents, occasionally supplemented by Boros troops when a serious threat rears its head. Each block elects a watch captain, who receives weapon training from Selesnya soldiers. The captain can call on additional citizens for support in case of a crisis. The typical response to a reported crime takes about 1d8 minutes, and the squad consists of a watch captain (a scout) with two guards or two wolves. In Concordance, it's either a knight or a Selesnya druid with a topiary guardian (awakened tree). See the Monster Manual for these creatures' stat blocks.

Crime usually takes one of two forms in Precinct Three. Some residents engage in outright banditry, but they typically target visitors or go outside the precinct to do their dirty work. More common are incidents of livestock theft, which sometimes lead to outbreaks of violence between neighbors, particularly in Beast Haven.

# PRECINCT FOUR

Few days or nights pass quietly in Precinct Four. The frequent din of battle as Boros soldiers guard against Gruul marauders, the strange sounds of volatile magic emanating from Izzet experiments, and the occasional explosive flare-ups of goblin gang wars keep the precinct a dynamic and dangerous place. Its buildings include ramshackle tenements damaged by conflict, impregnable fortresses and laboratories, and bustling markets filled with merchants ready to defend themselves and their wares.

The people of Precinct Four are always ready for a fight. Being able to defend oneself and adapting to change are the most important qualities in this precinct. Good neighbors are your battle mates when you're fighting for your home or your life.

### AFFILIATED GUILDS

The Boros Legion's guildhall fortress, Sunhome, is located here, and that guild is the heart of the precinct's defense against the savage forces that come from the northern rubblebelt. The Izzet League often likes to test its latest experiments in this precinct. Its guildhall, Nivix, towers over the south end. The Gruul Clans frequently raid into the rest of the precinct from the rubblebelt in the north. The Cult of Rakdos delights in sowing mayhem here, stoking the fires of conflict and gathering inspiration for future performances.

### NEIGHBORHOODS AND LANDMARKS

Precinct Four is home to a wide range of folk, most of whom are used to fighting for a living. Transients, soldiers, goblin gang members, and hardy merchants call this precinct home.

#### SUNHOME

The seat of the Boros Legion's power, the guildhall known as Sunhome is an imposing structure that serves as a fortress, barracks, and spiritual center. It is widely believed to be impregnable and serves as a reminder to attackers from the north of the strength of Boros resolve.

#### NIVIX

One of the tallest towers in Ravnica, this impressive structure crackles with the wild power of the Izzet and serves as their guildhall. Filled with laboratories, testing facilities, and housing for their inventors. Nivix is the center of Izzet innovation.

#### RED WASTES

The rubblebelt to the north is a wasteland filled with ruins, gutted buildings, and debris-ridden streets. Aside from the Gruul Clans, the only citizens who live in the neighborhood are the ones too stubborn to move away. The Gruul share the space with ferocious beasts, elementals, and other monsters.

#### THE BULWARK

The neighborhood between Sunhome and Nivix is filled with reinforced structures that serve as low-rent apartments and shops. Those who live in the Bulwark are mainly workers or professionals who see opportunity in supporting the Boros garrison.

#### SKARRG

The Gruul Clans periodically converge on the gutted. cratered remains of a huge palace in the Red Wastes where a great bonfire perpetually burns. Skarrg is the closest thing the Gruul have to a guildhall-a place where their clans can come together, roast giant boars, boast of their exploits, and form something akin to camaraderie before they go their separate, violent ways. It's not neutral ground, though-old grudges frequently boil over into combat. Outsiders are never welcome.

#### GOODS AND SERVICES

Precinct Four has a wide variation in available goods. depending on the neighborhood. There is little or no commerce in the Red Wastes, except for what can be bartered with Gruul clansfolk or scavenged. The Bulwark carries many basic goods and services, with weapons and armor plentiful due to the constant threat of conflict and the nearby foundries in District Six. On Tin Street, almost anything is available for a bit of searching and the right price.

The precinct offers a wide range of food and lodging, appropriate for lifestyles from squalid to wealthy. The more affluent folk of the precinct are careful not to flaunt their wealth, lest they make themselves targets for raiders from the Red Wastes.

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who maintain either a squalid or aristocratic lifestyle could have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct Four.

#### LAW AND CRIME

Much of Precinct Four is a war zone, and mundane methods of law enforcement aren't always effective in such an environment. No one takes the constant patrolling of the Boros Legion as a guarantee of their safety, and almost all folk know how to fight to some degree. Typical threats include giant monsters, unstable elementals, and Gruul raiding parties, and a curfew system is often instituted when a neighborhood is beset by one of these dangers. The only area that is usually safe from external threats is Tin Street. Petty crimes aren't given much attention, since the soldiers are primarily concerned with curbing violence and mayhem. The typical response to a reported crime or a dangerous threat is 1d8 minutes, and the squad consists of a Boros Legion knight (from the Monster Manual) leading 4d4 soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block).

The Red Wastes is a lawless region mostly beyond the reach of Boros patrols and Azorius laws. In other parts of the precinct, goblin gangs shake down locals whenever possible and skirmish against each other over turf. The Shattergang Brothers are a notorious goblin gang that haunts Tin Street in this precinct, dealing in weapons and explosives.

# PRECINCT FIVE

As the home of prestigious universities, ancient libraries, and hidden laboratories, Precinct Five is the hub of information and learning in the Tenth District. People of all ages flock to this precinct to spend time learning, whether by poring over texts and scrolls or finding a mentor who will guide a student. It's also the place to find information brokers, who sell specialized or secret knowledge available nowhere else. Multilevel buildings set next to each other with little regard for planning give way to an occasional square or open campus where socially minded residents congregate during daytime hours. At night, many continue their studies while others tinker with their latest creations or intellectual endeavors. Taverns and pubs tend to be more urbane than in other parts of the district and often feature poetry readings, storytelling, and musical performances.

People who live in Precinct Five have a zeal for learning and tend to be inquisitive. Getting into a heated debate or touting a recent success to your neighbors is part of showing your worth. Good neighbors keep their projects and research hidden until a result can be displayed; it is considered uncouth to allow others to view a work in progress.

#### AFFILIATED GUILDS

Zonot Seven, the home of the Simic Combine's guildhall, is located on the western edge of the precinct. The Izzet League maintains a network of laboratories and workshops close to Nivix (in Precinct Four). House Dimir agents are seen and unseen all around

the district, and they secretly run the Ismeri Library. Some members of the Azorius Senate who prefer to study disciplines aside from the law make their homes here as well.

#### NEIGHBORHOODS AND LANDMARKS

Life for residents in Precinct Five is spent mostly indoors, or in the case of the Simic, underwater. The precinct's occupants-including significant populations of students, instructors, researchers, scribes, and university staff-are crowded into dormitories and apartments squeezed in among laboratories, libraries, and magical machinery.

#### ZONOT SEVEN

The Simic Combine's watery habitat is made up of huge sinkholes filled with the overflow from a subterranean ocean. Zonot Seven is the only zonot within Ravnica City proper, and it contains Zameck, the Simic guildhall. In contrast to the rest of the precinct, the zonot is a bustling place, with activity at all hours. A huge chamber just below the street surface serves as a gathering place for all the Simic speakers, as well as a place where visitors can meet with Prime Speaker Zegana or other Simic emissaries. A Simic researcher might invite a land-dwelling colleague to visit the habitat, but such an occurrence isn't common. Canals lead from here farther into the precinct and to Precinct Six.

#### THE BLISTERCOILS

A series of gigantic waterwheels, built and operated by the Izzet League, turns just outside Zonot Seven in the north end of the precinct. The system generates magical energy to power public works, Simic laboratories, and, of course, Izzet workshops. Few outside the Izzet realize that the amount of energy generated in the Blistercoils far exceeds what is actually used, with the excess stored in underground batteries that could explode if they became overloaded.

Blistercoils is also the name of the neighborhood near the waterwheels, which largely consists of workshops and private laboratories.

#### HIGHTOWER

The western end of the precinct is packed with educational institutions of all sorts, from grand universities that cover a broad span of disciplines to specialized schools that instruct students in subjects ranging from theoretical metaphysics to fine arts. The neighborhood takes its name from the fact that most of these schools boast at least one tall spire among their structures. Students and staff live both on and off the various campuses, and several cozy pubs and small lecture halls are busy from afternoons through late in the night.

#### PRISM UNIVERSITY

A crystal-paned center of learning that concentrates on magical theory and application, Prism University draws potential wizards and other would-be mages who want to learn about all forms of magic, in contrast to the specialized and practical applications of magic espoused by the guilds. Even though the school maintains a formal state of neutrality, it's an open secret that many guilds have infiltrated the university and planted agents to woo

prospective members. Partly as a result of this influence, many graduates of the university do go on to join a guild, finding a way to apply their broad experience to support the narrower focus of the guild. (A player character spellcaster might well be a graduate of the university, which could explain the character's ability to use magic that wouldn't normally be taught within their guild.)

#### ISMERI LIBRARY

One of the greatest libraries on all Ravnica, the Ismeri Library is open to all citizens at all hours. Hundreds of thousands of books covering every conceivable subject are found here. The place is also one of the centers of Dimir communication. Secret messages are hidden within its books by a variety of methods both magical and mundane. Dimir agents might have to gather message fragments hidden within several different documents, for example, to find their next assignments or targets. Intricate codes and magical wards protect other secrets.

### GOODS AND SERVICES

Specialty items that are commonly used by scribes, researchers, and inventors can be found in many small shops in the precinct, usually run by a tinker or academic. Precinct Five also has the best apothecaries, alchemists, and magic-mongers in the Tenth District. On the other hand, mundane adventuring gear, weapons, and armor are harder to find.

Information is an especially valuable commodity in Precinct Five. In addition to holding booksellers, the precinct is home to a variety of people who make a living (or at least a sizable side income) selling information, including private investigators, rumormongers, and spies.

Meals and lodging of modest to wealthy quality are available here. Older and more experienced peoplehigh-ranking Simic researchers or established scholars-tend to maintain lifestyles toward the more expensive end of that scale.

The poor are pitied and the most affluent are envied, so adventurers who maintain an aristocratic, poor, squalid, or wretched lifestyle, at the DM's discretion, could have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct Five.

### LAW AND CRIME

Much of the crime in Precinct Five is of a sort that is hard to detect: blackmail, espionage, identity theft (of the literal kind, perpetrated by shapechangers), and the like. Most of the precinct's residents spend their time absorbed in study, unaware that such activities might be happening under their noses. Only rarely does violence break out, and Azorius arresters try hard to keep the incident quiet and maintain public calm.

The typical response to a reported crime here is 1d12 minutes, and the force consists of two Azorius arresters (use the veteran stat block in the Monster Manual).

# PRECINCT SIX

Large warehouses, major thoroughfares, and nondescript worker tenements make the utilitarian Precinct Six a hub of activity for shipping, storage, and other mercantile concerns in the Tenth District. Wide cobblestone streets allow for the passage of beasts and constructs that transport raw goods from points beyond the Tenth and for the shipping of manufactured materials back to those locations. The demands of commerce keep the area constantly active, and the inconspicuous nature of the warehouses makes them popular as rendezvous points for all sorts of transactions, legal and illicit. At night, lurking undead and the horrors of the undercity, coming up from Deadbridge Chasm, keep wary citizens indoors, while a few people who deal in sinister magic seek the monsters out for nefarious purposes.

People who live in this working-class precinct are often practical-minded and thus tolerant of some degree of illicit activity. Being a good neighbor means keeping to yourself, unless you live in the Smelting Quarter, where the atmosphere is much more raucous.

#### AFFILIATED GUILDS

The Orzhov Syndicate owns many of the warehouses in the precinct and controls much of the commerce around Tin Street. Members of the Golgari Swarm often crawl around the edges of Deadbridge Chasm, which is an opening to their sprawling subterranean network. The Boros Legion rents many of the warehouses to store manufactured goods from the Smelting Quarter, and

Kamen Fortress houses a garrison to protect Boros interests. The Cult of Rakdos operates a number of pain clubs throughout the precinct, especially around Tin Street, and Rakdos street performances are more common in Precinct Six than anywhere else in the Tenth District.

#### NEIGHBORHOODS AND LANDMARKS

Precinct Six is home to many working-class folk, most packed into modest apartments near their place of work. It's also home to more than its share of monsters, most of which are active at night.

#### SMELTING QUARTER

The heart of the manufacturing industry in the Tenth District is at the north end of the precinct. The Smelting Quarter is smoky, hot, and filled with activity day and night. Goblins often make their homes near the factories on Foundry Street, preferring the constant activity to sleepier neighborhoods. Standing south and east of the quarter, Kamen Fortress is a Boros garrison dedicated to keeping watch on Rakdos activity. Clashes between the Boros Legion, the goblins, and the Cult of Rakdos are common throughout this part of the precinct.

#### GORE HOUSE

A Rakdos club called the Gore House, run by a viashino (lizardfolk) named Nyoser, occupies a defunct factory in the south end of the Smelting Quarter-and also houses the main entrance to the Demon's Vestibule, the stairway down to Rix Maadi.

#### MEDORI PARK

The western part of the precinct, Medori Park, is named after an Orzhov pontiff who converted a city park into a warehouse lot many years ago. This neighborhood is particularly rife with undead at night, both corporeal and incorporeal. Some serve dark masters and often guard valuables, while others pursue their own evil urges. The Orzhov Syndicate owns many large warehouses here, and the Boros Legion maintains facilities to store a variety of equipment used by their soldiers, including valuable weapons and armor. The most important facilities are heavily guarded-often by angels, whether Boros or Orzhov.

#### DEADBRIDGE CHASM

A gaping opening in the ground dominates the precinct and is lined with mossy stairs and fungal blooms. Deadbridge Chasm serves as an entrance to the Golgari's undercity realm and their guildhall, Korozda. The area smells of decomposition, an odor that grows particularly intense on hot days. Many kraul make their homes in the walls that line the cavernous descent, and Devkarin elves come up to the surface through this passage to trade on Tin Street.

#### WAYPORT

The neighborhood of Wayport rises like a pillar from the midst of Deadbridge Chasm, and a number of bridges, large and small, connect it to the surrounding city of multiple vertical levels. Many goods traded with other districts are funneled along Tin Street, often pausing in Wayport's warehouses along the way. But only the wealthiest merchants can afford storage space here.

#### BENZER'S BRIDGE

This wide bridge is a main thoroughfare for cargo traveling to and from districts beyond the Tenth. A small market is located here, complete with shops and restaurants, all of which close after dark. Secret pain clubs, hidden below the market in dark rooms inside the bridge itself, come alive after sunset.

#### GOODS AND SERVICES

Trade goods can easily be acquired in Precinct Six, along with manufactured items such as artisan's tools. Weapons, armor, and mounts are rarely on sale here. Fences deal in stolen and otherwise illicit goods. On Tin Street, which runs along the eastern side of the precinct, most anything can be had for the right price.

Meals and lodging of poor to modest quality meet the needs of the laborers, dock hands, and street performers of Precinct Six for a price they can afford. The wealthy are viewed as outsiders, and the truly impoverished are generally shunned.

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who maintain a lifestyle less expensive than poor or more expensive than modest could have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct Six.

#### LAW AND CRIME

ONAS DE RO

The folk of Precinct Six are pragmatic, not overly concerned with the welfare of others, and thus often willing

to disregard minor crimes. Arresters from the Azorius Senate can often be found on patrol in and around the warehouses. Soldiers from the Boros Legion are common near the warehouses and in the Smelting Quarter. The typical response time to a reported crime in these areas is 2d10 minutes, and the squad consists of two Boros soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block). At night or in the Smelting Quarter, a response to an attack might instead consist of 1d4 Boros soldiers led by a sergeant (use the knight stat block in the Monster Manual).

Precinct Six is a hotbed for illicit activity, particularly organized crime. Goblin gangs haunt the Smelting Ouarter, most notably a large gang that claims Foundry Street, led by a goblin named Krenko. Vicious turf wars sometimes erupt in that area. Violent crimes occur with regularity all over the precinct, with most of the bodies ending up in Deadbridge Chasm. Night-lurking monsters are a particular problem in the precinct as well, often attacking and disappearing before help can arrive.

# CHAPTER 4: CREATING ADVENTURES

HIS CHAPTER PROVIDES A TOOLBOX TO HELP the Dungeon Master create adventures featuring the guilds of Ravnica. The tensions among the guilds, a constant current of animosity. provide a solid foundation for building adventures. "Krenko's Way," a sample adventure at the end of this

chapter, can be used to launch a Ravnica campaign. The tables and advice in this chapter expand on the material in chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Monsters and nonplayer characters mentioned on the tables can be found either in the Monster Manual or in chapter 6 of this book. When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. If the stat block appears elsewhere, the text tells you so.

# GUILD-BASED ADVENTURES

Each guild gets a section in this chapter to help you craft adventures inspired by that guild. In a guild's section, four basic seeds for creating adventures are provided: guild locations, guild villains, character objectives, and adventure hooks.

### GUILD LOCATIONS

Each guild's entry in this chapter includes a map of an iconic location associated with the guild. Any of these sites can serve as the location for an adventure.

The description of each guild location includes a table that lists possible goals for an adventure based there. You can choose an adventure goal, or roll one randomly, from the table in the description of the site you've chosen. If none of those goals inspires you, choose a goal or roll one randomly from the Guild Location Goals table instead.

#### GUILD LOCATION GOALS

#### d8 Adventure Goal

- Prevent a magical catastrophe inside the location. l
- 2 Find the source of strange occurrences in or near the location.
- 3 Escape the location (and help others escape) when a disaster occurs inside.
- 4 Quell a riot inside or around the location.
- 5 Kill or drive out a monster that has turned the location into its lair.
- 6 Defend the location against an external attacker.
- 7 Seize control of the location.
- Infiltrate the location and report on what's happen-8 ing inside.

#### LINKED LOCATIONS

You can create an adventure that links two locations together. The Location Connections table offers broad suggestions for how you might lead your players from one adventure location to another.

#### LOCATION CONNECTIONS

| de | Adventure Connection |
| --- | --- |
|  | Transport a person, an object, or information |
|  | collected at the first location safely to the second. |
| 2 | Plant something taken from the first location |
|  | THE THE THE CONSULTION THE CHANGE CHANGE LEASE STANDARD STATES CANADA CONSULTION CONSU |

- inside the second to incriminate someone in the second location.
- 3 Do the same thing at the second location as was done at the first.
- 4 Uncover the source of interference encountered at the first location, which lies in the second.
- Follow a fleeing foe or trail a suspicious figure from 5 the first location to the second.
- 6 Follow up on information gained at the first location by investigating the second.

### GUILD VILLAINS

Player characters might belong to any guild, and their adversaries might as well. The guild entries in this chapter offer examples of the kinds of villains and villainous schemes that might be connected to each guild.

Certain kinds of goals and schemes are common to villains in every guild. Some generic villainous schemes appear on the Guild Villains table. You can also use the Villain's Scheme and Villain's Methods tables in chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to flesh out a villain's activities, and a guild's section in this chapter points to specific parts of those tables that characterize how villains from that guild enact their plans.

#### GUILD VILLAINS

| de | Villainous Activity |
| --- | --- |
| A | A villain is attempting to disgrace or discredit a |
|  | powerful person. |
| 2 | A villain is striving for power within their guild. |
| 3 | A villain has claimed power in their guild and |
|  | needs to be supplanted. |
| র্য | The villain is sending agents to infiltrate one or |
|  | more guilds. |
|  | The villain's agents are luring members away from |
|  | another guild. |
| 6 | The villain's agents are sabotaging the operations |
|  | of another guild. |

### CHARACTER OBJECTIVES

The impetus for adventuring might come from within the player characters' own guilds, rather than from external guilds. Each guild entry in this chapter provides some examples of missions that the guild might send its members on. These missions can also serve as side quests that a character is asked to fulfill while engaged in a larger task that involves the whole party.

#### GUILD CHARACTER OBJECTIVES

#### d8 Adventure Goal

- 17 Find an item that is important to the guild.
- 2 Get information from a guild member.
- 3 Protect or rescue a guild member in the midst of a catastrophe.
- 4 Free a guild member from captivity.
- 5 Find a missing guild member.
- 6 Kill or capture an enemy of the guild.
- 7 Help a guild member who's in trouble with the law.
- 8 Recruit someone to join the guild.

### ADVENTURE HOOKS

Each guild section includes a table of adventure hooksevents that might drive adventures but don't necessarily involve specific locations or villains. They offer a general description of circumstances that can lead to adventure.

# CHOOSING A GUILD

Here are the main ways to approach the choice of guild for your adventure:

- · Choose a guild that has an aesthetic or a story that excites you and that will lead to the sort of villain or type of adventure you want to build. The following section, "Adventure Types," shows how different guilds are natural fits for certain types of adventure.
- Pick a guild that fits your players' tastes. The introduction to the Dungeon Master's Guide offers some guidance for crafting adventures to please different kinds of players. The guild or guilds your players choose will also help you understand your players' desires. It's a

#### QUICK BUILD

To make a simple location-based adventure quickly, follow these steps:

- 1. Choose a guild (or use the Guilds table in chapter 1 if you want to choose randomly). The adventure will take place in that guild's location, as described in this chapter.
- 2. Determine the adventure goal using the table associated with that location.
- 3. Use creatures associated with the guild (shown on the tables in chapter 6) to populate the location.

Optionally, you can use the Location Connections table in this chapter to link the location you're using to a second location. You can either select a location based on the result of that table or determine the second location randomly.

safe bet that a player who creates a Rakdos character is looking for mayhem and combat, while a Dimir player is more interested in intrigue and sabotage. Armed with that understanding, you can better craft an adventure experience aimed at your players.

- Go with a guild that easily provides a villain to face. A few guilds make very straightforward villains: Gruul, Rakdos, Dimir, and Golgari.
- · Let a die decide the guild, using the Random Guilds table in this book's introduction.

The guild you choose will provide a potential location, villain, mission, or adventure hook, as well as point you toward the type of adventure you're going to run.

#### ADVENTURE TYPES

Certain guilds lend themselves to particular types of adventures better than others, as shown below. If you're interested in running an intrigue adventure, where the heroes must unravel twisted plots within plots, you'll want to choose a different guild from what you would select if you want to run a dungeon delve that will take the adventurers into the labyrinthine undercity.

#### DUNGEON DELVE

Beneath the urban environment of Ravnica is an entirely different city-the dark, dank undercity, where vermin and horrors lurk and the Golgari Swarm maintains its elegant courts. Indeed, thousands of years of development have buried countless layers of construction beneath the current surface streets, making the undercity much larger than the surface city, though much of it is inaccessible. But if a sinkhole or other catastrophe opens long-sealed vaults and exposes them to the surface again, who knows what horrors might be revealed?

#### DUNGEON DELVE GUILDS

#### WILDERNESS

Though the world is covered with streets and buildings, Ravnica also has its wilderness areas, including the ruined rubblebelts haunted by the Gruul and the sylvan wilds cultivated by the Selesnya.

#### WILDERNESS GUILDS

| વર | Guild |
| --- | --- |
| 1-4 | Gruul Clans |
| 5-6 | Selesnya Conclave |

#### PLOTS AND INTRIGUE

Every guild has its internal politics, making it easy for characters to get caught up in intrigue-particularly within their own guilds. Certain guilds are more likely to involve themselves in the politics of other guilds, which makes them particularly good villains for intrigue-based adventures.

#### MYSTERY

Ravnica is rife with crime, presenting law-abiding adventurers with ample opportunity to put their mystery-solving skills to the test. Identifying a guild assassin, tracking a stolen treasure, or unmasking a corrupt bureaucrat could all fall into this category. Of course, the adventurers need not be virtuous or law-abiding themselves: the Orzhov are more apt to send their own enforcers after thieves than they are to turn to the forces of law for assistance.

### GUILD VERSUS GUILD

Interguild conflict is such a fundamental aspect of life on Ravnica that the player characters' guild membership is an easy starting point for choosing an adventure villain. If you choose a villain from a guild that's already in conflict with one or more guilds that the characters belong to, it's easy to craft villainous goals that are at odds with the characters' goals.

If all the player characters belong to a single guild, choosing almost any other guild will provide opportunities for conflict. The natural state of the relationship between any two guilds is tension at best, and open warfare at worst. All it takes is a villain willing to upset the balance of power, and the characters' guild or their own motivations should easily bring them into conflict with the villain. A party's own guild could even provide a villain, given the amount of scheming and intrigue that exists even within the guilds. A guild official gone rogue, members of the same guild at odds with one another, or even a corrupt guildmaster can put characters in conflict with their own guild.

If the characters come from different guilds, a common enemy provides a good reason for them to work together. Any guild that isn't represented by one of the characters is a fine choice for a villain.

# INVOLVING THE CHARACTERS

Once you've chosen an adventure seed-a villain, a mission, or a general hook-you need to figure out what gets the player characters involved in the adventure. The answer could be as simple as a guildmaster or other authority sending them on a mission, but it's generally good to hook the characters in personally. What motivation do they have to thwart the villain?

The best answers to this question stem either from the adventurers' personalities, ideals, and histories, or from their guild affiliations. The characters might have a common reason to fight the villain (especially if they all belong to the same guild or have been adventuring together for a while), or they might all oppose the villain for different reasons.

For example, say your villain is a group of Gruul anarchs raiding in a densely populated area. A Boros character might be assigned to protect innocent bystanders, or might just happen to be in the area and leap to the defense of the innocents. An Izzet character might be trying to make sure that an Izzet laboratory in the area isn't damaged or its secrets looted. A Dimir spy might leap at the opportunity to steal some Izzet secrets when the laboratory comes under attack.

The Cross Purposes table can help you involve the characters in an adventure by suggesting ways that a villain's activities might directly conflict with the player characters' goals or interests.

#### CROSS PURPOSES

| d10 | The Villain's Activities ... |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | ... directly target one or more characters. The ad- |
|  | venture begins when characters are attacked by the |
|  | villain's agents. |
| 2 | ... threaten a character's contact or bond. |
| 3 | ... challenge a character's ideal or exploit a flaw. |
|  | The character might hear rumors of this activity, |
|  | spurring them into action. |
| 4 | ... open an opportunity for a character to pursue a |
|  | personal goal. |
| ર | ... compete with a character's guild. A guild |
|  | authority might order the character to rectify the |
|  | situation. |
| 6 | ... threaten guild members or property. |
| 7 | ... conflict with guild goals. |
| 8 | ... open an opportunity for a guild to pursue its |
|  | own agenda. |
| ਰੇ | ... catch the characters between fighting forces. |
| 10 | ... cause an accident or catastrophe that traps the |
|  | characters. |

# COMPLICATIONS

An adventure that pits player characters against a single guild is relatively straightforward, but adding another guild can make an adventure even more interesting.

The involvement of a second guild can be as simple as the appearance of a bumbling innocent who needs the characters' protection, or as complex as a second villain who pursues an entirely separate scheme. The Secondary Guild Role table presents a range of options.

#### SECONDARY GUILD ROLE

- d8 Secondary Guild Role
- l A rival pursues the same goal as the adventurers, but is doing it "wrong."
- 2 One or more members of another guild are caught between the villain and the adventurers.
- 3 A group of NPC adventurers from another guild confront the same villain for different reasons.
- 4 Someone is manipulating the villain for their own purposes.
- 5 A known rival or enemy meddles in the adventure, hoping the adventurers will fail.
- 6 A known rival or enemy can provide essential help in stopping the villain.
- 7 A second villain's plot is unfolding at the same time but is otherwise unrelated.
- 8 A second villain is in competition with the first one.

### GUILD INTRIGUE

Intrigue in Ravnica most often involves interaction between two guilds, so you can use the Guild Intrigue table to find the nugget of a plot. The villain tables in the guild entries can help you determine the nature and motivations of the individuals involved.

#### GUILD INTRIGUE

#### de Adventure Goal

- l Guilds are vying for influence over a prominent individual (who might be a player character).
- 2 Guilds are competing for control of a key site or swath of territory.
- 3 Guilds are locked in a deadly feud but might be open to a peace negotiation.
- 4 Villains from two or more guilds are forming a dangerous alliance.
- 5 A villain is trying to disrupt an alliance between two or more guilds.
- 6 Splinter factions from two guilds are trying to form a new guild.

#### RANDOM NONPLAYER CHARACTERS

Any time you need an NPC for an adventure-for example, if the player characters are sent on a mission to rescue a member of their guild-you can use the contacts tables in chapter 2 to help flesh out the NPC. If you don't know the NPC's guild affiliation, you can roll on the Random Guilds table in this book's introduction to determine the guild. Then you can choose an appropriate stat block in chapter 6 to represent the NPC's game statistics.

#### ALLIES AND RIVALS

A friendly contact can act as a patron, sending a character on a mission or a side quest either as a formal assignment or as a favor. Friendly contacts also have a knack for getting into perilous situations from which they need to be rescued, which can sometimes force characters into making difficult choices between saving friendly nonplayer characters and capturing villainous ones. In extraordinary circumstances, a friendly contact might even join the adventuring party for a short time.

Contacts who have a more antagonistic relationship with a character can hinder the adventuring party's efforts in a variety of ways. They might appear at inconvenient times to delay the party, or catch the group in the midst of some illegal activity. They might leak information to the adventure's villain, subtly aid the villain's efforts, or even become villains themselves.

Contacts can complicate things even more when they interact with multiple player characters or with each other. Consider what might happen when two people who are friendly contacts for two different characters are bitter enemies of each other, or when a single NPC is a good friend of one character and a rival of another. The characters might have to navigate those complex relationships in order to achieve their goals.

# AZORIUS SENATE

Adventures involving the Azorius Senate naturally revolve around law enforcement. Player characters who find themselves on the wrong side of the law might be forced to confront well-meaning Azorius arresters as enemies, even if the characters are innocent of any wrongdoing. Lawful characters might also assist the Azorius in maintaining law and order on the mean streets of Ravnica.

### ARRESTER STATION

Map 4.1 depicts an arrester station, which serves as the law enforcement hub for a precinct or neighborhood.

#### ARRESTER STATION ADVENTURES

Characters might be drawn to the arrester station because of prisoners held there, information or items stored there, or crimes occurring there. The Arrester Station Adventures table presents some possibilities.

#### ARRESTER STATION ADVENTURES

#### d12 Adventure Goal

- Break out of the holding cells. ]
- Break someone else out of the holding cells. 2
- Stop someone before they can give information to 3 the arresters or testify before a judge.
- Protect a prisoner from assassins. 4
- 5 Get information from or to someone in the holding cells.
- Apprehend a former prisoner who used magic to 6 take over the station and drive the guards away.
- 7 Retrieve something held as evidence.
- Find proof that the captain of this station is 8 corrupt.

- 11 Steal the arresters' files about a criminal or a case.
- 12 Intercept a message being sent to or from the station.

#### ARRESTER STATION MAP

Two separate buildings make up this station, separated by an elevated plaza. One end of the station includes a courthouse (the lower level) and a prison (upper level).

Wide, impressive stairs lead to the main courthouse entrance, which opens into a large waiting room. All the doors leading out of the waiting room are kept locked, so they can be opened only from the other side. To either side of the waiting room are private meeting rooms, which lead back to an extensive area of offices for the large staff that keeps the place running.

The twin courtrooms include bench seats for spectators and witnesses. The judges preside from platforms that hover in midair, with shallow pools of water below. The accused are seated on balconies that overlook the same pools. Doors at the back of these balconies lead to a central hallway that ends at a staircase that ascends to the prison level.

Direct access to the prison area from outside the building is provided by two long, narrow staircases that lead up from the plaza. The stairs end at a balcony that is guarded at all times by archers behind arrow slits. A narrow hall leads through several locked doors to the cells-the general population on one side, where prisoners are allowed to mingle to some extent, and a high-security area on the other side, featuring smaller cells keeping prisoners in complete isolation.

The opposite end of the station is a headquarters for a local detachment of arresters. The main level includes two meeting rooms, an office for the commander, and a break room. The upper level provides working space where arresters can interview suspects and complete paperwork, as well as space for storing evidence. The lower level includes a morgue and a large area where the whole local force can be assembled.

### AZORIUS VILLAINS

Examples of Azorius villains appear in the Azorius Villains table.

#### AZORIUS VILLAINS

| 98 | Villain |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | An ambitious authority figure seeks to achieve a |
|  | higher rank by framing or defaming a rival. |

- 6 certain class of people.
- 7 A precognitive mage (see chapter 6 for the stat block) invents visions designed to frame enemies.
- 8 A cowardly bureaucrat destroys evidence to hide someone else's involvement in a crime.

#### AZORIUS AS CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

The Azorius become villains when they abuse the power of the law. A local magistrate might imprison innocent people, or the senate might pass oppressive legislation, thereby drawing the ire of the Boros and the Selesnya, who care about the folk who get caught in the crosshairs. Arresters might decide to crack down on unsafe Izzet laboratory practices, illegal Rakdos performances, or the Gruul presence in the city. Self-righteous prison wardens or precinct captains might abuse their authority in the name of the law, and corrupt bureaucrats might use their positions to garner favors for themselves and their relatives.

Low-level characters might suffer harassment at the hands of overzealous arresters. As the campaign progresses, they might be able to identify a particular imperator who is driving this heightened aggression,

MAP 4.1: ARRESTER STATION

who then becomes something of a nemesis for them. As they gain experience, this imperator continues to be a thorn in their side and advances through the ranks of the senate as well, becoming a minister and eventually the arbiter who dictates law enforcement policy for the entire guild. Along the way, this villain uses every available means to hinder the characters, probably veering into covert illegal activities (evil means for a good end). The climax of the campaign might involve a violent confrontation with this arbiter and a group of arresters, or a tense verbal argument adjudicated by Supreme Judge Isperia herself.

### AZORIUS CHARACTER GOALS

Characters who are members of the Azorius Senate might be sent on missions of law enforcement by their superiors or contacts in the guild, and trusted characters might be tasked with apprehending criminals without killing them. The examples on the Azorius Assignments table might be side quests specific to an Azorius character, undertaken while a party of adventurers is engaged in a larger mission.

# BOROS LEGION

Adventures involving the Boros Legion might have a military bent, focusing on small-scale conflict between groups of Boros soldiers and bands of rioters or raiders. The legion is generally a prominent force for law and good in Ravnica, which makes it an appropriate home guild for noble-minded player characters. Its holy bent also makes villains drawn from its ranks particularly dangerous and perhaps tragic.

### LEGION GARRISON

The Boros Legion maintains garrisons throughout Ravnica, ensuring that every neighborhood has a strong military presence. They range from towering fortresses to small bunkers like the one shown in map 4.2.

#### LEGION GARRISON ADVENTURES

Designed with defense foremost, a Boros garrison is well suited for adventures that challenge the characters to find a way in or fight their way out. The Legion Garrison Adventures table offers a number of possibilities.

#### LEGION GARRISON ADVENTURES

#### d12 Adventure Goal

- l Lay siege to the garrison.
- 2 Break a siege at the garrison.
- 3 Sabotage the building's defenses so someone else can break into the garrison.
- 4 Find a hidden explosive charge in the garrison before it detonates.
- 5 Steal a magic weapon held inside the garrison.
- 6 Discover evidence that incriminates an officer in the garrison.
- 7 Identify a spy among the garrison's soldiers before the spy can escape.
- 8 Help a spy get safely out of the garrison without being discovered.
- 9 Capture a garrison officer for interrogation.
- Shore up the garrison's defenses before an assault. 10
- 11 Clear out the monsters infesting a garrison that was abandoned years ago.
- 12 Steal plans for future Boros military action.

#### LEGION GARRISON MAP

Access to the garrison is limited to a pair of 20-foot-wide walkways elevated above street level and protected by archers behind arrow slits. Two antechambers give the Boros soldiers and angels ample opportunity to screen anyone who seeks to gain entrance. Beyond them is a large hall where troops can be mustered. To one side of the mustering hall is a barracks area, with a kitchen, a mess, food storage, and guest quarters on the other side.

An extensive array of wall niches in the lower tier (at street level) provides storage space for archived records and the like, and a basement beneath that includes food storage and a well for fresh water, enabling the garrison to withstand a long siege.

The upper tier includes more large halls, the commander's quarters and office, and several niches-accessible only by flying from outside the garrison-that serve as living quarters and watch-posts for the angels stationed here. Parapets on the rooftop provide cover for humanoid archers as well, and the broad open space that they surround offers room for training and sparring. Grass-covered ridges separate different training areas and add a contrasting touch of nature's beauty to the otherwise stony building.

### BOROS VILLAINS

Examples of Boros villains appear in the Boros Villains table.

- 4 Believing that they are harboring terrorists, a Boros brigadier is slaughtering helpless people in transient communities in the undercity.
- 5 A squad of corrupt Boros soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block) is extorting money from local merchants.
- 6 A Boros commander under the thumb of another guild is turning a blind eye to the violence perpetrated by that guild.
- 7 An overzealous angel has risen up against innocent people, including the soldiers in her own garrison, believing that they harbor evil in their hearts.
- 8 A crazed angel demands to be worshiped as a god.

#### BOROS AS CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

Not too long ago, the leaders of the Boros Legion valued zeal more highly than justice, believing that their military might made their cause right and just. Although the current guildmaster, Aurelia, has reversed her stance on the issue, some voices within the legion still espouse these views. Boros villains are typically intolerant, self-righteous warmongers who abuse their power

ODOT MOSA

MAP 4.2: LEGION GARRISON

in pursuit of their own private visions of justice. And because the lower echelons of the guild are taught to follow orders without question, even the villains among the Boros can command companies of soldiers to help them carry out their schemes.

Boros villains are inclined to engage in activity that involves pursuing one's passion, acquiring power, or exacting retribution. The Boros make good campaign antagonists if the adventurers represent the forces of chaos that the legion opposes-Rakdos revelers, Gruul raiders, Golgari corrupters, or Dimir spies.

You could structure a campaign around the legion's slow progress in taking over the authority of the Azorius Senate and imposing a sort of martial law on the city. A campaign of this sort is particularly effective if the characters initially work alongside the Boros, especially if one or more characters belong to the legion. They might help Boros soldiers drive off Gruul raiders or uproot Dimir spies-clearly fighting against evil on the side of the good and just. As time goes on, though, their Boros allies might start taking their war against evil too far. Innocent citizens get caught in the crossfire, most punishment is cruel and excessive, and any resistance is met with overwhelming force, to "set an example" for anyone else who might consider opposing the legion. A Boros ally (or even a close friend) of the characters might become fully caught up in this fervor. Perhaps the characters can talk some sense into their old friend, but the resolution of the campaign might force them to take more extreme measures to curb the legion's excesses.

#### BOROS CHARACTER GOALS

The Boros Legion sends individuals or small parties on small-scale military missions, usually to help quell riots or protect bystanders from dangerous situations. Trusted characters might also be involved in internal investigations of suspected wrongdoing, especially if they're associated with the Wojek League. The Boros Assignments table provides examples of missions or side quests that Boros characters might undertake.

#### BOROS ASSIGNMENTS

#### de Assignment

- ] Help quell a Rakdos riot or hold back Gruul raiders, or otherwise maintain the peace while protecting innocent bystanders.

- 4 Escort an important person safely from one place to another.

# HOUSE DIMIR

Masters of misdirection, infiltration, and espionage, Dimir spies and assassins pursue their objectives behind layers of deception. Dimir agents make ideal villains for adventures involving intrigue and mystery in the shadows of dark alleys and the tunnels of the undercity.

### SAFE HOUSE

House Dimir maintains safe houses throughout Ravnica, many of them tucked away in the undercity, for guild members who need to elude the ready reach of the law. These sites are protected by magical wards that confuse and misdirect all who approach-in particular, spells that make intruders forget where they are or what they're doing there.

A safe house can also be used to hold prisoners for interrogation, with its protections equally effective in preventing escape and in deterring intruders. Often, a single site serves both purposes.

Map 4.3 presents the floor plan of a typical Dimir safe house.

#### SAFE HOUSE ADVENTURES

The first task in almost any mission involving a Dimir safe house is to find the place. Most people who have been to a safe house or its environs have no memory of the event, thanks to Dimir mind magic.

The Safe House Adventures table offers some reasons why characters might need to visit such a location. In addition, you could use any other guild's sample location as the site for a location-based adventure, with a simple mission: uncover a Dimir spy in that location.

#### SAFE HOUSE ADVENTURES

#### d12 Adventure Goal

- l Find a fugitive hiding in the safe house.
- Liberate someone being held in the safe house. 2
- 3 Retrieve a stolen item.
- Get information from a prisoner in the safe house 4 without revealing that information to the Dimir.
- Acquire information from a Dimir agent to unmask 5 a spy embedded in another guild.
- Escape from captivity in the safe house. 6
- 7 Plant a magical surveillance device inside the safe house.
- 8 Damage or destroy the safe house so the Dimir can't use it anymore.
- 9 Prevent the creation of a horror (see chapter 6) in the safe house. (You can replace the horror with a different creature from the Monster Manual.)
- Find and kill a mind drinker vampire (see chapter 6 10 for the stat block) or other monster that is picking off the safe house's inhabitants.
- Disable the safe house's wards and plant a beacon 11 inside it so that members of another guild can find and raid the place.
- 12 After stumbling into the safe house accidentally, get out with memories intact.

#### SAFE HOUSE WARDS

You can make a Dimir safe house hard to find and hard to get into by using some of these options:

- . The safe house is underground and accessible only through a maze of tunnels and crevices.
- . The area surrounding the house is protected by a guards and wards spell. Navigating the ancient underground corridors or the modern alleyways above ground becomes more complicated when intersections are clouded by fog, doors are hidden and magically locked, and magical compulsions drive visitors away.
- . A glyph of warding might cast fear, phantasmal force, or crown of madness on a character who triggers it-or simply explode in a blast of cold energy.
- Dimir agents might use alarm spells to ensure that they know when intruders are approaching the safe house.

#### SAFE HOUSE MAP

This safe house is a domed building encased in a stone exoskeleton characteristic of Dimir construction. The ground level is a comfortable living space that features accommodations for at least five people. It has five bedrooms, abundant storage space, a central lounge, a recreation space, a dining room, a kitchen, and a pantry.

A secret door in the back of a shared closet leads to a spiral staircase that descends to the basement, which contains three small holding cells. A watch post at the end of the hall allows a guard to keep an eye on the cells and anyone coming down the stairs. An interrogation room can be outfitted with equipment designed to extract information. One-way mirrors offer a view on the interrogation proceedings from an observation room.

#### DIMIR VILLAINS

The Dimir can be masterfully sly villains. Example villains appear in the Dimir Villains table.

| 8 | Roll on another guild's villain table, but the villain |

#### DIMIR AS CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

Dimir villains favor schemes involving captivity and coercion, defamation, impersonation and disguise, murder, politics, theft, and torture. Perhaps the most insidious technique employed by the Dimir is the erasing and modifying of memories.

Because their tendrils reach into every other guild, Dimir villains could turn out to be the link between plots that initially seem to be unconnected. Even when individual missions might be straightforward dungeon crawls or battles in the streets, the campaign revolves around the mystery of determining the true villain.

At low and middle levels, the characters might find themselves engaged in important but apparently unrelated tasks. They might kill or drive off a monster that is lairing in an abandoned arrester station (unwittingly clearing the way for a Dimir agent to be placed in the station). They might help the Boros capture a dangerous Rakdos ringleader (who is actually a Dimir agent working to destabilize Azorius influence). They might unmask a Dimir spy within one of their own guilds (who is an internal rival of the Dimir villain).

As the characters advance in level, they might come to realize that a powerful and ambitious Azorius figure is going too far in spying on the populace, despite that guild's great success in using precognitive mages to arrest evildoers-especially Dimir spies. Ultimately, the Azorius villain is revealed to be a high-ranking Dimir agent, a confidant of Lazav or even Lazav himself, who is trying to take over the Azorius Senate and turn it into a surveillance and espionage organization under the villain's control.

### DIMIR CHARACTER GOALS

Characters who are members of House Dimir are spies and saboteurs. It's possible to let these characters experience all the most enjoyable tropes of the spy genre while skirting the more sinister aspects of House Dimir.

The missions on the Dimir Assignments table can work for a team of Dimir agents or as secret missions for a Dimir character to pursue under the cover of the larger adventure plot.

# GOLGARI SWARM

A dominant force in the undercity, the Golgari Swarm is ideally suited for dungeon-based adventures. The Golgari represent corruption and decay, counting many villains among their ranks even though most members are mainly concerned with the balance of the natural cycle of life and death.

### UNDERCITY MANSION

The Golgari are a strange underground aristocracy in a city that mostly lacks a noble class; they are like throwbacks to an ancient time when one's birth determined one's station. The mansion depicted in map 4.4 is a stately relic of such a time-a grand hall that happens to be buried hundreds of feet beneath the streets of Ravnica.

#### UNDERCITY MANSION ADVENTURES

The Undercity Mansion Adventures table provides some possible challenges based in and around the Golgari undercity mansion.

#### UNDERCITY MANSION ADVENTURES

- d10 Adventure Goal
- l Find the source of a noxious fog rising from the undercity and poisoning a surface neighborhood.
- 2 Rescue several citizens being held hostage by Ochran agents.
- 3 Find the daytime lair of an elusive monster that hunts on the surface at night.
- 4 Rescue a guild member petrified by an undercity medusa (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that uses the mansion as its lair.
- 5 Take shelter in the mansion to escape a horrible monster prowling the undercity.
- 6 Win a bet by surviving a night inside.
- 7 Escape from captivity here.
- 8 Find a fugitive hiding here.
- 9 Find and claim a treasure hidden in the mansion.
- 10 Attend a masked ball held in the mansion in order to get information from another guest.

#### UNDERCITY MANSION MAP

This structure is built in a large depression, perhaps part of Deadbridge Chasm. A bridge crosses just above it, and a wide, curving stair leads down from the bridge to the grand ballroom on the top level of the mansion. The rest of the structure is built down from there, with the main, elegant halls and parlors on the second level. Notably, a wide hallway on this level connects with a passage leading to other areas of the undercity. A couple of areas on this floor have crumbled with the weight of the ages, but the place retains its stately grandeur.

The bottom level might be a basement excavated in the floor of a chasm, or it could hang above still more open space like a giant stalactite. It includes living quarters for the owners, servants, and guests.

### GOLGARI VILLAINS

Examples of Golgari villains appear in the Golgari Villains table.

### GOLGARI VILLAINS

- d8 Villain
l

- Armed with a powerful magic item found among the dead in the undercity, a Golgari shaman (see chapter 6 for the stat block) enacts a plan of revenge against another guild.
- 2 A kraul death priest (see chapter 6 for the stat block) is seeking a way to revive the ancient gods of Ravnica and destroy the world.
- 3 A Devkarin lich (see chapter 6 for the stat block) is capturing living subjects and infecting them with an insidious, mind-controlling fungus.
- 4 A trophy-hunting undercity medusa (see chapter 6 for the stat block) is on a killing spree, petrifying victims in interesting poses.
- 5 A Golgari shaman (see chapter 6 for the stat block) is spreading a fungal infection that transforms its dead victims into zombies.
- 6 An elf child lures citizens into the sewers, where a monstrous "pet" is waiting to kill and eat them.
- 7 Pursuing a personal vendetta, an Ochran assassin is targeting members of a certain guild and trying to ensure that their bodies are never found.
- A kraul death priest (see chapter 6 for the stat 8 block), angry at the way the Golgari have treated the kraul in the past, is killing the elves and medusas of the guild, hoping to eventually take Jarad's place as guildmaster.

#### GOLGARI AS CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

Given their affinity for death, necromancy, and decay, the Golgari make excellent villains. Because they consider life and death as equal parts of the natural cycle, they have no qualms about subjecting entire neighborhoods to poisonous gas or strangling vines to achieve their various goals. When a Golgari assassin goes on a killing spree, when a patch of their vegetative growth begins "reclaiming" an area that isn't yet abandoned, or when their fungus-bearing zombies emerge from the undercity to haunt the city streets, heroes are duty bound to act against the threat.

The Golgari possess a combination of ambition and ruthlessness that makes them extremely dangerous adversaries. The tension among the various factions of the swarm (the elves, the medusas, the kraul, and the rising erstwhile) adds an element of instability to the

mix. But perhaps the Golgari Swarm's most dangerous quality is the widespread confidence among its members that it will survive any catastrophe that might befall the surface world. This certainty means Golgari villains will stop at nothing in an attempt to provoke such an event-triggering a virulent plague, causing explosive plant growth, or inciting the other guilds into open war. for example. Over the course of a campaign, a group of adventurers might foil Golgari plans to accomplish all these things, or the characters might be constantly struggling against one ongoing disaster.

For example, the characters might spend the early part of the campaign resolving disputes between guilds, unaware that the Golgari are actually the instigators of those conflicts. Perhaps incidental to these missions, they also face a spore druid who is in the early stages of testing a terrible plague. Then, as the campaign reaches higher levels, the plague breaks out again. this time spreading rapidly. The crisis heightens tensions among the other guilds, especially when food sources are threatened. At the climax of the campaign, the heroes must defuse conflict among the guilds while finding a way to get at the druid at the cause of it all, who is locked in an undercity mansion waiting out the catastrophe.

### GOLGARI CHARACTER GOALS

Characters who are members of the Golgari Swarm might be sent on missions into the undercity, particularly jobs that involve retrieval or salvage. The secretive agents of the Ochran are more likely to pursue goals that call for theft or even assassination, while shamans could participate in the swarm's work of "reclamation" in surface neighborhoods. The Golgari Assignments table reflects this range of possibilities. An assignment can also serve as a side quest for Golgari adventurers to undertake while pursuing a larger goal with a mixedguild party.

#### GOLGARI ASSIGNMENTS

#### de Assignment

- l Find a valuable item believed lost in the undercity.
- 2 Retrieve a corpse in the undercity.

- 4 Poor people who subsist on Golgari food contract a dangerous, contagious magical infection.
- 5 Several kraul have moved into an old tenement and are making their neighbors nervous.
- 6 A beloved statue, long assumed to be the image of some forgotten community hero, suddenly returns to life after being petrified for a hundred years.

# GRUUL CLANS

An adventure involving the Gruul Clans typically revolves around combat. The Gruul provide characters with opportunities to fight huge monsters and vicious berserkers. The Gruul bring chaos and destruction with them wherever they go, so they can easily disrupt and complicate adventures involving any other guild. Any time an adventure needs an injection of brutal violence, the Gruul are a good tool for the purpose.

### RUBBLEBELT ENCAMPMENT

The Gruul have no interest in the buildings, streets, and markets of Ravnica, except as targets for their raids. The encampment shown in map 4.5 represents a temporary shelter in the ruins, the sort of place the Gruul might call home for a time.

#### RUBBLEBELT ENCAMPMENT ADVENTURES

Many Gruul adventures begin with a raid into a settled part of the city. Adventurers might be able to follow the raiders back to their camp-for the sake of revenge, in an effort to retrieve something, or perhaps in chains.

#### RUBBLEBELT ENCAMPMENT ADVENTURES

#### d10 Adventure Goal

- Determine why the Gruul have camped so close to l a settled neighborhood.
- 2 Free a captive taken in a recent raid.
- 3 Win freedom by defeating a Gruul champion in a duel.
- 4 Retrieve something looted in a recent raid.
- 5 Strike a deal with the Gruul leader to cooperate against a common foe.
- Attempt to overthrow the clan chieftain in a 6 combat challenge.
- 7 Strike a blow to the Gruul to ensure that they don't launch a raid.
- Free a corralled herd of violent beasts so they 8 stampede through the Gruul camp before the Gruul can steer them toward settled areas.
- 9 Interrupt a ritual intended to summon or create a huge elemental.
- Disrupt a gathering of clans that could lead to an 10 alliance between them.

#### RUBBLEBELT ENCAMPMENT MAP

Built in a plaza surrounded by crumbling ruins, this camp offers some defensive advantages to its Gruul residents. An old tower is the one intact structure the Gruul use, because it offers a good vantage point over the surrounding area. A sluiceway provides potable water, and a handful of scraggly trees are a reminder of nature's potential to grow and flourish even among the ruins.

Otherwise, the camp is little more than a handful of tents around a bonfire. A trash pit serves as a means of waste disposal, a few makeshift cages can hold prisoners, and a partially enclosed area to one side has been converted into a pen for the beasts used by the Gruul.

### GRUUL VILLAINS

The Gruul are straightforward villains, employing direct action and violence to tear down civilized society. They aren't schemers, and they have little patience for political maneuvering. Their cunning is that of a hunter stalking its prey, and the threat they pose is rampant, aggressive destruction. Examples of Gruul villains appear in the Gruul Villains table.

#### GRUUL VILLAINS

- 8 A druid leads a band that has begun starting fires around the district.

MAP 4.5: RUBBLEBELT ENCAMPMENT

#### GRUUL AS CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

Using the Gruul Clans as the main antagonists in a campaign could be an opportunity to explore the apocalyptic religious beliefs of the Old Ways-the expectation of the return of an ancient god, Ilharg the Raze-Boar.

At low levels, characters could be drawn into seemingly coincidental clashes with the Gruul, perhaps as minor events in adventures that involve other guilds. Only later does a pattern emerge: the raids correspond with certain astronomical events, the movements of wurms, or another sign that the druids of the Old Ways consider significant. As the adventurers' power grows, so does that of the Gruul druids behind the trouble, and soon the druids are actually instigating natural disasters-earthquakes and mighty storms, for example. As the campaign reaches its climax, the Gruul Clans all come together to perform an enormous ritual meant to summon the Raze-Boar and bring an end to civilization on Ravnica-and the adventurers must stop it.

#### GRUUL CHARACTER GOALS

The goals shown on the Gruul Assignments table can be objectives in themselves, or side quests that a Gruul character pursues in the course of undertaking an adventure with a larger purpose.

- 4 A wurm (see chapter 6 for the stat block) breaks free of its Gruul controller and goes on a rampage.
- Swine everywhere run wild, and the Gruul interpret 5 this as a sign of the Raze-Boar's return.
- 6 Gruul raiders steal something from an Izzet laboratory that will cause a disaster if it isn't returned.

# IZZET LEAGUE

Adventures involving the Izzet League typically concern magical mishaps, dangerous inventions, and feats of engineering (for good or ill). Player characters might be called upon to help clean up in the aftermath of a magical disaster, contain the damage, or rein in an ongoing danger. Or they could test or steal or destroy Izzet inventions, perhaps inadvertently causing magical catastrophes in the process.

#### EXPERIMENTAL WORKSHOP

The fundamental responsibility of the Izzet League is building and maintaining Ravnica's infrastructure, and the guild's work is responsible for many of the magicaltechnological conveniences that make life in the city relatively safe and comfortable, from paved roadways to running water. Under the leadership of the draconic genius Niv-Mizzet, the Izzet have continued to innovate, taking their work far beyond the essential needs of infrastructure and into the realm of wild invention. As a result, the workshops and laboratories of the Izzet are prone to magical mishaps, with results that range from personal injury to district-wide destruction. It is perhaps best for Ravnica as a whole that most of Izzet's work takes place in small workshops scattered throughout the city, rather than being concentrated in one place (with the guildhall of Nivix being the notable exception).

#### EXPERIMENTAL WORKSHOP ADVENTURES

Izzet workshops like the one depicted in map 4.6 are notable for three things: the brilliant minds at work

there, the incredible inventions they produce, and the destructive events that can occur when things go wrong. Adventurers might be drawn to a workshop to steal, thwart, or protect any of those things. The Experimental Workshop Adventures table shows some examples.

#### EXPERIMENTAL WORKSHOP ADVENTURES

#### d12 Adventure Goal

- ] Rescue people trapped in the workshop after a disaster.
- 2 Steal plans or a prototype for a new weapon.
- 3 Capture an inventor for interrogation.
- 4 Stop the spread of toxic gas or molten mizzium from inside the workshop.
- 5 Shut down the operation of a dangerous device.
- 6 Capture or kill an elemental or an Izzet weird (described in chapter 6) that is running amok in the workshop, and make sure it doesn't escape out into the city.
- 7 Get out of the workshop before it is destroyed by a spreading catastrophe.
- 00 Destroy the workshop in order to obliterate the research being done there.
- 9 Destroy the workshop in order to bring down a different building nearby.
- 10 Find a saboteur in the workshop before the traitor's plans can be enacted.
- 11 Kill an inventor whose ideas are too dangerous to be put into practice.
- 12 Activate an invention being held in storage in the workshop.

#### EXPERIMENTAL WORKSHOP MAP

An Izzet workshop is a chaotic place, buzzing with energy and activity. A mana generator in the basement fuels all the experimentation and construction above. The generator draws power from the city infrastructure, and ultimately from the Blistercoils, but the construction depicted in map 4.6 is designed to amplify and focus the magical energy. The machinery is fragile, so visitors are strongly discouraged from entering the basement.

Some parts of the generator extend up to the ground floor and the laboratory mezzanine above it, with portions of those floors open to the basement or covered only by metal grates. The ground level is typically cluttered with devices attached to the generator below, as well as cast-off pieces of such devices, awaiting new homes in new inventions. The laboratory mezzanine includes three spaces where projects can be developed in isolation, with thick walls providing some shielding from potentially explosive results. Additional equipment related to the generator system is housed in a tower and on the workshop's roof, culminating in a storm siphon that can harness and channel atmospheric energy (including lightning).

The Bizarre Magical Effects table provides suggestions for the sort of events that might result from a failed (or successful!) Izzet experiment, which can add spice to any Izzet adventure.

#### BIZARRE MAGICAL EFFECTS

#### de Effect

- l Every spell cast in the area triggers a wild magic surge. (Roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the "Sorcerer" section of the Player's Handbook.)
- 2 One or more objects in the area have a random trick effect. (Roll on the Tricks table in appendix A of the Dungeon Master's Guide.)

- 5 One or more objects in the area have a random trap effect. (Roll on the Traps table in appendix A of the Dungeon Master's Guide.)
- 6 Random sections of the area are affected by an antimagic field spell.

### IZZET VILLAINS

The behavior that members of the Izzet League display most often is careless disregard for safety, which causes frequent upheavals on both small and large scales. The true villains among the Izzet, though, aren't just accident-prone but also committed to widespread destruction. Out of madness or despair, they might plot the destruction of precincts or districts. Hungry for profit and power, they develop weapons capable of destroying large groups of people and commit crimes to get the resources they need to complete their research.

The Izzet Villains table includes examples of villains as well as those who have less sinister intentions.

#### IZZET VILLAINS

#### d8 Villain

- F A disgraced member of the Izmundi tries to embarrass the guild by orchestrating a magical disaster.

MAP 4.6: EXPERIMENTAL WORKSHOP

#### IZZET AS CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

A campaign involving the Izzet League could revolve around an Izzet researcher's efforts to gain personal power or greater influence for the guild through the wonders of modern magical science.

At low levels, the characters might help deal with a small-scale mishap in an Izzet workshop that is presumed to be an accident. Maybe something in the manner of the responsible researcher stirs up their suspicion, but there's no evidence of wrongdoing at this point. As the campaign progresses, the characters might continue having run-ins with the same researcher, whose work seems to be growing more dangerous. Eventually, they discover evidence that this researcher is developing weapons to use against the other guilds, and as a result the researcher has to move to a secret workshop, perhaps tucked away in the undercity. Or perhaps the guildmaster intervenes, declares this issue to be an internal matter for the Izzet to resolve, and assures the authorities that the researcher will be properly dealt with. As the campaign reaches its climax, the adventurers are tasked with discovering the researcher's secret laboratory and disabling the super-weapon.

#### IZZET CHARACTER GOALS

Characters who are connected with the Izzet League might be asked to run errands for higher-ranked researchers, or to take on more difficult tasks on behalf of colleagues. The Izzet Assignments table provides examples of goals that can serve as adventure hooks for a party or as side quests for an Izzet character to pursue in the course of a larger adventure.

#### IZZET ASSIGNMENTS

#### de Assignment

- l Acquire a hard-to-find metal or energy source.
- 2 Copy a rival's research notes.
- 3 Destroy a rival's research.

- 5 Test a new invention.
- 6 Repair an important piece of Ravnica's infrastructure, such as a water main or a boiler pipe, that is tucked away in a remote location.

### OTHER ADVENTURE HOOKS

The Izzet Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Izzet League.

#### IZZET ADVENTURE HOOKS

#### de Adventure Hook

- 4 After a laboratory explosion, an alchemical fire resistant to conventional firefighting techniques is spreading through several neighborhoods.
- 5 A reckless researcher triggered an explosion in a mizzium foundry, causing a wave of molten metal to spill out into the surrounding streets.
- 6 A researcher who claims to have traveled back in time warns of an impending disaster.

# ORZHOV SYNDICATE

The Orzhov Syndicate is a sprawling network of organized crime that operates behind a facade of legitimate banking, robed in the trappings of religion. Adventures involving the Orzhov often include some combination of fighting their criminal activities, interacting with their wealth, and dealing with the haunting spirits and sinister monsters that make up a significant part of the guild's leadership.

### GRAND BASILICA

Combining the guild's interests in organized crime, banking, and religion, Orzhov properties are ornate basilicas as grand as any cathedral, though the business conducted within them is driven by greed and lust for power rather than altruistic motives. Each location includes a grand space used not for purposes of worship, but to ensure that petitioners feel small and abased before the Orzhov oligarchs. Its lower level contains vaults to store the ill-gotten riches of its leaders, as well as crypts that hold the corpses of family members whose spirits might still be active above.

#### GRAND BASILICA ADVENTURES

An adventure in an Orzhov basilica, like the one shown in map 4.7, can feel like the action in a gangster movie, a bank heist, or the exploration of a haunted house. The Grand Basilica Adventures table provides some examples.

#### GRAND BASILICA ADVENTURES

|
|  |

- Steal (or recover) a magic item from the vaults ] below the basilica.
- Put an end to nightly visitations by finding and 2 confronting the haunting spirit in the basilica.
- 3 Survive a night trapped inside the basilica.
- Deliver a warning to an Orzhov pontiff in the 4 basilica and get out alive.
- 5 Rescue a prisoner being held in the basilica's spire or crypts.
- Escape from captivity in the basilica's spire or 6 crypts.
- 7 Destroy a dangerous weapon stored in a vault beneath the basilica.
- Acquire or destroy some incriminating evidence 8 held by an Orzhov blackmailer.
- Retrieve a precious item held as collateral by an 9 Orzhov loan shark.
- Get information from a spirit who knew something 10 important in life.
- 11 Find concrete evidence of the syndicate's illegal activities.
- Discover the fate of someone who was last seen 12 entering the basilica a week ago.

#### ORZHOV BASILICA MAP

The Orzhov basilica is a huge church with the primary function of intimidating those who come to confess, atone, borrow, or pay. The nave features lofty archways, towering statues of proud oligarchs, and a huge central statue that depicts the Ghost Council surrounded by supplicants. A pair of tall doors behind the statue leads to an sanctuary where minor treasures-worth more than most citizens will ever see in their lives, but less than the true treasures hidden in the vaults-are put on display to encourage devotion. Another statue of a patron oligarch (usually the basilica's founder) stands at the end of this room, flanked by spiral staircases leading up into the spire and down to the crypts. The stairs are secured behind ornate wrought iron gates.

The three levels of the spire hold luxurious apartments where living oligarchs dwell. The doors can be locked from the outside, making them also suitable for holding valuable prisoners.

The crypts and vaults below the basilica hold the bones of ancient oligarchs and their most cherished treasures. Some crypts contain just bones, others just valuables, and some hold both. A security station keeps watch on the entire level, and the guards there are typically the only ones who have keys to open the metal portcullises that obstruct the hallway.

#### ORZHOV VILLAINS

Examples of Orzhov villains appear in the Orzhov Villains table.

#### ORZHOV VILLAINS

| 48 | Villain |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A powerful pontiff is using the spirits of dead |
|  | relatives to intimidate members of other guilds. |

| 3 | An Orzhov knight is trying to collect an overdue |
|  | debt incurred by one of the adventurers' ancestors. |
| 4 | A pontiff is running an extortion racket, promising |
|  | local businesses protection from thugs that are |

| 8 | An unusually quick-witted Orzhov giant (see |
|  | chapter 6 for the stat block) with grand visions of |
|  | starting a criminal gang interferes with the flow of |
|  | protection money. |

#### ORZHOV AS CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

Orzhov villains often scheme to achieve immortality (if they are still alive and have been denied the prospect of becoming a spirit after death), to gain influence, and

MAP 4.7: GRAND BASILICA

especially to gather wealth (because too much is never enough). Their favorite methods include coercion, confidence scams (mostly relying on the fine print in magically binding contracts), murder, politics, theft, torture, and vice.

You could build a campaign around the Orzhov Syndicate's efforts to gain control of the adventurers. Recognizing the characters as powerful agents for change, one or more pontiffs scheme to make sure that the syndicate can direct that force toward goals of their choosing. In typical Orzhov fashion, that generally means trying to force the characters into debt, either to the Orzhov in general or to an individual pontiff.

At low levels, the Orzhov might be nothing more than a gentle force behind the scenes. If the adventurers need help, an Orzhov agent might appear and offer it. If they commit crimes, the Orzhov find out about it. The characters' valuables can be kept safe in an Orzhov vault, and Orzhov ministrants can provide healing and other clerical magic at reasonable prices.

As the campaign progresses and the characters acquire more influence in their guilds and in the city at large, the Orzhov begin trying to exert pressure. They call in favors in exchange for the help they have previously offered, they make subtle threats about reporting the adventurers' illegal acts, or they point to the fine print in agreements made with the ministrants. Initially, their motives might not be outwardly sinister. (The Orzhov Assignments table can serve as inspiration.) But if

LOGOS, DAVID PALUI

the characters work against Orzhov interests, the syndicate interferes more forcefully. All the while, Orzhov leaders are looking for ways to trap the characters under their ghostly thumbs.

As the campaign builds to a climax, the adventurers might be forced to make sacrifices in order to throw off the yoke of Orzhov debt. That turn of events could lead to a confrontation with an undead pontiff or even the entire Obzedat. And if a member of the adventuring party has died along the way, the other characters might find themselves fighting the spirit of their dead companion!

### ORZHOV CHARACTER GOALS

Characters who are members of the Orzhov Syndicate, as well as those who are indebted to the Orzhov, might receive missions or errands that further the interests of their corrupt overlords. The Orzhov Assignments table includes examples of quests and side quests that such characters might undertake.

#### ORZHOV ASSIGNMENTS

#### de Assignment

- l Convince a debtor to make a payment.
- Damage the person or property of someone who 2 refuses to pay protection money.
- 3 Distribute alms-coins to the poor.
- 4 Transport a chest of coins to an Orzhov bank.
- Destroy evidence that implicates the Orzhov in a 5 crime.
- 6 Find information that can be used to blackmail a powerful person.

#### OTHER ADVENTURE HOOKS

The Orzhov Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Orzhov Syndicate.

#### ORZHOV ADVENTURE HOOKS

#### de Adventure Hook

- Newly minted Orzhov coins are inscribed with a 1 magical symbol that binds the spirit of anyone who uses them.
- Indentured spirits (see chapter 6 for the stat block) 2 have been deployed to haunt a location the Orzhov want to keep people away from.
- 3 Thrulls (described in chapter 6) that have broken free of Orzhov control are causing mischief.
- 4 Items appear on the black market that were obviously stolen from an Orzhov vault, but no one admits that the theft has occurred or claims credit.
- Gargoyles perched on structures throughout the 5 city are robbing passersby and delivering their stolen goods to an Orzhov basilica.
- An eclipse triggers violent behavior from bound 6 Orzhov spirits.

# CULT OF RAKDOS

On most worlds, a cult dedicated to an ancient demon lord would be an obvious villain. to be rooted out and exterminated at all costs. On Ravnica, though, the status of the Cult of Rakdos isn't so clear-cut. It is a guild like the others, and its existence is mandated by the Guildpact, so exterminating it and its founder would violate the fundamental social order of the world. Although the ranks of Rakdos include outright villains who crave blood and mayhem, most of its members are performers who just want to put on a good show. Not every performance ends in violence, and even when a riot does break out, it's not always easy to pin the blame on the entertainers.

Nonetheless, the Cult of Rakdos has more than its share of truly villainous members, and the guild provides ample opportunity for adventurers to fight against true evil.

### NOTORIOUS NIGHTCLUB

Catering to all sorts of demented desires, nightclubs like the one shown in map 4.8 are permanent venues, in contrast to the portable tents and stages set up by Rakdos performers in streets and plazas every night. Much of what happens here would be illegal if it weren't consensual-and if the city's rich and powerful weren't as drawn to its forbidden pleasures as anyone else in Ravnica.

#### NOTORIOUS NIGHTCLUB ADVENTURES

Characters might be drawn to a Rakdos nightclub for reasons that have nothing to do with adventuring. but adventures unfold in these places regardless. The Notorious Nightclub Adventures table includes a variety of examples.

#### NOTORIOUS NIGHTCLUB ADVENTURES

#### d12 Adventure Goal

- Shut down a performance before the performers l start attacking the crowd.
- 2 Escape from the club once the violence starts.
- 3 Protect a thrill seeker who wants to witness a performance close up.
- 4 Rescue someone who has been abducted for use as an extra in a show.
- 5 Find evidence that someone important was (or was not) killed in a previous performance here.
- 6 Capture a performer who ran away from a prominent family to "join the circus."
- 7 Use the distraction of a performance to hold a secret meeting with someone from another guild.
- 8 Spy on someone who is using the distraction of a performance to hold a secret meeting.
- 9 Acquire a magic item the Rakdos are using as part of a performance.
- 10 Investigate rumors that the Rakdos have a wingless angel in their show.
- 11 Find an escaped convict who is rumored to be hiding behind Rakdos makeup.
- 12 Stop a Rakdos member who is blackmailing an important person with embarrassing information.

#### NOTORIOUS NIGHTCLUB MAP

Security, privacy, and terror are the priorities of this nightclub. Visitors are channeled through a large entry vestibule into an upper area with tables tucked away in nooks. From there, they can watch the violent antics of ferocious beasts or performers in cages suspended from the ceiling. Stairs lead down to the area of the main stage, where headlining performances are held. Offices and storage areas fill the rest of the main level.

A second stage in the lower level provides a more upclose experience, which often means audience members are showered in blood or drawn into the show. Several private booths surround the backstage area, with doors that include shuttered windows to enable those inside to keep an eye on the show or carry out private business.

### RAKDOS VILLAINS

Rakdos villains range in power from demented cultists to sadistic demons. Most of them are driven by a desire for unfettered mayhem. A hunger for a certain form of immortality (being an artist who is remembered forever) often feeds that desire, and insofar as Rakdos can be considered the "god" of his cult, objectives related to magic-carrying out his wishes, offering him sacrifices, and rousing him into action-are also significant objectives for some cultists. Driven as they are by selfish impulse and emotion, Rakdos villains also sometimes pursue schemes related to passion, power, or revenge. Specific examples appear on the Rakdos Villains table.

#### RAKDOS VILLAINS

#### d8 Villain

- A coven of blood witches (see chapter 6 for the stat l block), seeking Rakdos's favor, uses magic to turn members of other guilds against their own allies.
- 2 Word spreads that a retiring performer wants to go out with a bang, and their final performance promises to be explosive.
- 3 Mocking the absence of the Guildpact, a Rakdos troupe takes over the Chamber of the Guildpact and performs its satire before a captive audience.
- A demon captures people and makes a game of 4 thwarting their efforts to escape.

#### d8 Villain

- 5 A skilled puppeteer uses skeletal marionettes to recreate historical acts of violence between guilds-which are inexplicably repeated in the real world within the next few days.
- 6 A ringmaster has discovered magic that fills the whole audience with blood lust and sends them rampaging through the streets.
- 7 A hypnotist is programming audience members to go into a murderous rage when a triggering event occurs.
- 8 A crazed blood witch (see chapter 6 for the stat block) hopes to rouse Rakdos by driving captured sacrificial victims into his lair.

#### RAKDOS AS CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

You could build a campaign around the Cult of Rakdos's efforts to stir its demonic patron into action against the other guilds. The campaign might unfold amid steadily increasing violence, escalating to episodes of widespread rioting and rampaging demons.

At lower levels, the adventurers might encounter incidental violence spilling over from Rakdos venues: a brawl outside a nightclub, overenthusiastic devils spreading fires around a street stage, or the "accidental" death of a few performers at the climax of their act. As the campaign progresses, the characters might be drawn into combating the efforts of blood witches who are trying to exterminate the cult's most active enemies. The more they foil the cult's efforts, the more the characters themselves become targets of both ridicule and violent action.

At the campaign's climax, the adventurers might have to interrupt a ritual performed in Rakdos's lair in order to prevent him from rampaging through the city-or if they are too late to do that, they might have to fight the ancient demon lord himself.

### RAKDOS CHARACTER GOALS

Characters who are members of the Cult of Rakdos are expected to be self-motivated and rarely take orders from anyone other than Rakdos himself. The Rakdos Assignments table includes some suggestions for adventures or side quests that Rakdos characters might undertake on their own initiative, or perhaps at the request of a ringmaster or a fellow performer.

#### RAKDOS ASSIGNMENTS

#### de Assignment

- l Acquire a flashy magic item to use as a prop in a performance.
- 2 Try out a new performance routine in the midst of actual life-or-death combat.
- 3 Sow distrust of an important person through satire or slander.
- 4 Make sure a specific person is in the front row for a certain performance.
- 5 Capture a deadly monster for use in a spectacular show.
- 6 Interrupt a solemn ceremony or ritual being performed by another guild.

### OTHER ADVENTURE HOOKS

The Rakdos Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Cult of Rakdos.

#### RAKDOS ADVENTURE HOOKS

#### de Adventure Hook

- Wild-eyed people attending a popular new club T seem unwilling or unable to go home after several days of nonstop merriment.
- 2 One morning, everyone who has seen a Rakdos performance in the past week suddenly transforms into a minor demon.
- 3 An apparently spontaneous Rakdos-led riot has spread to take over an entire neighborhood.
- 4 People who die in Rakdos-inspired violence stand back up as zombies and keep fighting.
- 5 Ordinary knives and chains in homes across the neighborhood seem to come to life in advance of the start of a Rakdos show.
- 6 After several mausoleums are burst open from the inside, people see their undead family members cavorting on a Rakdos stage.

# SELESNYA CONCLAVE

The Selesnya Conclave is most likely to be involved in adventures as a force for good, since many of its members are healers, diplomats, and mediators. It is a natural home for player characters-especially clerics and druids-so it might serve as a patron. Nonetheless, the guild has a militaristic bent, and like nature itself it isn't beyond corruption.

#### VERNADI CENTER

The basic unit of the Conclave's organization is the vernadi-a community centered on a large tree and led by the voda of the enclave, a dryad whose spirit is linked to that tree. From the outside, a vernadi might resemble a peaceful commune, and thus seem to be an easy target for theft or assault. But its temple gardens are protected by soldiers and archers, and even the seemingly serene initiates have some military training.

#### VERNADI CENTER ADVENTURES

Though a vernadi lacks the defensive fortifications of, for example, a Boros garrison, it is still a difficult place to attack or infiltrate. Because of the sheer numbers of initiates that might be inside, stealth is probably a better tactic than frontal assault. The Vernadi Center Adventures table offers some suggestions.

#### VERNADI CENTER ADVENTURES

#### d12 Adventure Goal

l

- Ascertain the numbers of the military forces housed in and around the vernadi.
- Find the source of pollen that is drifting through 2 the neighborhood and making people placid and compliant.
- 3 Find the source of wind-borne seeds that are drifting through the neighborhood and quickly growing into hostile awakened shrubs.
- 4 Retrieve an initiate who was supposedly forced to join the guild through mind-affecting magic.
- 5 Stop the vernadi, whose tree has awakened and escaped the control of its dryad, from trampling through the neighborhood.
- 6 Find a way to tap into the mind, will, and knowledge of Mat'Selesnya through the vernadi's central tree or its dryad.
- 7 Introduce a contagion into Mat'Selesnya through the vernadi's tree or its dryad.
- 8 Capture an equenaut who has been accused of a crime and who has taken refuge at the vernadi.
- 9 Convince or coerce a healer to tend to a sick or wounded person who would normally be an enemy of the conclave.
- 10 Find a spy embedded in the vernadi community.
- 11 Blend into the community to avoid pursuers.
- Retrieve an item that was donated to the commu-12 nity by a new initiate, but without the permission of the item's owner.

Bol

#### VERNADI CENTER MAP

The temple shown in map 4.9 is at the heart of the vernadi, built in and around a large tree. A circle of white marble with several archways surrounds the base of the tree, encompassing both a decorative garden where meetings are held and a vegetable garden that provides food for the vernadi. The meeting garden includes benches and a fountain of fresh water. Two small buildings at ground level offer rustic accommodations for members of the vernadi or guests.

Gracefully curving ramps sweep around the trunk of the tree, leading to various other small buildings. Several of these are open to the air, offering sheltered places for gatherings or quiet contemplation. Others are apartments where leaders of the vernadi live. Near the top of the tree is a large, round temple space.

### SELESNYA VILLAINS

True evil is rare among the members of Selesnya, with misplaced religious zeal being the impetus that most commonly pushes its members into acts of villainy.

Examples of Selesnya villains appear in the Selesnya Villains table.

#### SELESNYA VILLAINS

#### 98 Villain

l

- A fanatical leader disrupts building projects because they aren't in harmony with nature.
- 2 A Ledev guardian is leading preemptive raids on other guilds, believing that a full-scale attack on the conclave is imminent.
- 3 A voda, feeling imperiled by the ills of society, causes vines to grow and seal the members of her vernadi inside.
- 4 A militant leader of a splinter group harasses "unbelievers" on the street and threatens to unleash elemental power on them.
- 5 A loxodon evangel uses coercive methods to recruit young people into the conclave.
- 6 An elf seeking spiritual union with Mat'Selesnya threatens the dryad of their own vernadi.
- 7 A crazed prophet claims to be the incarnation of Mat'Selesnya and gathers an army to strike at other guilds.
- 8 A horncaller (see chapter 6 for the stat block) steals animals that were used as pets, mounts, and beasts of burden throughout the neighborhood.

#### SELESNYA AS CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

You could structure a campaign around the efforts of the Selesnya Conclave to finally bring all of Ravnica into its welcoming embrace.

At lower levels, Selesnya might be an ally to the player characters, offering support in the form of healing and other magic. By the time the characters reach middle levels, Selesnya emerges as a threat: perhaps it becomes clear that several vernadi are using magical charms (or other forms of coercion) to win converts, and the conclave might even try to coerce the player characters to join. Eventually, their strategy evolves toward extortion and conquest, as they unleash wurms and similar powerful beasts to threaten those who refuse to convert, and they use the might of their armies to eliminate other guilds and bring whole precincts under their control. The climax of the campaign might involve the heroes leading or coordinating the efforts of all nine other guilds to unite against the Selesnya threat.

### SELESNYA CHARACTER GOALS

Characters who are part of the Selesnya Conclave are usually sent into the world to help ease suffering, make peace, win converts, and advance the other objectives of the guild. The Selesnya Assignments table includes a number of side quests for individual Selesnya characters as well as adventure hooks for a whole party.

#### SELESNYA ASSIGNMENTS

- de Assignment
- l Work to stop the spread of a strange illness.
- 2 Tend to the victims of a catastrophe or an attack.
- 3 Mediate a dispute between two other guilds.
- Plant a magic seed, watch it grow into a great tree, 4 and defend the tree until reinforcements arrive.
- 5 Bring an unruly beast under control and return it to the vernadi it escaped from.
- 6 Lead a targeted military strike to warn another guild against overreaching.

#### OTHER ADVENTURE HOOKS

The Selesnya Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the conclave.

#### SELESNYA ADVENTURE HOOKS

- de Adventure Hook
- A sacred tree has been defiled or cut down, and an 1 angry Selesnya mob is gathering to exact revenge.
- 2 The Worldsoul has identified the characters as emblematic of their guilds' overreaching ambition.
- 3 A seer of the conclave tries to convince the characters that they are fated to save the world.
- Plants throughout a neighborhood develop 4 carnivorous tendencies.
- 5 A magic-infused stone of a Selesnya building grows out of control, threatening nearby buildings.
- A Selesnya wurm (see chapter 6 for the stat block) 6 breaks free of its controller and goes on a rampage.

# SIMIC COMBINE

Adventures that involve the Simic Combine delve into the world of weird magical science. The Simic breed the hybrids known as krasis, and those creations can break free of their controllers and rampage through the city streets. The Simic also infuse sapient races with animal features, creating hybrids with adaptations designed for combat and espionage.

### GROWTH CHAMBER

Although most Simic research is concentrated in the nine zonots distributed all over Ravnica, mages affiliated with the guild construct laboratories in various other locations, particularly when they are seeking a particular combination of environmental factors such as air and water temperature, humidity, and ambient light. Growth chambers like the one depicted in map 4.10, built for the creation and incubation of krasis and hybrids, could be located anywhere, from deep in the undercity to the top of a tall spire.

#### GROWTH CHAMBER ADVENTURES

Adventures in a growth chamber often involve dealing with Simic experiments. The Growth Chamber Adventures table shows some examples.

#### GROWTH CHAMBER ADVENTURES

| d12 | Adventure Goal |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Escape from the chamber while a category 3 kra- |

#### GROWTH CHAMBER MAP

This structure is attached to the side of some other structure, much as a coral affixes itself to a solid surface. It might be built on the inside wall of a zonot or a chasm, or it could abut another building at street level. The chamber consists of a series of overlapping domes with large, green-tinted windows.

The main entrance leads into a lobby with three decorative pools and three functional growth pods showcasing the most innocuous research being done here. The pods are glass and metal devices filled with greenish, vaguely glowing liquid, designed to allow life forms to gestate and grow until they are ready to emerge. The pods might be growing homunculi or category 1 krasis, but it would be highly unusual for the Simic to display the maturation of a hybrid soldier in such a public way. Four smaller growth pods to one side serve the same function. On the other side, a meeting room (containing one more growth pod) offers a place for researchers to meet with outsiders.

The first level above the main floor is dedicated to living, cooking, and eating space for the researchers and others who live here. A single large room acts as a barracks for the scientists, with folding screens offering some degree of privacy.

The other levels of the chamber are entirely dedicated to research and space to grow the laboratory's creations. Growth pods are found in nearly every room.

### SIMIC VILLAINS

Examples of Simic villains appear in the Simic Villains table.

#### SIMIC VILLAINS

#### d8 Villain

- A rogue researcher is flooding parts of the under-] city to serve as aquariums for secret experiments.
- 2 Researchers are capturing members of the other guilds so they can create hybrid soldiers that take advantage of the weaknesses of those guilds.
- 3 Researchers team up to surround an entire neighborhood in a plasma casing that is slowly altering the environment and all its inhabitants.
- 4 A magic-wielding Simic hybrid is eluding capture by the authorities thanks to a combination of adaptations and spells.
- 5 A researcher delves too deep into ancient lore and discovers mind-warping alien secrets.
- 6 A researcher creates a moss that threatens to destroy much of the city's food production.
- 7 A biomancer (see chapter 6 for the stat block) seeks revenge by creating a specialized krasis that targets a specific guild.

A researcher turns to necromancy, exploring the 8 combination of dead body parts with living tissue.

#### SIMIC AS CAMPAIGN VILLAINS

Many Simic researchers are driven by the belief that the guild must adapt to the prospect of imminent war among the guilds. Thus, villains among their number are often those who seek to provoke the war they have foreseen, or those who go to extraordinary, unethical, or illegal lengths to conduct their work.

In the early stages of the campaign, the adventurers might face Simic-related threats such as rogue hybrids and rampaging krasis, which seem to be unrelated to each other and more or less accidental. As the campaign progresses, it becomes clear that these Simic creatures are part of a military build-up. The wrath of the other guilds turns toward the combine, but this conflict is exactly what the guild has been preparing for. Ultimately, it falls to the characters to either prevent the war, disable the Simic creatures that are poised to obliterate the other guilds' armies, or find another course of action that can maintain the balance of power in Ravnica.

#### SIMIC CHARACTER GOALS

The Simic Assignments table presents some ideas for missions that could drive an adventure or serve as side quests for a Simic character.

#### SIMIC ASSIGNMENTS

#### de Assignment

- 1 Protect a Simic researcher who is trying to make an exhaustive examination of a new form of plant life.
- 2 Capture a previously unknown type of creature.
- 3 Contain an ooze or a krasis that is running loose.
- Observe the behavior of a new form of krasis or 4 Simic hybrid in the field.

#### de Assignment

- 5 Test a symbiotic magic item or life form (perhaps something like a living cloak of the manta ray).
- Introduce a new predator species to the area to 6 prey on a smaller species that is running amok.

#### OTHER ADVENTURE HOOKS

The Simic Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Simic Combine.

#### SIMIC ADVENTURE HOOKS

#### de Adventure Hook

# KRENKO'S WAY

"Krenko's Way" is a short adventure for a party of four to six 1st-level adventurers, who might advance to 2nd level by the adventure's conclusion. It is set in the Tenth District of Ravnica and serves as an introductory adventure to the setting. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges. Adventurers can be affiliated with any of the guilds.

# STORY OVERVIEW

Krenko is the boss of a notorious goblin mob, and he has made his fortune and built his reputation by mostly staying out of the guilds' way. He has managed to cause no end of trouble for the citizens of the Tenth District,

#### GUILDLESS VILLAINS

Not every villain in a Ravnica campaign is a member of a guild, and not every scheme originates in the guildhalls. As you build your own adventures in Ravnica, you can use the suggestions in the Dungeon Master's Guide for creating villains to craft a guildless villain, one who prefers the independence of operating outside the guild structure or even seeks to undermine that structure entirely. More often than not, though, the guilds turn out to be involved in the schemes of even minor villains.

but not without attracting the attention of the guilds. A cunning opportunist, Krenko has spent years consolidating goblin street rabble into his fiercely loyal gang. He cultivated connections among the ruthless and powerful, specializing in high-value theft and mayhem. At the apex of his influence, he got into a nasty turf war with the Shattergang Brothers, a rival goblin gang that often deals in illicit arms. Rumors swirled that Krenko killed Dargig, the youngest of the three brothers, after a weapons drop went bad.

The remaining two brothers, Rikkig and Gardagig, attempted to kill Krenko in retaliation for the death of their kin. Before they could do the deed, Krenko was apprehended by the Boros Legion and thrown into Sawtooth Prison-near the legion's headquarters of Sunhome-to spend the rest of his life behind bars. But someone as well connected as Krenko has ways of shortening his own sentence.

Inciting a riot in prison secured him a transfer to Udzec, a maximum-security facility in Precinct Two of the Tenth District, administered by the Azorius Senate. During the transfer, agents of a former associate of Krenko's created a distraction, and he was able to slip away to rendezvous with his gang. He now plots his next move as he reestablishes power over his criminal enterprise.

Krenko's escape is no small matter. The Chamber of the Guildpact gets involved, alarmed at the possibility of another goblin gang war that could threaten the tenuous peace between the guilds. During the adventure, the Shattergang Brothers catch wind of Krenko's freedom, and are desperate to make him pay.

### RUNNING THE ADVENTURE

This adventure requires the fifth edition D&D rulebooks (Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual). You should read the entire adventure before attempting to run it. If you'd prefer to play, you. shouldn't read any farther.

Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.

The Monster Manual contains statistics for many of the creatures found in this adventure. When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. If the stat block appears elsewhere, the adventure's text tells you so.

#### ADVENTURE SUMMARY

The adventure begins at Sawtooth Prison as the party is summoned by Nassius Ven, an official from the Chamber of the Guildpact. He explains that Krenko has escaped during a prison transfer, and it's urgent that the characters locate him and bring him back to justice as soon as possible and with discretion.

The characters can retrace the route of the transfer, interview the guards for more information, and use their contacts in the city to find out more about Krenko. If they are indiscreet in their investigation, they could attract the attention of the Shattergang Brothers, a rival gang intent on murdering Krenko. Members of that gang will trail the party throughout the city in an attempt to find the goblin mob boss's location.

Eventually, the adventurers find Krenko's hideout: a warehouse near a canal. A final showdown with the goblin mob boss, his retinue, and possible Shattergang interlopers ensues. Then it's merely a matter of delivering Krenko back to Nassius before more trouble breaks out.

### KRENKO'S PATRON

Krenko arranged a deal with a faction while in prison. During his transfer, members of that faction struck down his escort and freed him.

At the beginning of the adventure, you can roll a patron from the table below, or you can

choose one (preferably a guild that isn't represented by an adventurer in the party). The patron affects the story of Krenko's escape in a specific way (as indicated following the table) and, if you so choose, might influence future adventures.

#### KRENKO'S PATRON

#### de Guild

- Dimir. An impenetrable fog appeared, confusing the 1 escort and obscuring their view. Krenko slipped his restraints and scurried off in the mist.
- 2 Golgari. A swarm of centipedes burst out of a nearby sewer and overwhelmed the guards, knocking them unconscious with venomous bites. When the guards were revived, Krenko was gone.
- 3 Gruul. A Gruul warband screamed through the streets, smashing anything that got in the way. The guards clashed with the Gruul; during the fight, one of them broke Krenko's bonds and the goblin fled the scene.
- Izzet. A pair of armored mages descended from the 4 sky on hovering discs. They aimed devices attached to their arms at the guards and blasted them back with a concussive wave. While the guards were recovering, the mages magically dissolved Krenko's bonds and he escaped.
- 5 Rakdos. A troupe of performers crossed paths with the guards, who became transfixed by a fiery acrobatic street display. When the performance was over, Krenko had gone missing.
- Simic. A skyswimmer intercepted and attacked e Krenko's escort. It unleashed a powerful discharge of lightning, which knocked out all the guards. When they woke up, Krenko had disappeared.

### STARTING THE ADVENTURE

Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following introductory text:

Life in the Tenth District is never dull. A hub of constant activity, it always offers a new opportunity, a new challenge, a new intrigue. It is a place where a promising adventurer like you can find your path to glory, riches, or power through your allegiance to your guild. But first you'll need a job that will help you prove your worth.

Today is your lucky day. This afternoon, you received a brief note from one of your contacts: "I heard today from someone who is looking for help finding something. Seems serious. Might be a good opportunity for you. Meet outside Sawtooth Prison at dusk."

At the appointed time, you find yourself gathered with other like-minded individuals outside the front door to the functional and unremarkable Sawtooth Prison.

Have the players introduce their characters to each other, if they aren't acquainted already. This might also be a time for the characters to identify or discover personal connections that might link them, such as common acquaintances or contacts, a shared background, or living in the same neighborhood. Once the characters have had a chance to get to know one another, read:

Light rain begins to patter on the cobblestones as the sun sets behind the spires and towers of the city. You see a male vedalken in well-tailored clothes approach your group from around the side of the prison. His deep blue face bears a gentle but concerned expression. He raises his hand to hail you and speaks in a low tone as his eyes take in your group and the nearby environs. "Are you here to help us find something?"

This is Nassius Ven, a vedalken noble and a proctor from the office of the Guildpact. While the Azorius and Boros help maintain the law and keep the peace, the office of the Guildpact tries to helps quell disputes between the guilds while the Living Guildpact is away. Nassius is here to hire the characters to track down Krenko because he suspects the involvement of one or more guilds in the goblin boss's escape but doesn't know who is involved.

### ROLEPLAYING NASSIUS VEN

After receiving affirmative answers from the party, Nassius hands the characters a dossier from Sawtooth Prison with an image of a smug, tough-looking male goblin on it. Nassius offers up the following information, which can be conveyed through conversation with him:

- - "We have need of your particular skills to assist in the retrieval of a convict who got loose just before sunrise this morning. He escaped during his transfer to Udzec, a maximum-security prison where he would have spent the rest of his days."
	- "His name is Krenko. He's the boss of a large gang of goblins that operates around Foundry Street. He was apprehended to answer for a long list of crimes, including murder. He allegedly incited a riot that led to the deaths of a guard and two inmates at this prison a week ago. The warden decided enough was enough and put through his transfer."
	- "Krenko has made a lot of enemies, but the Shattergang Brothers are his biggest threat. They're a rival goblin gang specializing in illicit weapons, and they want Krenko dead in reprisal for the murder of one of their lieutenants. The dead lieutenant also happens to be the youngest of the three siblings that run the gang. They'll tear apart the neighborhood to find him once they know he has escaped."
	- "Normally, we'd let the Azorius deal with this situation, but we suspect that Krenko might have had help from one of the other guilds when he escaped. We are enlisting others to investigate that connection, as it could point to a bigger problem."
	- "We need you to track down Krenko and bring him back alive. Then we can interrogate him and keep him off the streets for good."
	- · "I am prepared to give you ten zinos right now to cover any expenses you might incur during your investigation. Upon delivery of the criminal, you'll receive one hundred zinos and my gratitude, which I will convey to your guild leaders. Under no circumstances should you attempt to question Krenko yourselves."

If he is asked, Nassius provides the guards' account of the circumstances of his escape (see "Krenko's Patron"). The guards have already been thoroughly questioned, and Krenko's trail has gone cold. Nassius is eager to get the characters started as soon as possible to prevent the Shattergang Brothers from learning of Krenko's escape.

Nassius asks the party to bring Krenko to an old Selesnya granary that was damaged in a Gruul raid at the edge of the district. There, he'll take Krenko into custody.

Nassius is evasive about any questions regarding why Krenko shouldn't be interrogated or why the characters should bring him to the granary. His eyes dart back and forth when confronted with these sorts of questions. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check knows that Nassius isn't being completely forthright. Even if pressed, Nassius doesn't offer up any other information beyond the mission objectives.

# THE SEARCH FOR KRENKO

Once Nassius has departed, the characters can get to work. They can conduct their investigation however they choose, but time is of the essence since eventually word on the street gets back to the Shattergang Brothers and they start another turf war to flush Krenko out.

#### TIMELINE OF EVENTS

Here's a timeline of what has happened since Krenko escaped and what happens in the future, absent interference. As soon as the adventurers get involved, events might change drastically, but the following timeline can still help you determine how the various NPCs involved in the story will react to the player characters' actions.

#### Early Morning, Day 1: Krenko escapes.

- Late Morning, Day 1: Krenko meets with his gang and prepares a disguise for himself.
- Noon, Day 1: Krenko and his gang secure an abandoned warehouse as a temporary hideout for the mob boss.
- Sunset, Day 1: The adventurers receive the mission.
- Late Evening, Day 1: Krenko places a weapons order with Falish, a human arms dealer.
- Noon, Day 2: Additional enforcers from Krenko's gang arrive at Krenko's hideout.
- Sunset, Day 2: The Shattergang Brothers hear about Krenko's escape and mobilize to find him. Falish leaves a cache of weapons at a drop point on Foundry Street, and a goblin carries the weapons back to Krenko's hideout.
- Late Evening, Day 2: Explosions rock Foundry Street as the Shattergang Brothers start violently coercing citizens who are known to have dealings with Krenko. The Lyev Column (Azorius law enforcement) is dispatched to Foundry Street to investigate the disturbance.
- Predawn, Day 3: The Shattergang Brothers find out Krenko's location, and a great explosion goes off there, leveling the building and killing many goblins (Krenko survives).
- Noon, Day 3: The Foundry Street vicinity is subject to terrible goblin gang violence. The Boros Legion is called in to pacify the area.

#### THE DOSSIER

The adventurers can find the following information in the Sawtooth Prison dossier:

- · Krenko has been a goblin mob boss for several years. His turf was around Foundry Street. He has been a person of interest in numerous crimes befitting a mobster but managed to evade the law-until recently.
- · Krenko was brought into custody by Gideon Jura, a freelancer working with the Boros Legion at the time. Krenko was found guilty of murdering Dargig, one of the Shattergang Brothers, and of assault with a deadly weapon against Gideon Jura.
- The weapon on his person at the time of arrest was a magic shiv (a prison knife). Reportedly, it could punch through force barriers. It isn't known how Krenko obtained the weapon.
- · Krenko's notable associates include the mysterious Mr. Taz (no other information provided) and a renegade Izzet weapons inventor named Falish (female human, seen around Tin Street). Both are also persons of interest to the Azorius.

#### HITTING THE STREETS

The characters can take several approaches to investigating Krenko's whereabouts: meeting with contacts, sussing out rumors, or visiting important locations.

#### MEET WITH CONTACTS

If a character has an appropriate contact to press for information, they can reach out to that contact for assistance. It takes 1 hour to arrange a meeting with the contact and 1d6 hours for the contact to find one previously unknown piece of information, unless that contact would have the information on hand.

#### GATHER RUMORS

Characters can go to public gathering places to attempt to obtain information. After 1d6 hours, a character sifting through rumors makes a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, they find out one previously unknown piece of information from among those given below:

- · Krenko's absence has hurt his gang's reputation. Other gangs have been encroaching on his territory, and it's only a matter of time before there's another power struggle played out in the streets.
- · Tin Street is a bustling center of trade and the territory of the Shattergang Brothers. They have become emboldened since Krenko was put away and are readying for war to take out his gang once and for all.
- · Foundry Street is where you'll find manufacturing facilities for the Tenth District, and it's Krenko's gang's turf. His enforcers are still squabbling over who should lead. For now, they all have an uneasy truce with each other.
- · Some goblins were pulling up a sewer grate at a very early hour west of the plaza. They didn't look like maintenance workers and threatened anyone that came too close. The approximate location of this incident is obtained.

Three locations important to the adventure are mentioned in the information above: the sewers, Foundry Street, and Tin Street. Each site is described in detail below. The travel time (on foot) between any two of these locations is 30 minutes to 1 hour.

### THE SEWERS AT PLAZA WEST

Characters heading west of the plaza on a tip they received earlier might look for a sewer grate that is out of place. It takes 1 hour and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to find a grate with scrapes from a crowbar on it. Alternatively, the characters can interview residents in the area, in which case it takes half an hour and a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to find the location of the grate.

The grate can be pulled up with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Once the grate is opened, read:

A circular maintenance shaft plunges down into the darkness. An iron ladder is bolted to one side of the shaft. The pungent smell of the sewers wafts up to your nose. A faint light is visible at the bottom, illuminating refuse-filled water.

There is no light source in the shaft, which continues down 50 feet until it ends in a folding ladder with a dangling cord. When unfolded, the ladder reaches another 20 feet to the sewer tunnel floor. When the characters descend to the floor, read:

You stand shin-deep in sewer water, in a dimly lit tunnel. There's a raised walkway on either side that gets you out of the smelly, muck-filled water. Small lamps housing magical flames shed dim light. The walls are covered in moss and lichen.

The tunnel is dimly lit by small continual flame beacons positioned every 30 feet or so on alternating sides of the 20-foot-high tunnel. The sewer tunnel is 30 feet wide and continues in both directions. The tunnel has a raised walkway 5 feet wide and 5 feet tall along both sides. The main passage is flowing with 1-foot-deep water and smelly refuse.

Krenko and three other goblins came this way, heading to his new hideout. The characters can spot signs of grimy boot prints made by Small creatures on one of the walkways by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. After finding the prints, they can continue to track them through the sewer tunnels by succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. For every day since the goblins came through here, add 5 to the DC of the check. It takes 2 hours to navigate the twisting tunnels at normal walking speed. The tunnels are near Golgari territory, but above the undercity.

For each hour the party spends in the sewers, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher, the party has an encounter determined by rolling on the Sewer Encounters table.

#### SEWER ENCOUNTERS

- d20 Encounter
- 1d4 cultists of Rakdos 1-4
- 5-9 2d4 giant rats
- 10-11 1 gray ooze
- 12-14 1 kraul warrior (see chapter 6 for the stat block)
- 1 swarm of insects (centipedes) 15-18
- 19-20 1d4 zombies covered in fungus

The tracks end at another maintenance shaft in the ceiling of the tunnel. A cord dangles down from the shaft; pulling on it releases a folding ladder that can easily be climbed. The shaft terminates in a grate, which can be pushed aside with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

The characters emerge in an alley beside an old warehouse on a canal dock near Foundry Street, in Precinct Six of the Tenth District. The tracks continue up to the warehouse.

### TIN STREET

This bustling market area is busy with the flow of merchants, entertainers, shoppers, and revelers. During daytime hours, Tin Street is a prime destination for shopping and dining. At night, theaters and taverns come alive.

Tin Street is one of the two avenues that traverse the entire Tenth District (see chapter 3). Where it passes through Precinct Six, the Shattergang Brothers have claimed much of it as their turf. They keep a keen eye out for Azorius arresters, rival gang members, and anyone who asks too many questions.

Tin Street is also the home of Falish, a renegade Izzet arms dealer who, for the right price, supplies criminals with weapons and explosives.

#### SHATTERGANG EAVESDROPPING

If a check to gather rumors fails by 5 or more, or the characters are otherwise indiscreet while investigating around Tin Street, word gets to the Shattergang Brothers that someone has been asking about Krenko. They send an unremarkably dressed, beady-eyed goblin. named Erko to tail the characters (about 60 feet) and sneak up to eavesdrop on conversations. If a character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score equals or exceeds the goblin's Dexterity (Stealth) check, that character notices that they're being followed or observed.

If Erko notices the party has seen him, he tries to run away, back to one of his gang's hideouts. As he makes his way down the busy market of Tin Street, you can conduct this scene as a chase, using the chase rules and the Urban Chase Complications table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

In addition to his weapons, Erko carries a flask of alchemist's fire, which he hurls at the first creature that threatens him. See chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook for rules on using alchemist's fire.

If a character interrogates Erko and succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check, the goblin reveals that he works for the Shattergang Brothers, and they have an interest in knowing what goes on in their turf. He doesn't reveal their hideout under any circumstances.

If Erko tails the adventurers long enough to discover Krenko's location, the Shattergang Brothers arrive at Krenko's hideout in force 2 hours later.

#### FINDING FALISH

The renegade Izzet arms dealer Falish lives and works on Tin Street. Characters can ask around the neighborhood to discover the location of her secret shop, but the information doesn't come easy.

Taverns. Falish is a regular at the Millstone, a seedy tavern that caters to the rough and rowdy. The tavern's owner and barkeep is Wyroon, a male minotaur with a cracked horn and a surly disposition. He was drummed out of the Boros Legion for insubordination a few years ago. His starting attitude is indifferent, but if a character succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, he'll tell the characters that Falish comes down some nights for a drink or two. Falish stops by early in the evening of Day 2, without her flamethrower.

Merchants. Very few merchants on Tin Street know Falish, except for a female goblin alchemist named Noggra, who runs an apothecary shop called Noggra's Remedies. Noggra often patches up injured gang members after their scuffles, and occasionally hides them from the law. She sometimes sells Falish alchemical substances to enhance her weapons. Her starting attitude toward the party is indifferent. If a character asks her about Falish and succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, she gives up Falish's location. A character who offers Noggra 10 gp or more makes this check with advantage.

Street Talk. Characters can simply ask around the neighborhood to try to find Falish. If so, use the rules for gathering rumors under "Hitting the Streets."

#### FALISH'S WORKSHOP

Once the characters determine Falish's location and travel there, read:

Following the directions to Falish's shop, you find yourself in an alley behind a restaurant. Near the back door to the establishment is a smaller, padlocked iron door that looks as if it came from a vault.

The door has a padlock that requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to pick with thieves' tools, or a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open. Once it is open, read:

Beyond the door, you see a narrow staircase that leads twenty feet down to a green-tinged copper door, with a closed sliding peephole in its center.

This copper door is locked and requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to open. It can also be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength check. The door is trapped with a glyph of warding spell that triggers when a character attempts to pick the lock or force open the door. The triggered glyph casts sleep at 3rd level, affecting 9d8 hit points of creatures. A character who searches the door for traps can detect the glyph with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

When the characters enter the room, read:

The flickering glow of lanterns reveals a haphazard room that is thirty feet long and twenty feet wide, packed with equipment, tools, and materials. Hanging from the wall are all manner of weapons. Boxes and small crates are stuffed under tables that overflow with flasks. A workbench is piled high with tools. There's a small living area with a bed and a large iron stove in the back of the room.

This room serves as a laboratory, showroom, and living quarters for Falish, a human scorchbringer guard (see chapter 6 for the stat block). She deals in alchemically treated weapons and explosives. A renegade who was expelled from the Izzet League, Falish maintains contacts within the guild, who provide her with the

dah bradi

materials she uses to upgrade weapons. She sells her wares to many of the gangs in the Tenth District.

If characters trigger the glyph trap on the door, Falish grabs her gear and heads out through a secret door in the back of her living quarters as quickly as possible, closing the door behind her. The secret door opens into a tunnel that leads down into the sewers. When closed, the secret door can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

If the characters surprise Falish or manage to sneak in, she realizes she has no quick escape and is willing to cooperate to a certain extent to get the characters out of her home. In exchange for freedom, she reveals the following information:

- · Krenko contacted her to deliver some weapons, explosives, and any magic items she had to a drop point on Foundry Street, outside the Smokehouse Inn. She's supposed to make the drop at sunset on the day after Krenko's escape.
- · Krenko is planning on using the weapons to launch a preemptive attack on the Shattergang Brothers to reassert that he's back in power.
- · Krenko is probably hiding somewhere near the drop point. Falish knows that Krenko and his rescuers were spotted entering a sewer grate west of the plaza.

Treasure. Falish has one of each weapon in the Player's Handbook with a price of no more than 25 gp hanging from the walls of her quarters. On her work tables are three flasks of alchemist's fire, one vial of acid, alchemist's supplies, tinker's tools, a set of thieves' tools, and most of the components needed to assemble two bombs. Under one of the tables is a small, locked strongbox requiring thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to open. Inside the strongbox are 200 zinos (gp), 3 strips of mizzium (a durable magical metal), and an eversmoking bottle.

#### FOUNDRY STREET

Foundry Street is where a lot of the manufacturing happens in the Tenth District. Workers toil day and night to make goods that Ravnicans buy in the market, and to supply the Boros Legion with armor and weapons.

Goblins are common in this part of the city, and it is Krenko's gang's turf. Most of the gang members now know that Krenko has escaped, and the bickering between his enforcers has subsided with Krenko back on the streets.

Most of the folk who live around Foundry Street know to report any Azorius presence or nosy outsiders to a goblin gang member that serves as the block captain. If the characters conduct their investigation here, Krenko's gang learns about it within half an hour and sends out a crew to deal with the situation.

#### WELCOMING PARTY

Krenko's goblin gang approaches the characters. Their starting attitude is hostile, and they hurl insults and try to get the characters to leave their turf. If the adventurers don't comply, the goblins fight them. If more than half the goblins are defeated, the remaining gang members try to escape.

The gang that approaches the groups consists of six goblin gang members (see the stat block). A character who interrogates a captured goblin and succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check learns Krenko's location. Alternatively, a character who offers the goblins a bribe of 10 gp or more and succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check can get the same information.

#### SHATTERGANG'S RESPONSE

Late in the evening on Day 2, the Shattergang Brothers blow up three of Krenko's safe houses along Foundry Street. The explosions attract the Azorius Senate, which sends twenty soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block) to secure the area and question bystanders.

Characters who are causing trouble with the locals around Foundry Street during this time might be detained at the Foundry Street arrester station for questioning. Characters are detained for 1d4 hours unless one of them succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check, which shortens the time to 10 minutes.

# KRENKO'S HIDEOUT

The characters can locate Krenko's hideout either by interrogating members of his gang, following the tracks from the sewer, or following a goblin back from the drop point where Falish leaves Krenko's weapons. Once they have found the warehouse, read:

A large, soot-stained wooden building with a faded symbol of the Boros Legion sits at the edge of a canal, its timbers cracked and singed. A closed bay door faces north toward the water, and a wooden track runs from the building all the way to the edge of a pier. A similar bay door faces south toward the main street. On the alley sides of the building are two doors-a double door on the west side, and a single door on the east side.

This old warehouse used to store equipment finished from the nearby foundries for the Boros Legion's use. It was badly burned in a gang war a few years ago and has since been abandoned by the Boros. Krenko's gang has used it occasionally as a secret meeting spot, and now Krenko is using it as his hideout.

The warehouse is 40 feet tall, 60 feet wide, and 120 feet long. It has no windows, but the outer walls are brittle and fire-damaged; a number of small holes, 1 or 2 feet in diameter, have opened up in various places. Dealing 5 damage to a section of the wall creates an opening that a Medium or smaller creature can walk through.

### KRENKO'S GANG

All members of Krenko's gang are goblin gang members (see the stat block). Each goblin carries a whistle (worn on a rope around its neck), which it can blow as an action to sound the alarm. A goblin might carry an-

#### LOOKOUTS

A goblin (see "Krenko's Gang" for modified statistics) is posted outside each door. If a guard sees one or more characters approaching the warehouse, it signals the other guards by blowing a whistle around its neck. It remains vigilant but doesn't signal the others if the characters are visible on the street but don't make their way to the warehouse. The goblins don't use a light source at night, relying on their darkvision.

Characters might take the time to observe the lookouts from afar. The rooftops of nearby buildings make excellent vantage points. The buildings across the main street are 50 feet away; those in the alleys are 20 feet away.

#### CHANGING OF THE GUARD

Every 4 hours, new goblins from Krenko's gang arrive to relieve the lookouts. During this time, they're usually distracted as they chat among themselves for 1d10 minutes. While they're distracted, characters have advantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide or move quietly in the area.

### DAY 2 ARRIVALS

At noon on the second day, four more goblins arrive. Two position themselves inside on the catwalk, and two walk the warehouse floor.

### DAY 3 CHAOS

In the small hours of the third day, the Shattergang Brothers finally manage to discover Krenko's whereabouts and send a team of ten goblins to toss bombs at the warehouse and its occupants.

In addition to their normal gear, these goblins each carry one bomb. As an action, a goblin can light a bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) fire damage.

Any survivors of Krenko's gang flee the warehouse and scatter into the city after this assault.

# WAREHOUSE LOCATIONS

The following locations are keyed to map 4.11, which shows the interior of the warehouse.

### OFFICE

This room is unlit. If the characters have darkvision or a light source, describe the room as follows:

This room is twenty feet square and has a ten-foot-high ceiling. It appears to be an office and makeshift living quarters. A heavy wooden table stands in the center of the room, ringed by six chairs. Under it is an iron box. To the south is a cot covered in blankets. Beside it is a sack full of clothes and the remains of several meals served on fine dinnerware. A door sits in the middle of the wall to the east, with a large window beside it offering a view of the warehouse beyond.

Krenko (see below) is holed up here-with two goblin bosses that serve as his enforcers-planning a preemptive strike on the Shattergang Brothers. In addition to his weapons, Krenko carries a vial of acid, a flask of alchemist's fire, a bag of caltrops, a vial of basic poison, and the key to the iron strongbox (see "Treasure" below).

| KRENKO |  |  |  |  |  |

| Challenge 1 (200 XP) |  |  |  |  |  |

Nimble Escape. Krenko can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of his turns.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. Krenko makes two attacks with his scimitar.

Scimitar. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) poison damage.

Light Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80/320. ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

#### REACTIONS

Redirect Attack. When a creature Krenko can see targets him with an attack, Krenko chooses another goblin within 5 feet of him. The two goblins swap places, and the chosen goblin becomes the target instead.

#### TREASURE

The iron strongbox under a desk contains funds Krenko was gathering to pay off Falish. It is locked and can be opened with the key in Krenko's possession, or with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Inside the box are 350 zinos (gp), two gold rings inset with small rubies (worth 50 gp each), and a potion of giant strength (hill).

### CATWALK

A 3-foot-wide wooden catwalk is attached to the inside walls of the warehouse 20 feet above the floor. A creaky, charred, narrow, wrap-around wooden staircase near the center of the east wall leads up to it.

Two goblin gang members (see the stat block) patrol the catwalk at all times, rotating in a similar way to the lookouts outside.

#### WEAKENED STAIRCASE

One of the steps of the catwalk staircase is ready to collapse. This fragile board is located 10 feet off the ground and can be spotted by anyone on the stairs who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher. A creature that weighs more than 100 pounds that steps on the board must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall 10 feet to the ground below. The gap that the collapsing board creates can be easily avoided by other creatures walking up the stairs.

If one side of the catwalk takes 10 or more damage, that side collapses. Creatures on the walkway when this happens fall 20 feet to the warehouse floor below.

### MAIN FLOOR

The warehouse is lit inside by lanterns placed on hooks located 5 feet up on the wall every 30 feet or so, below the catwalk. The goblins keep this area brightly lit, since their darkvision only extends for 60 feet. When the characters enter, read:

The glowing lantern light reveals a warehouse charred by a fire. To the north and south are large, iron-reinforced bay doors, operated from the ground by chains and pulleys. The western wall has a square room in the center that fills a twenty-foot-by-twenty-foot section of the warehouse floor. The room has a door and window on the side facing the center of the warehouse floor.

A catwalk encircles the interior twenty feet above the floor. Stairs lead up to it near the center of the eastern wall. Dozens of large boxes and crates are scattered around the warehouse, their integrity in question due to fire damage. A pair of wooden rails runs through the center of the room. On the rails sits a giant wooden wheeled cart. Towering over the cart is a ten-foot-high, soot-stained iron statue. It looks vaguely humanoid, with claw-like appendages at the ends of its arms. In place of its head is a cavity containing a seat with a series of levers all around it.

Antimagic Susceptibility. The rig is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the rig must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

Unstable. If the rig takes damage, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated with a speed of 0 until a creature activates it with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check made as an action.

#### ACTIONS

170

Multiattack. The armor makes two melee attacks.

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

Dealing 20 damage or more to a bay door creates a hole that a Medium or smaller creature can walk through. A character can use an action to open a bay door using its pulley system.

Charred and cracked wooden containers are scattered around the room. Nothing of value remains in any of them.

Resting on the rails that run through the center of the room is a Large cart. The north and south walls of the cart can be lowered to create ramps leading up to the cart's bed.

Near the cart is a loading rig (see the stat block) covered in soot and currently inactive. A seat cavity built into the top the rig contains a series of small plates and levers. A creature in the seat can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check to figure out how to press the plates in the correct sequence to activate or deactivate the rig. Pressing the plates requires an action. Once the rig is activated, a creature in the seat can pilot it using the levers. The rig moves as its controller directs it, and the controller can use an action to direct the rig to take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action, or the Multiattack or Slam actions as given in its stat block.

A creature with tinker's tools can try to repair damage to the rig. After spending 1 hour making repairs, the creature makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, the rig regains 1d6 hit points.

### CONFRONTING KRENKO

Krenko tries to escape if he is reduced to half his hit points or fewer, ordering his goblin enforcers cover him as he makes his getaway. He runs to the loading rig on the warehouse floor and activates it in an effort to fight his way out and flee. If he can get outside, he makes his way to the dock and jumps into the canal to swim away.

If Krenko is captured, he tries to convince the adventurers that bringing him to justice isn't in the best interest of the city. He might make any or all of the following arguments in his defense:

- · Without his leadership, the goblin gangs have been thrown into chaos, and the only thing keeping the Shattergang Brothers from blowing things up is his gang-with him leading it.
- . He is emphatic that his killing of Dargig was an act of self-defense and that he was framed by the Boros Legion, which he suspects is in league with the Shattergang Brothers. Characters who succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check sense he's lying, as he subtly looks past them while making his plea.
- Krenko is willing to offer the party a deal. He'll give them everything in his office strongbox if they tell Nassius they didn't find him.
- · Krenko warns the party that Nassius isn't all he appears to be. Krenko suspects that Nassius is in someone's pocket but doesn't know who that someone is.

Krenko doesn't offer up any information on the allies that aided him in his escape, but he identifies them if pressed. He also remains tight-lipped on the subject of Mr. Taz, offering only the following if a character makes a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check: "Mr. Taz gave me a nice shiv as a present for a job once, and I'd love to get my mitts on another one someday.

# THE HANDOFF

When the characters reach the meeting point that Nassius specified, read the following:

As the rain intensifies into a downpour, you head to the outskirts of the Tenth District. You're directed to the old granary that Nassius picked as the rendezvous point. The wet, crumbling clay building sits out in an untended field and is overgrown with all manner of vegetation, almost completely reclaimed by the wild. Nassius steps out of the entryway into the field, holding a small purse and flanked by two heavily armed guards.

Nassius has asked for Azorius assistance but has also brought two human veterans wearing no obvious guild identifiers to help take Krenko into custody. Six Azorius soldiers (see chapter 6 for the stat block) are hidden in various spots between 50 and 100 feet of the front of the granary, ready to subdue characters who make a wrong move, or to take down Krenko if he tries to flee.

Nassius wants the characters to complete the exchange without a fuss and head home. He asks them if they questioned Krenko, and to recount what the goblin said to them. Krenko attempts to call out Nassius as a liar and a corrupt official, but Nassius's veterans move to gag Krenko to stop him from talking.

Nassius doesn't answer any questions about where he's taking Krenko, nor does he address the veracity of any claims of corruption. He remarks that he serves the office of the Guildpact, and he's taking Krenko in for the good of the city. The Shattergang Brothers might still take over the turf of Krenko's gang, but probably without a destructive gang war.

### NASSIUS'S PATRON

Krenko was right about one thing: Nassius Ven has been using his position to keep himself wealthy and protected. A patron approached Nassius and made a deal to have Krenko delivered to them instead of to his rightful place in his new cell at Udzec. Nassius was assured that Krenko would eventually make his way back to the prison alive, but the patron wanted to have a few words with him first.

To determine whom Nassius Ven cut a deal with, you can roll to determine a patron from the table below, or you can choose one. If the patron is a guild, you should select a guild that isn't represented by an adventurer in the party. The patron might influence future dealings with both Nassius Ven and Krenko.

#### NASSIUS'S PATRON

| de | Patron |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Azorius Senate |
|  | Boros Legion |
|  | Mr. Taz |
| U + W N | Orzhov Syndicate |
|  | Shattergang Brothers |
| ୧ | Selesnya Conclave |

# THE END?

The characters earn 1 renown in their guild if they deliver Krenko to Nassius.

In addition to the adventure seeds in the first part of this chapter, you can build on the events of this adventure to chart a course for the party's next adventures. Consider these questions:

- · Who were Krenko's and Nassius's allies? How might they respond to the characters' actions?
- · What's the balance of power between Krenko's gang and the Shattergang Brothers? Is either gang likely to take revenge on the characters for what they did? Or did the characters earn the gratitude of either gang?
- · How might Nassius, Krenko, Falish, and other NPCs interact with the adventurers in the future? Could one of them ask for the characters' help with a new crisis, or turn into a dangerous antagonist?
- Did the characters use any of their contacts to gather information? Might those individuals' involvement cause them trouble that could involve the adventurers?

# CHAPTER 5: TREASURES

HOSE WHO ARE BOLD OR CUNNING ENOUGH can find treasures aplenty to reward their exploits in Ravnica. Coins change hands in back alleys, chests of riches are laden onto beasts of burden, and fine objects of art stand on display in museums and galleries. Obscene wealth lies secreted away in Orzhov vaults, the Azorius Senate's payroll is a bureaucratic tangle, and House Dimir greases countless palms with an apparently endless fortune. And items of magic lure adventurers and thieves with the promise of greater power.

# COINS IN TREASURE

When you use the treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, you can change the type of coinage found if you'd like to associate the coins with a particular guild. For more information about coinage in Ravnica, see the "Currency: Zibs and Zinos" section in this book's introduction.

Copper pieces encountered in treasure are either standard Azorius zibs or Orzhov alms-coins. A pouch of alms-coins might belong to someone who has been impoverished-or someone who makes a habit of robbing from the poor. A chest full of alms-coins could be an Orzhov lockbox used to hold the coins before they are distributed to the poor.

Silver coins minted by the Azorius Senate are worth 25 cp, so they might be found in smaller numbers than the standard silver pieces mentioned on the treasure tables. They are common currency, so they're found in the coin purses of virtually everyone in Ravnica. A hoard of silver coins might be amassed by a miser or stored in a bank vault (or stolen from such places).

Electrum pieces found in treasure are Azorius 50-zib coins. These coins are more common than electrum pieces are on most other D&D worlds, and they serve a function very similar to the silver 25-zib coins. You might reflect this fact by turning some silver pieces found as treasure into electrum pieces.

Gold coins in treasure translate directly to 1-zino coins, which could be the standard coins of Azorius mint or Boros coins (which might have been used as the weekly pay of a soldier in the Legion). A treasure might include Boros 5-zino coins, representing the salary of an officer or a payment made from the Legion to another guild.

Platinum pieces found in treasure are Orzhov 10-zino coins. They might have originally belonged to an Orzhov pontiff. Perhaps they were withdrawn from an account in an Orzhov bank-which suggests someone wealthy and powerful, possibly with criminal connections. A significant treasure find might include a stash of Orzhov 100-zino coins (one-tenth the number of platinum pieces found on the treasure table), which almost certainly belongs to a powerful Orzhov scion who wants it back.

# GUILD CHARMS

A guild charm is a magical effect placed on an otherwise mundane item. Charms are often given to favored members of the guild-those whose renown scores with their guilds have reached 10 or higher-or those entrusted with important missions. A charm typically manifests as the guild's symbol emblazoned on an item that is worn or carried by the chosen creature.

A guild charm can be used only a certain number of times before it vanishes, and only by the creature upon which it was bestowed. If you use a charm to cast a spell, you can do so without expending a spell slot or providing any components. The spell's save DC is 15, its attack bonus is +7, and the spellcasting ability modifier for any spell effects is +4.

A charm can't be used in the area created by an antimagic field spell or a similar effect. The guildmaster of the charm's guild can revoke the charm as an action, but otherwise the charm can't be removed from the object on which it was placed by anything short of divine intervention or a wish spell.

The charms associated with each guild are described below.

#### AZORIUS CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the hold person (3rd-level version), command, or counterspell spell. The charm vanishes after you activate it.

#### BOROS CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the crusader's mantle or haste spell. Alternatively, you can cast the guiding bolt spell, and if it hits, you regain a number of hit points equal to the damage it deals. The charm vanishes after you activate it.

#### DIMIR CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the blink or sleep (3rd-level version) spell. Alternatively, when you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. The charm vanishes after you activate it.

#### GOLGARI CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the dispel magic, false life (3rd-level version), or stinking cloud spell. The charm vanishes after you activate it.

#### GRUUL CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the heroism or thunderwave spell (3rd-level versions). Alternatively, as a reaction when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another attack against the target you missed. The charm vanishes after you activate it.

#### IZZET CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the dispel magic or lightning bolt spell. Alternatively, as an action, you can regain one expended spell slot of 3rd level or lower. The charm vanishes after you activate it.

#### ORZHOV CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the bestow curse or fear spell. Alternatively, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to have it drop to 1 hit point instead. The charm vanishes after you activate it.

#### RAKDOS CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the crown of madness, hellish rebuke, or shatter spell. The charm vanishes after you activate it.

#### SELESNYA CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the aura of vitality or conjure animals spell. Alternatively, as an action, you can give up to three creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the end of your next turn. The charm vanishes after you activate it.

#### SIMIC CHARM

When you activate this charm, you can cast the enhance ability (3rd-level version), enlarge/reduce, or gaseous form spell. The charm vanishes after you activate it.

# MAGIC ITEMS

Magic items are abundant on Ravnica. Izzet workshops and foundries create a plethora of wild and often dangerous items, and spellcasters from every guild craft items for their own use and that of their guild mates. More powerful items are created in grand experiments or by angelic blessings, or they find their way out of hidden vaults and ancient underground ruins.

### GUILDS AND MAGIC ITEMS

Each of Ravnica's guilds has an affinity for certain magic items. This section identifies the magic items most likely to be created, used, or valued by each guild. The lists include the magic items in this book (referred to as GGR) and in the Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG) that are particularly appropriate for the guilds.

The guild lists are by no means comprehensive; the guilds are happy to use whatever resources become available to them, magical or otherwise. But the items shown here are particularly prized and even coveted by the guilds. Word of the discovery of a holy avenger, for example, can mobilize a whole Boros garrison to search for it and claim it for the legion's use. And if such an item is stolen from the Boros, the legion will go to equal lengths to reclaim it and punish the thieves.

Some items created on Ravnica are prized by all the guilds; they are listed on the General Items table.

#### IZZET ITEMS

The Izzet League is the most prolific creator of magic items in Ravnica. Its inventions can be unpredictable and downright dangerous, but they can also be useful tools, weapons, and implements of magical manipulation. Izzet researchers are prone to giving their magic items special names, so what one person might call a staff of thunder and lightning might be an electrosonic field manipulator to its Izzet wielder.

#### ORZHOV ITEMS

The oligarchs and pontiffs of the Orzhov Syndicate view possession of magic items as a mark of status, whether those items are ostentatiously on display or hidden away in a vault. Items that the guild creates are often extremely ornate; Orzhov-made wings of flying, for example, might have the appearance of bird wings where every feather looks like colorful stained glass. Items that magically increase the wearer's imposing presence and authority are especially coveted in the syndicate.

#### RAKDOS ITEMS

Fire, pain, spectacle, and just enough random destruction to make life enjoyable-that's all Rakdos cultists want out of their magic items. Items that magically create fire, leave lingering wounds, instill fear, or randomly devour objects put inside them are all sources of delight for members of the Cult of Rakdos.

#### SIMIC ITEMS

The Simic Combine spends more of its time altering the biological processes of living creatures than it does working on magic items. Its preferred items either facilitate physical transformation or are creatures themselves-symbiotic life forms engineered to provide Simic researchers and soldiers with new capabilities.

#### MAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS

This section presents an assortment of magic items in alphabetical order. See the Dungeon Master's Guide for the rules on magic items.

#### GUILD KEYRUNE

Wondrous item, rarity by keyrune (requires attunement by a member of the relevant guild)

Associated with a particular guild, a guild keyrune is a ceremonial, stylized key, about 1 foot long, made from carved stone. Not a literal key, the item is a badge of authority that gives its bearer access to privileged places in its guild's headquarters and outposts. At the DM's discretion, a character might be given a keyrune upon attaining a renown score of 25 in their guild.

When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a creature. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. See the Monster Manual for the creature's stat block-the name of which is given in bold in the keyrune's description-unless you're directed to chapter 6 of this book instead.

The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each keyrune. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.

Azorius Keyrune (Rare). This keyrune is carved from white marble and lapis lazuli to resemble a noble bird of prey. It can become a giant eagle for up to 1 hour. While the transformed eagle is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. As an action, you can see through the eagle's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, and you gain the benefit of its keen sight. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

GOLGARI KEYRUN

Boros Keyrune (Rare). Carved from red sandstone with white granite elements to resemble a member of the Boros Legion, this keyrune can become a veteran (human) for up to 8 hours. In addition to fighting on your behalf, this veteran cheerfully offers tactical advice, which is usually sound. Anyone who talks with the transformed keyrune or examines it closely can easily recognize that it is an artificial human.

Dimir Keyrune (Very Rare). This keyrune, carved from black stone accented with steel, resembles a stylized horror. On command, it transforms into an intellect devourer that resembles the Dimir guild symbol, with six bladelike legs. The creature exists for up to 24 hours. During that time, it pursues only a single mission you give it-usually an assignment to take over someone's body, either to impersonate that person for a brief time or to extract secrets from their mind. When the mission is complete, the creature returns to you, reports its success, and reverts to its keyrune form.

Golgari Keyrune (Very Rare). Made from deep green jade with black veins, this keyrune has an insectile shape. It can transform into a giant scorpion for up to 6 hours. The scorpion has an Intelligence of 4 and can communicate with you telepathically while it is within 60 feet of you, though its messages are largely limited to describing the passage of potential prey.

Gruul Keyrune (Rare). This crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and animal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a rhinoceros (and with the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.

Izzet Keyrune (Rare). Formed of carved and polished red and blue stone, the keyrune includes bits of cable and wire. One end resembles a humanlike head, suggesting the jagged elemental form of the galvanice weird (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that it can become for a duration of 3 hours. In this form, it will serve you as a bodyguard, lift and carry things for you, act as a test subject for your experiments, or aid you in any other way that its capabilities allow.

Orzhov Keyrune (Rare). This keyrune is carved from white marble with veins of black. The end is shaped like a thrull's head, with a gold faceplate affixed. On command, the keyrune transforms into a winged thrull (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 2 hours. If you don't come from an Orzhov oligarch family, it serves you grudgingly, clownishly aping your movements and mannerisms while carrying out your orders.

Rakdos Keyrune (Uncommon). This dark granite keyrune is marbled with scarlet veins and carved with the leering visage of a mischievous demon. When activated, it transforms into a cackler (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 1 hour.

Selesnya Keyrune (Rare). Carved from white and green marble in the shape of a wolf's head, this keyrune transforms into a dire wolf. The wolf persists for 8 hours. Its Intelligence is 6, and it understands Elvish and Sylvan but can't speak those languages. While it is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each other telepathically.

Simic Keyrune (Uncommon). This keyrune is assembled from coral, mother-of-pearl, and chrome and adorned with the spirals and curves characteristic of Simic ornamentation. The head resembles the shell of a sea creature. On command, the keyrune turns into a category 1 krasis (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that has the Grabber and Stabilizing Legs adaptations. The transformation lasts for up to 5 hours.

#### GUILD SIGNET

#### Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)

This ring, adorned with the symbol of a guild, allows you to cast one spell closely associated with that guild, as shown in the Guild Signet Spells table. A guild signet is sometimes awarded to a guild member whose renown score in that guild is 5 or higher, as a reward for performing special services for the guild. Aside from its magical properties, the ring is also an indicator of the guild's recognition and favor.

A signet has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast the associated spell (save DC 13).

#### GUILD SIGNET SPELLS

| Guild | Associated Spell |
| --- | --- |
| Azorius | ensnaring strike |
| Boros | heroism |
| Dimir | disguise self |
| Golgari | entangle |
| Gruul | compelled duel |
| Izzet | chaos bolt (see chapter 2) |
| Orzhov | command |
| Rakdos | hellish rebuke |
| Selesnya | charm person |
| Simic | expeditious retreat |

#### ILLUSIONIST'S BRACERS

#### Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

A powerful illusionist of House Dimir originally developed these bracers, which enabled her to create multiple minor illusions at once. The bracers' power, though, extends far beyond illusions.

While wearing the bracers, whenever you cast a cantrip, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to cast that cantrip a second time.

#### MIZZIUM

Mizzium is a magic-infused steel alloy used by the Izzet League in a tremendous variety of ways, from providing the physical structure of weirds to crafting the tools used in other manufacturing. Runic markings help to channel and control the elemental energy that flows through the metal.

The magical properties of the metal are difficult to define succinctly. It is as hard as adamantine, except when it is transformed into a gaseous suspension. It has a high melting point, except when it is found in liquid form at cool autumn temperatures. Izzet chemisters can readily explain that mizzium helps to maximize metasteam potentials, realize fractional element-binding, and transduce local weird-field radicals, but no one understands what any of that means.

#### MIZZIUM APPARATUS

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)

Innovation is a dangerous pursuit, at least the way the mages of the Izzet League engage in it. As protection against the risk of an experiment going awry, they have developed a device to help channel and control their magic. This apparatus is a collection of leather straps, flexible tubing, glass cylinders, and plates, bracers, and fittings made from a magic-infused metal alloy called mizzium, all assembled into a harness. The item weighs 8 pounds.

While you are wearing the mizzium apparatus, you can use it as an arcane focus. In addition, you can attempt to cast a spell that you do not know or have prepared. The spell you choose must be on your class's spell list and of a level for which you have a spell slot, and you must provide the spell's components.

You expend a spell slot to cast the spell as normal, but before resolving it you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DC is 10 + twice the level of the spell slot you expend to cast the spell.

On a successful check, you cast the spell as normal, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier. On a failed check, you cast a different spell from the one you intended. Randomly determine the spell you cast by rolling on the table for the level of the spell slot you expended. If the slot is 6th level or higher, roll on the table for 5th-level spells.

If you try to cast a cantrip you don't know, the DC for the Intelligence (Arcana) check is 10, and on a failed check, there is no effect.

#### MIZZIUM ARMOR

Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), rare

This suit of armor is reinforced with a magically enhanced metal alloy called mizzium, which is made in Izzet foundries. While you're wearing the armor, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. In addition, when you are subjected to a magical effect that allows you to make a Strength or Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.

#### MIZZIUM MORTAR

#### Wondrous item, rare

This short tube, about 2 feet long and 6 inches in diameter, is made from mizzium, a magically enhanced metal alloy forged by the Izzet League. The end that's pointed toward a target is open, and a glowing ball of molten metal can be seen at the other end as long as the mortar has at least 1 charge remaining.

The mortar has 4 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

Molten Spray. You can expend 1 charge as an action to loose a 30-foot cone of molten mizzium. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving

throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Mizzium Bombard. You can expend 3 charges as an action to launch a hail of molten projectiles in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### MOODMARK PAINT

#### Wondrous item, common

This thick, black paint is stored in a small jar, containing enough paint to apply moodmarks to one creature. The paint is dabbed on the face in spots or markings that often resemble the eyes of insects or spiders. Applying the paint in this way takes 1 minute.

For the next 8 hours, the marks change to reflect your mental state. A creature that can see you and makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check can discern whether you are happy, sad, angry, disgusted, surprised, or afraid, as well as the main source of that emotion. For example, you might communicate fear caused by a monster you just saw around the corner, grief at the loss of a friend, or happiness derived from pride in your performance in combat. A dark elf has advantage on this check.

#### PARIAH'S SHIELD

#### Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)

Soldiers of the Boros Legion consider it an honor to bear this shield, even knowing that it might be the last honor they receive. The front of the shield is sculpted to depict a grieving human face.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC for every two allies within 5 feet of you (up to a maximum of +3) while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to take that damage, instead of the creature taking it. When you do so, the damage type changes to force.

MOODMARK PAINT

#### PEREGRINE MASK

#### Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

While wearing this winged helm, you have a flying speed of 60 feet. In addition, you have advantage on initiative rolls.

#### PYROCONVERGER

#### Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

A pyroconverger is an Izzet-made flamethrower. It carries a risk of malfunction each time you use it.

As an action, you can cause the pyroconverger to project fire in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Each time you use the pyroconverger, roll a d10 and add the number of times you have used it since your last long rest. If the total is 11 or higher, the pyroconverger malfunctions: you take 4d6 fire damage, and you can't use the pyroconverger again until you finish a long rest.

#### RAKDOS RITEKNIFE

#### Weapon (dagger), legendary (requires attunement)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Its blade is cruelly serrated, and its hilt resembles a demonic head and wings. Whenever you slay a creature with an attack using the dagger. the creature's soul is imprisoned inside the dagger, and that creature can be restored to life only by a wish spell. The dagger can hold a maximum of five souls.

For each soul imprisoned in the dagger, your attacks with it deal an extra 1d4 necrotic damage on a hit. While the dagger is within 5 feet of you, your dreams are haunted by whispers from the trapped souls.

The dagger has the following additional properties. Siphon Vitality. As a bonus action, you can release any number of stored souls from the dagger to regain 1d10 hit points per soul released.

Annihilation. If the dagger holds five souls, you can use this property: As a reaction immediately after you hit a creature with the dagger and deal damage to that target, you can release all five souls. If the target now has fewer than 75 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. If the target dies, you can't use this property again until you finish a long rest.

#### SKYBLINDER STAFF

#### Staff, uncommon (requires attunement)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. While holding it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.

If a flying creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to hold the staff aloft and cause it to flare with light. The attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll, and it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of its next turn.

#### SPIES' MURMUR

#### Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

This headpiece, crafted from dark metal, is worn curved around the ear. If you know a creature wearing another spies' murmur and that creature is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate telepathically with each other. As a bonus action, you can allow that creature to hear everything you hear for 1 hour. You can end this effect as a bonus action, and it ends if you're incapacitated.

#### SUNFORGER

#### Weapon (warhammer), rare (requires attunement)

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

As an action, you can hurl the weapon up to 120 feet to a point you can see. When it reaches that point, the weapon vanishes in an explosion, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Afterward, you can use an action to cause the weapon to reappear in your empty hand. You can't cause it to explode again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you don't call the weapon back to your hand, it reappears at the point where it exploded when you are no longer attuned to it or when 24 hours have passed.

#### SWORD OF THE PARUNS

#### Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, once on each of your turns, you can use one of the following properties if you're holding the sword:

- · Immediately after you use the Attack action to attack with the sword, you can enable one creature within 60 feet of you to use its reaction to make one weapon attack.
- Immediately after you take the Dash action, you can enable one creature within 60 feet of you to use its reaction to move up to its speed.
- Immediately after you take the Dodge action, you can enable one creature within 60 feet of you to use its reaction to gain the benefits of the Dodge action.

#### VOYAGER STAFF

#### Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. While you hold it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: banishment (4 charges), blink (3 charges), misty step (2 charges), passwall (5 charges), or teleport (7 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes forever.

# CHAPTER 6: FRIENDS AND FOES

AVNICA IS HOME TO A GREAT VARIETY OF creatures, including some that are unknown on other worlds in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. This chapter provides stat blocks for many of these creatures, and it concludes with a collection of nonplayer characters who fill the ranks of Ravnica's guilds.

Some of the stat blocks in this book have a special feature: guild spells. If a stat block says its creature is a spellcaster of a particular guild-an Izzet spellcaster, for instance-that creature's spell list includes one or more spells from that guild's spell list. See chapter 2 for the guilds' lists.

### CREATURES BY GUILD

This section is a list of creatures in this chapter and in the Monster Manual that are associated with each guild. Each guild's entry includes a brief discussion of the monsters from the Monster Manual that could be found among the guild's members, and it includes a table showing monsters sorted by challenge rating.

Most of these monsters are in this book (GGR) or the Monster Manual (MM), but some of the monsters from Volo's Guide to Monsters (VGM) and Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes (MTF) are also mentioned.

#### AZORIUS CREATURES

Most creatures associated with the Azorius Senate are humanoids (largely humans and vedalken) and various others that serve as familiars, pets, and mounts. Owls are popular familiars, since they are viewed as symbols of wisdom and sound judgment. Sphinxes and archons are the rare nonhumanoids that play a significant role in the leadership and operation of the guild.

Azorius lawmages craft one-eyed homunculi to perform menial tasks in Azorius buildings. These homunculi use the statistics of a regular homunculus except that they are wingless and have no flying speed.

#### SPHINXES OF JUDGMENT

Azorius sphinxes, known as sphinxes of judgment, wield hieromancy-the power of law magic-with the force of a judge's gavel to imprison criminals and compel truth from them. A sphinx of judgment is a gynosphinx, as described in the Monster Manual, but it is an Azorius spellcaster with the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): friends, mage hand, message 1st level (4 slots): command, ensnaring strike, shield 2nd level (3 slots): calm emotions, hold person, suggestion

- 3rd level (3 slots): clairvoyance, counterspell, dispel magic
- 4th level (3 slots): banishment, divination 5th level (1 slot): dominate person

### BOROS CREATURES

The Boros Legion employs many different creatures to swell the ranks of its soldiery. These creatures might serve as companions, guardians, or mounts.

#### FLAME-KIN

Flame-kin (which use the azer stat block in the Monster Manual) are elemental soldiers magically created and animated to serve the legion as scouts and shock troops. Fanatical and inflexible, they are relics of a time when the guild was more concerned with zealotry than justice. They take the field for large military engagements.

#### DIMIR CREATURES

Alongside human and vampire spies and assassins, a variety of stealthy and shadowy monsters contribute to the work of House Dimir. Doppelgangers and invisible stalkers move unseen among the populace. Horrors-as well as gricks, intellect devourers, and similar monsters-are thought to be the fears of Ravnica's populace given form by Dimir magic. And undead such as shadows, wraiths, and Nightveil specters keep watch over secret Dimir territories.

### GOLGARI CREATURES

The Devkarin elves (drow), deadly medusas, and insectile kraul are the three most important power groups among the Golgari Swarm, vying for control over a teeming horde of lesser (or at least less ambitious) creatures.

#### ERSTWHILE

A significant shift in the Golgari balance of power began when the kraul death priest Mazirek discovered an ancient mausoleum compound. Deep in the undercity, beneath the layers of civilization that had built up over millennia, Mazirek found a hidden network of vaults called Umerilek, an enormous structure that would have dominated a city block. Inside were hundreds of well-preserved corpses suffused with a latent necromantic power that Mazirek activated, bringing the corpses back to a shambling semblance of life. This new race of undead is called the Erstwhile (equivalent to the wight in the Monster Manual).

In their time, the Erstwhile were aristocratic elves of immense wealth and opulence. They still wear their stately attire, despite its moldering condition, and they lend an air of high culture to the undercity court of the Golgari.

#### FUNGUS

Golgari territory is filled with creatures composed of fungus and detritus from the guild's rot farms. Shriekers serve as sentries in Golgari tunnels, and violet fungus sprouts from the corpses of intruders. Amorphous masses of dead and decaying matter can develop into shambling mounds in the spore-saturated environment of the undercity.

Some Golgari creatures are symbiotic fusions of fungus and living creatures. Golgari trolls are hulking sewer dwellers with fungus adorning their bodies like manes, acting as extra layers for their already tough hide and facilitating their regeneration.

#### INSECTS AND ARACHNIDS

Beetles, centipedes, spiders, and countless other insects and arachnids infest Golgari warrens. These creatures, often associated with decay and rebirth, are prized by the guild. Giant bugs serve as beasts of burden, companions, steeds, and guardians. Among the largest of these is the Deadbridge goliath beetle (equivalent to the triceratops in the Monster Manual).

Piranha beetles (best represented as a swarm of insects, from the Monster Manual) burrow through the soft earth and gather into swarms to overtake their victims and strip the flesh from them. Skein spiders (as giant spiders, from the Monster Manual) are an important part of Golgari reclamation work: fungus grows rapidly along the silken spiderwebs, expanding to engulf architecture and hasten the Golgari annexation process.

#### ZOMBIES

The guild encourages the use and exploration of necromancy. Fungus covers the bodies of most of the undead that serve the guild, the majority of which are fungus drudges (equivalent to zombies in the Monster Manual)-mindless servants animated by the fungus that infests their bodies.

#### GRUUL CREATURES

Many dangerous creatures haunt the rubblebelts and other places the Gruul Clans inhabit.

#### BEASTS

Gruul territory is full of beasts of all sizes. Herds of giant boars (see the Monster Manual) called batterboars roam the rubblebelts; each batterboar can grow to be the size of a mammoth (as in the Monster Manual), and the passage of a herd can shake the ground and topple buildings. Maaka (use the saber-toothed tiger stat block from the Monster Manual) are territorial cats, about 15 feet long, with six eyes. They typically keep to the rubblebelts, though from time to time they are spotted amid tended groves and gardens.

Any beast described in this book or in the Monster Manual can roam the rubblebelts. The Gruul can bring out the fury in these beasts, turning them into ragebeasts. Ragebeasts often have the Reckless and Siege Monster traits:

Reckless. At the start of its turn, the ragebeast can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

Siege Monster. The ragebeast deals double damage to objects and structures.

#### ELEMENTALS

Gruul shamans channel primal energies to summon raging fire elementals that blaze ahead of marauding Gruul bands. Or they transform the rubble and detritus of civilization into earth elementals, twisted through with choking vines, that literally give new life to the ruin of the city. These elementals are intensely destructive, but they last only as long as the magic used to summon them persists.

#### GIANTS

Nearly all the Gruul Clans include hill giants, stone giants, cyclopes, ogres, ettins, and fomorians among their number, and one clan-the Bolrac clan-is composed entirely of such brutes.

#### HYDRAS

Once a hydra chooses a lair and declares the surrounding land its territory, it's almost impossible to drive the creature out. The Gruul revere these multiheaded predators as vestiges of the ancient times before the guilds took over the world. They don't kill hydras for trophies, but pulling a spine from a hydra's neck is a mark of great bravery among the Gruul.

#### IZZET CREATURES

Izzet laboratories are staffed with attendants (commoners) and chemisters (mages). Pixies and sprites (called ratchet faeries) find employment among the Izzet working on projects that are too small for other races.

The Izzet League employs elementals formed from the combination of two or more elemental forces, including mephits of the smoke, steam, ice, and magma varieties.

### ORZHOV CREATURES

The Orzhov Syndicate attracts and entraps beings of all kinds, from lowly bats and manufactured thrulls to brutal giants and exalted angels. Orzhov gargoyles, animated by magic that manifests as a green, smoky glow in their eyes and gaping mouths, keep watch over banks and basilicas, and bloodthirsty vampires lurk in the vaults and crypts below.

#### RAKDOS CREATURES

All sorts of savage, howling beasts accompany Rakdos cultists. Hell hounds, nightmares, and magmins might perform alongside the other entertainers or accompany notable members of the cult as guardians and companions. Rakdos giants, along with ogres draped in hooked chains and spikes, carry and set up tents and stagesand cause utter mayhem when blood lust seizes them.

#### SELESNYA CREATURES

The Selesnya Conclave uses its close connection to nature to enlist a variety of creatures to its cause. These supporters of the conclave take their rightful place in the natural order alongside its more humanlike members.

#### ELEMENTALS

Elementals rise to the guild's defense when the Selesnya Conclave is drawn into conflict. Most of these elementals are made from the roots and branches of trees, making them equivalent to awakened shrubs or awakened trees. Earth elementals incorporate building materials in their forms to serve as armor and weapons.

#### PLANT CREATURES

Many Selesnya buildings, temples, and paths are protected by treants or carnivorous plants, including blights and shambling mounds. Some have vine-like arms that

ensnare prey and drop it into pitcher-like bodies filled with acid. Others are covered with sticky glue that immobilizes and slowly digests the hapless victim.

#### PEGASI

Most often found carrying equenauts in battle, pegasi are ready allies who share the guild's goals and virtues. Members of the guild raise them from infancy, carefully protecting the foals from griffons, drakes, and other aerial predators.

#### SIMIC CREATURES

Simic scientists are interested in the ways that all life forms adapt to their changing environments, but they have a particular fascination with the largest creatures. In a world covered with urban construction, most of these creatures soar above the city or glide deep below it in subterranean oceans accessible only through the Simic zonots.

#### BENTHIDS

Simic scientists use the term "benthid" to refer to the leviathans of the deep. These creatures vary greatly in size and morphology, so they might be represented by the statistics for a giant octopus, plesiosaurus, killer whale, giant shark, dragon turtle, or kraken.

#### MERFOLK

Ravnica's merfolk are unique to the Simic. They emerged from the depths of the plane's long-buried oceans less than a century ago and immediately took on leadership positions in the guild. They claim a deep connection to Ravnica's primal oceans, which are almost untouched by civilization. They have the statistics of the merfolk in the Monster Manual, except that they speak Common and Merfolk, and their legs give them a walking speed of 30 feet.

#### GUILDLESS CREATURES

A monster that doesn't appear on the tables in this section can show up in Ravnica. Other categories of creatures that exist in the world include the following:

- Undercity Denizens. Creatures that don't have clear guild connections, such as carrion crawlers and otyughs, creep and slink through the undercity.
- Undead. Orzhov spirits and Golgari zombies are not the extent of undead in Ravnica. Wherever people die, there's a chance of them returning as revenants, ghosts, or other forms of undead.
- The Guildless. The nonplayer characters presented in the Monster Manual and other sources can represent any of the ordinary citizens of Ravnica, whether they are connected to guilds or not. Commoners go about their daily business, bandits prey on the weak, and cultists lurk in shadowed shrines, either hidden from the guilds or beneath their notice.
- Ordinary Animals. Virtually any of the creatures that appear in appendix A of the Monster Manual could show up in Ravnica. Many such creatures are confined to small greenbelts or the ruined rubblebelts, but others thrive in the urban environment, including birds, scavengers, and sewer dwellers.

# BESTIARY

The following pages feature stat blocks for various creatures of Ravnica, arranged in alphabetical order. For guidance on how to use a creature's stat block, consult the introduction of the Monster Manual.

#### DRAKES

The winged reptiles known as drakes are a common sight in the skies of Ravnica. They soar above the spires and rooftops hunting for aerial prey. Highly trainable, they are favored as pets, servants, and mounts.

The most common drakes, called wind drakes, are about the size of a human and use the statistics of a pteranodon. The smallest drakes are the size of a bird of prey and use the statistics of an eagle; larger ones have the statistics of a giant eagle.

#### PACK BEASTS

You can use stat blocks from the Monster Manual to represent various pack beasts encountered in Ravnica, as indicated in the Pack Beasts table.

Brushstrider. Destructive when confined, brushstriders thrive when they can freely wander garden areas.

Ceratok. A ceratok has two curving horns at the end of its snout.

Dromad. A dromad is similar to a camel, but it lacks a hump.

Indrik. With their long necks, indriks are common sights in the Tenth District. They are ornery creatures; an indrik without a handler to order it around usually goes on a rampage or flees.

Krovod. A krovod is a slow-witted, ox-like animal. Raktusk. A raktusk is a bison-like creature, about 10 feet tall at the shoulder.

# ANGELS

Ravnican angels are physical manifestations of the principles of justice and righteousness. Created in the image of the founder of the Boros Legion, Razia, they originally all served in the legion, but individual angels embody different approaches to ideals of justice, duty, law, and order. This diversity has caused some angels to leave the Boros Legion; they might join other guilds or remain independent, protecting the guildless.

Angels from Ravnica appear similar to human women with two large feathered wings. Present-day angels have the full range of human height, weight, and coloration. Some are crowned or surrounded by a glowing nimbus of light, and others have hair like living flame.

Immortal Nature. Angels don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

#### BOROS ANGELS

Angels of the Boros Legion view themselves as the embodiments of what their creator intended. They are fierce warriors devoted to justice and dedicated to protecting the weak against evil and oppression. They are commanders, advisors, strategists, and soldiers. Their presence in battle inspires the mortal soldiers of the legion with righteous zeal.

Most Boros soldiers assume that angels are paragons of goodness, wisdom, and mercy. The reality is that angels aren't immune to the temptations of corruption, and the necessities of political machination can compromise the best of them.

Warleaders. The wisest, most visionary angels are responsible for forming and implementing the military strategy of the Boros Legion. Since they are immortal, their plans might span centuries, and they have been known to accept decades of losses as a reasonable cost for a more significant victory many years later. These warleaders have the statistics of planetars or solars (as presented in the Monster Manual), but their appearance is similar to other Boros angels.

#### BATTLEFORCE ANGEL

Battleforce angels are the radiant hosts that soar into combat, bathed in the light of Boros zeal. They lead companies of mortal soldiers from above or fly ahead of roc-mounted skyknights. They don't shy away from the blood, pain, and confusion of combat; rather, they immerse themselves in the shifting tides of battle. Only by wading into the battle can they fulfill their responsibility to carry out the commands of the warleaders by adapting their tactics to the shifting situation on the ground.

### BATTLEFORCE ANGEL

Flyby. The angel doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

Magic Resistance. The angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The angel makes two melee attacks. It also uses Battlefield Inspiration.

Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage. If the target is within 5 feet of any of the angel's allies, the target takes an extra 2 (1d4) radiant damage.

Battlefield Inspiration. The angel chooses up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Until the end of the angel's next turn, each target can add a d4 to its attack rolls and saving throws.

### FIREMANE ANGEL

Medium celestial, chaotic good

| Armor Class 18 (plate) |  |  |  |  |  |

Flyby. The angel doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

Innate Spellcasting. The angel's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). The angel can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

3/day each: compelled duel, guiding bolt (as a 5th-level spell) 1/day each: daylight, fireball (as a 6th-level spell)

Magic Resistance. The angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). If the angel takes 21 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The angel makes two melee attacks.

Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) slashing damage, or 11 (1d10 + 6) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 22 (5d8) fire or radiant damage (angel's choice).

#### FIREMANE NEVENA

Chastised by Aurelia after leading a successful assault against a group of guildless rebels, Nevena has distanced herself from the Boros Legion's leadership and independently pursues her own vision of justice and punishment. Nevena's willful independence is a source of tension among the firemanes as well as in the upper echelons of the legion's leadership. How much should a firemane be free to pursue her own agenda, given that her agenda is righteous and just? For now, Aurelia has decided to let Nevena have an unprecedented degree of freedom, but if she betrays any hint of corruption, she will quickly be brought back under close scrutiny.

#### FIREMANE ANGEL

Firemane angels are holy champions and paragons of war who specialize in single combat. They are powerful warriors who seek out the mightiest foes in any conflict, trusting lesser soldiers to handle lesser opponents.

Like many other Boros angels, firemanes typically have red hair. In the heat of battle, a firemane's hair can ignite, transforming into a mane of flames cascading over its shoulders and down its back.

#### ORZHOV ANGELS

Few angels find anything appealing in the corruption and decadence embodied by the Orzhov Syndicate, since such a society is fundamentally antithetical to their natures, but disillusionment can seduce even immortal beings. When cynicism takes root in an angel's heart, when questions undermine devotion to the cause of justice, when strength becomes a tool to lord over the weak, the Orzhov Syndicate is there to welcome the angel with open arms, offering status, respect, and power.

Orzhov angels might claim positions as executioners, commanders, or power brokers, but more often they carve out their own place in the guild, standing apart from the otherwise rigid hierarchy of the Orzhov.

# DEATHPACT ANGEL

Medium celestial, lawful evil

Armor Class 18 (natural armor) Hit Points 175 (27d8 + 54) Speed 30 ft., fly 90 ft.

| STR DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 (+3) 18 (+4) 14 (+2) 19 (+4) 20 (+5) 23 (+6) |  |  |  |  |

Saving Throws Int +9, Wis +10, Cha +11 Skills Insight +10, Intimidation +11, Perception +10, Persuasion +11 Damage Resistances necrotic, radiant; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks Condition Immunities charmed, exhaustion, frightened Senses truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 20 Languages all Challenge 14 (11,500 XP)

Exploitation of the Debtors. As a bonus action, the angel targets a creature charmed by it that it can see within 30 feet of it. The angel deals 11 (2d10) necrotic damage to the target, and the angel gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

Flyby. The angel doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

Innate Spellcasting. The angel's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). The angel can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: command (as a 2nd-level spell), detect evil and good 3/day each: charm person (as a 5th-level spell), darkness, suggestion

1/day: raise dead

Magic Resistance. The angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The angel makes two attacks with its scythe. It can substitute Chains of Obligation for one of these attacks.

Scythe. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage plus 27 (6d8) necrotic damage.

Chains of Obligation. The angel targets one creature charmed by it that it can see within 90 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

#### DEATHPACT ANGEL

Deathpact angels dwell in the grandest of Orzhov cathedrals, where they surround themselves with wealth and wretched vassals that are utterly in their thrall.

Gift Givers. Posing as a beneficent god, a deathpact angel attracts petitioners who beg the angel for blessings: wealth, prestige, health, revenge, and the like. Imagining itself generous and merciful, the angel usually tries to grant the petitioners what they seek by using its abilities, drawing from its hoard of riches, or extorting favors from other members of the guild. True to the spirit of the Orzhov, though, the angel doesn't bestow these gifts out of kindness, but for the sake of gaining fanatical followers who owe it life debts.

Debt and Indenture. Those who receive favors from a deathpact angel incur a debt that they carry with fervent devotion. They regularly bring trinkets and offerings to the angel, no longer asking or expecting anything in return, and even willingly offer up their mortal lives for their angelic patron. Even after death, these debtors continue to serve the angel and the Orzhov Syndicate as indentured spirits (described later in this chapter).

#### DEBTS PAID

A deathpact angel can give an indentured spirit a clause to escape its bound servitude: if the angel ever dies, the indentured spirit can sacrifice its undead existence to restore the angel to life. Upon seeing the angel drop to 0 hit points, an indentured spirit can destroy itself, its debt discharged as it dissipates, after which the angel returns to life with 1 hit point.

# ARCHON OF THE TRIUMVIRATE

Archons are enigmatic, supernatural embodiments of the harshest aspects of law and order. They espouse a rigid sense of justice and deal ruthless punishment to those who break the law. This nature often aligns them with the Azorius Senate, and they are commonly seen circling above the Azorius guildhall astride their winged felidar mounts, soaring alongside griffon-mounted hussars.

An archon appears as an armored humanoid figure, nearly always mounted. Its face is usually shadowed beneath a large hood; those who have seen beneath the hood describe a face of celestial beauty with a stern expression and blank white eyes.

Eternal Riders. The bond between an archon and its winged felidar mount is so close that the two are sometimes considered a single being, acting with a single mind. If an archon is ever thrown from its saddle, it can magically return to its place astride its mount in an instant.

Immortal Nature. An archon doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

#### ARCHON OF THE TRIUMVIRATE Medium celestial, lawful neutral

Armor Class 18 (plate) Hit Points 144 (17d8 + 68) Speed 30 ft.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20 (+5) | 15 (+2) | 19 (+4) | 15 (+2) | 21 (+5) | 18 (+4) |

Saving Throws Con +9, Wis +10, Cha +9

Skills Insight +10, Perception +10

Damage Resistances bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks

Condition Immunities charmed, exhaustion, frightened Senses darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 20 Languages all Challenge 14 (11,500 XP)

Eye of the Law. As a bonus action, the archon can target a creature it can see within 120 feet of it and determine which laws that creature has broken in the last 24 hours.

Innate Spellcasting. The archon's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). The archon can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

#### At will: calm emotions, command, compelled duel

Mount. If the archon isn't mounted, it can use a bonus action to magically teleport onto the creature serving as its mount, provided the archon and its mount are on the same plane of existence. When it teleports, the archon appears astride the mount along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying.

While mounted and not incapacitated, the archon can't be surprised, and both it and its mount gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws. If the archon is reduced to 0 hit points while riding its mount, the mount is reduced to 0 hit points as well.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The archon makes two Hammer of Justice attacks.

Hammer of Justice. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Pacifying Presence. Each creature of the archon's choice that the archon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, or else the target drops any weapons it is holding, ends its concentration on any spells or other effects, and becomes charmed by the archon for 1 minute. The charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the archon's Pacifying Presence for the next 24 hours.

#### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The archon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The archon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

- Rejoin Mount. If the archon isn't mounted, it magically teleports to its steed and mounts it as long as the archon and its steed are on the same plane of existence.
- Smite (Costs 2 Actions). The archon makes a Hammer of Justice attack, and then its mount can use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack.
- Detention (Costs 3 Actions). The archon targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or be magically teleported to a harmless demiplane until the end of the archon's next turn, whereupon the target reappears in the space it left or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

# ARCLIGHT PHOENIX

An arclight phoenix is variously said to be a byproduct of a lightning strike on an aviary, a mishap in an effort to create a translocation device, or a successful attempt to create an elemental creature in the form of a majestic bird.

Whatever its origin, an arclight phoenix looks like a bird of prey formed entirely of electrical energy. Lightning fans out behind it as it bolts from place to place through the sky, making up in speed what it lacks in grace and majesty. It seems happiest during natural thunderstorms, as it darts among the clouds, gliding alongside thunderbolts.

Elemental Nature. An arclight phoenix doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Flyby. The arclight phoenix doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

Grounded Lightning. The first time on a turn that the arclight phoenix touches the ground, it takes 11 (2d10) force damage.

Illumination. The arclight phoenix sheds bright light in a 15foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.

Lightning Form. The arclight phoenix can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the phoenix or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage. In addition, the arclight phoenix can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage.

Crackling Death. When the arclight phoenix dies, it explodes. Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion destroys the phoenix but leaves behind a Tiny, warm egg with a mizzium shell.

The egg contains the embryo of a new arclight phoenix. It hatches when it is in the area of a spell that deals lightning damage, or if a creature touches the egg and expends spell slots whose combined levels equal 13 or more. When it hatches, the egg releases a new arclight phoenix that appears in the egg's space.

#### ACTIONS

Arclight Touch. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (6d8) lightning damage, and lightning jumps from the target to one creature of the phoenix's choice that it can see within 30 feet of the target. That second creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 27 (6d8) lightning damage.

# CONCLAVE DRYAD

The lush forests that once grew on Ravnica are gone, but the dryads remain, striving to bring the sprawling city and the verdant green of nature into harmony. Dryads believe that their efforts are the will of Mat'Selesnya, the soul of the world, and they spread their teachings through every Selesnya enclave.

Thanks to their attunement to Mat'Selesnya, dryads serve as visionaries and spiritual intermediaries for the Selesnya Conclave. They hold positions of great respect as spiritual leaders, and also share their vision of harmonious construction as architects, working with stonemasons and woodshapers to create Selesnya enclaves.

Summoned Mount. When leading its guild into battle, a dryad rides a magically summoned creature woven of living branches, vines, and grasses and imbued with a fey spirit.

Innate Spellcasting. The dryad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). The dryad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

#### At will: druidcraft

3/day each: dispel magic, entangle, plant growth, spike growth 1/day each: moonbeam, grasping vine, wall of thorns

Magic Resistance. The dryad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Speak with Beasts and Plants. The dryad can communicate with beasts and plants as if they and the dryad shared a language.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The dryad makes three attacks, using its vine staff, its longbow, or both.

Vine Staff. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained by twisting vines for 1 minute. A target restrained in this way can use an action to make a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Longbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.

Summon Mount (1/Day). The dryad magically summons a mount, which appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the dryad. The mount remains for 8 hours, until it or the dryad dies, or until the dryad dismisses it as an action. The mount uses the stat block of an elk (see the Monster Manual) with these changes: it is a plant instead of a beast, it has an Intelligence of 6, and it understands Sylvan but can't speak. While within 1 mile of the mount, the dryad can communicate with it telepathically.

Suppress Magic (Recharge 5-6). The dryad targets one magic item it can see within 120 feet of it. If the magic item isn't an artifact, its magical properties are suppressed for 10 minutes, until the dryad is incapacitated or dies, or until the dryad uses a bonus action to end the effect.

### DEMONS

Just as angels are incarnations of the ideals of justice, demons embody depraved impulses: selfishness, cruelty, hatred, greed, and lust for power. Demons are strongly associated with the Cult of Rakdos; in fact, the demons of Ravnica might have been created by Rakdos in the same way that angels were created by the Boros Legion's founder. As a demon lord who has chosen to live in Ravnica, Rakdos claims authority over all the demons of this world-even if some of them, ambitious and headstrong as demons are, rebel against his authority.

Demons are agents of destruction that work their acts of terror in plain sight under the auspices of the Cult of Rakdos. They exhibit their cruelty in dramatic performances that leave the audience members blood-soaked but ecstatic. They incite mob riots that raze entire city blocks. The only thing demons fear is Rakdos himself, who doesn't tolerate rivals and hates to be upstaged.

Demonic "Devils." The creatures called "devils" in Ravnica are minor demons akin to quasits. While the larger demons embody evil qualities such as blood lust and torment, these lesser demons reflect the whimsical and chaotic side of Rakdos and his cult. Their mischievous antics cause disorder and destruction out of proportion to the demons' small size.

Diabolic Demons. Many of the demons of Ravnica are monstrous, winged creatures of human-like form. They are best represented by the statistics of the nalfeshnee, the shadow demon, or the vrock in the Monster Manual. Demons associated with the Cult of Rakdos often have fiery attacks that make them similar to barbed devils or horned devils, except that they are demons. (They are chaotic evil, they speak Abyssal and not Infernal, and they lack Devil's Sight.)

#### CACKLER

Cacklers are small, jabbering jesters that spice up Rakdos performances with their chaotic antics. Their incessant cackling can inspire uncontrollable laughter by making everything-even the most horrifying spectacles-seem hilarious. Some cacklers excel at vocal mimicry and perform as impressionists; others put their sadistic bent to use by lurking in shadows and terrifying passersby. Rakdos performers enjoy dressing cacklers in a variety of masks, hats, and costumes to lampoon public figures.

At will: fire bolt 1/day: Tasha's hideous laughter

Last Laugh. When the cackler dies, it releases a dying laugh that scars the minds of other nearby creatures. Each creature within 10 feet of the cackler must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or take 2 (1d4) psychic damage.

Mimicry. The cackler can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 11 Wisdom (Insight) check.

Challenge 9 (5,000 XP)

Aura of Blood Lust. When any other creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the master, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, or it must immediately take the Attack action, making one melee attack against a random creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, it makes a ranged attack against a random creature within range, throwing its weapon if necessary.

Feed on the Crowd. Whenever a creature within 60 feet of the master dies, the master gains 15 temporary hit points and has advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the end of its next turn.

Innate Spellcasting. The master's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). The master can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: charm person (as a 3rd-level spell), crown of madness 1/day: dominate person

Magic Resistance. The master has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The master makes two melee attacks with its spear.

Spear. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 13 (3d8) psychic damage.

Captivating Presence (Recharge 6). Each creature within 120 feet of the master must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the master for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, a creature's speed is 0. If the charmed creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Captivating Presence of all masters of cruelties for the next 24 hours.

### MASTER OF CRUELTIES

When a master of cruelties steps up as ringleader of a Rakdos show, the audience can be assured of a performance they will remember for the rest of their liveshowever brief that might be.

The mesmerizing presence of a master of cruelties draws every eye to the demon and commands an audience's full attention. With every act of depraved torment the demon performs, onlookers are drawn more and more into the blood lust. Audiences clamor for more violence, and those who get too caught up in the revelry feel compelled to partake in the indiscriminate killing.

Aura of Mind Erosion. Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the sire must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this aura for the next 24 hours.

At the start of each of its turns, the sire can suppress this aura until the start of its next turn.

Innate Spellcasting. The sire's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). The sire can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) psychic damage.

#### SIRE OF INSANITY

Rakdos nightclubs, where visitors can indulge any dark desire and revel in sadistic spectacle, are the favored haunts of the demons known as sires of insanity. Lurking in an underground vault beneath a Rakdos operation, a sire of insanity feasts on the violence, torment, and depravity unfolding above. Occasionally, cultists bring would-be recruits to the demon's presence, andtrue to its name-the sire of insanity breaks the new cultist's mind.

A sire of insanity is a bloated demon resembling a bipedal lizard. It stands some thirty feet tall and weighs many thousands of pounds, so it tends to keep hidden away in its subterranean lair, working its evil from the shadows.

# DEVKARIN LICH

Powerful spellcasters of the Devkarin elves, steeped in Golgari magic, can transcend death to become liches. For them, life and death don't merely chase each other in an inevitable cycle; the two can intersect, and at that nexus the liches find immense power, which commands the awe, envy, and fear of other Golgari.

Unlike the shambling zombies they command, liches retain their memories, their personalities, and especially their ambition. They also retain the grace and stature of living elves, but their bodies are in a constant state of slow decay. Various forms of fungus grow in and over the rotting flesh to hold the body together.

Undead Nature. The lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

#### STORREV

Storrev is a lich and a leader of the Erstwhile. She is adept at the politics of court, and she is feared for her power to transform dead monsters, from ordinary beetles to the mightiest wurms, into fierce undead horrors. Such creatures accompany her into battle.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Regeneration. The lich regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the lich takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the lich's next turn. The lich dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

#### ACTIONS

Noxious Touch. Melee Spell Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (4d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute.

# FELIDAR

A felidar is a celestial creature whose nature reflects an inherent devotion to law and order. It resembles an enormous cat with two pairs of downward-sloping horns and prominent teeth. Its blue-gray hide has a silvery, geometric pattern, and its thick white mane falls in an orderly fashion around its shoulders.

Nearly every felidar forms a close bond with one other creature. Winged felidars almost always bond with archons, joining in their relentless pursuit of justice. Other felidars ally with members of the Azorius Senate and form bonds with high-ranking justiciars and ministers, aiding them in enforcing the law and tracking down criminals. Some Azorius felidars form bonds with important prisoners in Azorius custody, ensuring that the felidars can track down the felons if they escape custody.

#### WINGED FELIDARS

Some felidars boast huge, feathered wings. A winged felidar uses the same stat block as an ordinary felidar, with the addition of a flying speed of 40 feet.

Bonding. The felidar can magically bond with one creature it can see, right after spending at least 1 hour observing that creature while within 30 feet of it. The bond lasts until the felidar bonds with a different creature or until the bonded creature dies. This bond has the following effects:

- The felidar and the bonded creature can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to 100 feet.
- . The felidar can sense the direction and distance to the bonded creature if they're on the same plane of existence.
- · As an action, the felidar or the bonded creature can sense what the other sees and hears, during which time it loses its own sight and hearing. This effect lasts until the start of its next turn.

Keen Hearing and Sight. The felidar has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.

Pounce. If the felidar moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the felidar can make one claw attack against it as a bonus action.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The felidar makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage.

Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage.

# GIANTS

Giants use their tremendous size and strength to advance the cause of no less than four guilds. In the Boros Legion and the Orzhov Syndicate, they are cunning soldiers. The giants of the Cult of Rakdos and the Gruul Clans are no less effective but lack discipline.

### BLOODFRAY GIANT

Giants in the Cult of Rakdos act as enforcers, bouncers, and sometimes even pillars, holding the mobile platforms that serve as stages for Rakdos performances. Like other members of the cult, giants thrill to the violence of those shows. Though they can seem entranced by the horror unfolding on the stage, they react quickly and brutally to any interruption of the performance.

### GUARDIAN GIANT

Most of the giants in the Boros Legion come from a single clan, the Skorskal, that has long been at odds with the Gruul Clans. These giants are guards and gatekeepers, well represented in the Sunhome Guard, as well as powerful muscle supporting Boros missions.

Giants of the Skorskal clan are often assigned to protect Boros garrisons and forts throughout Ravnica. They are excellent sentinels, keen-eved and vigilant, and serve as living walls to protect smaller soldiers fighting alongside them. Skorskal giants look much like enormous humans with huge muscles and comparatively small heads.

Rock. Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

#### REACTIONS

Furious Defense. After a creature the giant can see is dealt damage by a foe within 20 feet of the giant, the giant makes a chain attack against that foe.

|
|  |

A few giants join the ranks of the Orzhov Syndicate and serve as guards, executioners, and thugs-the muscle of the guild. The presence of Orzhov giants in markets and streets serves as an effective reminder for business owners to keep their payments up to date.

#### SUNDER SHAMAN

Gruul sunder shamans are angry giants that channel their rage into brutal attacks that deal overwhelming damage to foes and structures alike.

These shamans sometimes lead hill giants and stone giants that also live among the Gruul Clans. They are occasionally joined by cyclopes, ettins, fomorians, and ogres. Like the rest of the Gruul, they hate the urban development that encroaches on the wilds where they once lived-not least because they have so much difficulty fitting inside the small structures. They delight in destroying such edifices, and in the heat of their rage, they walk through buildings, trample people underfoot, and generally cause as much chaos as possible. They often armor themselves with pieces of buildings and wield columns or other architectural elements as clubs.

# HORRORS

Terrifying evils stalk, fly, and scuttle in the dark corners of Ravnica, from the depths of the undercity to the blackest parts of the night sky. Collectively, these creatures are called horrors-a variety of things that lurk in the dark and embody the deepest fears of Ravnica's people. All are evil creatures with dim reason and preternatural cunning.

At least three guilds have been known to compel horrors into service. For House Dimir, horrors spread fear and despair in the citizenry and carry out assassinations or kidnappings against well-protected targets. For the Cult of Rakdos, horrors are simply one more weapon in an arsenal of terrifying and shock-inspiring creatures that might appear on stage. For the Golgari Swarm, horrors scavenge the sewers and protect the guild's territory.

House Dimir uses all three base kinds of horrors. The Cult of Rakdos prefers shadow horrors, and the Golgari Swarm uses skittering horrors.

### HORRORS AND MADNESS

Horrors on Ravnica are terror and madness personified. You can represent this reality by using the madness rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Whenever a character fails a saving throw against the flying horror's Frightening Screech, the shadow horror's claw attack, or the skittering horror's Maddening Presence, note that fact. At the end of the encounter, have each character who failed at least one of those saving throws make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, nothing happens. On a failed save, a character gains a form of madness from the Dungeon Master's Guide, with the severity depending on how many of the saving throws that character failed during the encounter, as shown on the Madness Severity table.

The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the horror's Frightening Screech for the next 24 hours.

### CUSTOMIZING A HORROR

Horrors share some common body types but vary wildly in other characteristics. A particular horror's form might incorporate elements that resemble fiendish. insectile, or reptilian features. To customize a horror. choose a base creature (flying horror, shadow horror, or skittering horror), then roll once on the Primary Features table and once on the Secondary Features table (or choose an option from each table). Add those features to the base creature.

#### PRIMARY FEATURES

#### d4 Feature

- l Avoidance. If the horror is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
- 2 Damage Resistances. The horror has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage.
- 3 Innate Spellcasting. The horror's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13 for flying horror, DC 16 for shadow horror, and DC 17 for skittering horror). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

#### 3/day: darkness

1/day each: fear (shadow horror and skittering horror only), phantasmal killer (skittering horror only)

- Psychic Rebuke. When the horror takes damage from A a melee attack, it can use its reaction to emit psychic energy within a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area takes 3 (1d6) psychic damage (flying horror), 7 (2d6) psychic damage (shadow horror), or 10 (3d6) psychic damage (skittering horror)
#### SECONDARY FEATURES

#### d4 Feature

- l Grasping Tendrils. The horror has four tendrils. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 12, 10 hit points). Destroying one deals no damage to the horror.
As a bonus action, the horror can target one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be grappled by the horror. The DC of the saving throw and the DC to escape the grapple are the same: 9 for the flying horror, 13 for the shadow horror, and 19 for the skittering horror. Until the grapple ends, the horror can't use the same tendril to grapple another target.

- Indomitable Mind. The horror is immune to the 2 charmed condition.
- 3 Keen Senses. The horror has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, sound, or smell.
- 4 Mind Sight. Magical darkness doesn't impede the horror's darkvision.

# INDENTURED SPIRIT

Those who die with unpaid debts to the Orzhov Syndicate don't get a reprieve. Instead, their spirits serve the syndicate until they have worked off their obligation. Sometimes that means existing as an indentured spirit for years or even millennia.

An indentured spirit is an incorporeal being draped in ghostly black robes and a hood that hides whatever face it might have. Chains are hung around its chest and arms as a perpetual marker of its servitude.

#### ORZHOV SPIRITS

For the members of the Orzhov Syndicate, life as a spirit after death can be a gift, or it can mean everlasting servitude. The process of separating the soul from the body is often willingly undergone by the heads of the oldest and most respected families of the Orzhov oligarchy, resulting in pampered spirits that think they can spend the rest of eternity enjoying the spoils of their decadence. These spirits begin their undead existence as ghosts and use the ghost stat block in the Monster Manual. Over time, however, they tend to shed the nuances of their personalities and become caricatures of their living selves, often turning into specters, as described in the Monster Manual.

# IZZET WEIRDS

Weirds are the products of Izzet League experiments intended to combine two opposing elemental types in the hope of creating elementals that were more stable than the norm and easier to control. As commonly happens with Izzet experiments, the outcome was the exact opposite. Weirds are even wilder and more unpredictable than elementals of either of their component elements. Nevertheless, they can make potent guardian creatures and can be urged into fighting on behalf of their creators.

Elemental Nature. An Izzet weird doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

#### BLISTERCOIL WEIRD

A blistercoil weird is an anthropomorphic brute formed from water and molten rock. It absorbs energy from magical fire, causing its oozelike body to increase in size. During one disastrous experiment, Izzet researchers observed a blistercoil weird expanding to fill a sixstory workshop before it released all its excess energy in an enormous explosion and returned to its original size.

the weird must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. The weird's size then becomes Medium.

Form of Fire and Water. The weird can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In addition, the weird can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time the weird enters another creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the burning creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

Heated Body. A creature that touches the weird or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (Id10) fire damage.

Illumination. The weird sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

#### ACTIONS

If there isn't enough room for the weird to increase in size, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available. While the weird is Large or bigger, it makes Strength checks and saving throws with advantage.

If the weird starts its turn at Gargantuan size, the weird releases energy in an explosion. Each creature within 30 feet of

Amplify Lightning. Whenever a spell that deals lightning damage includes one or more fluxchargers in its area, the spell deals an extra 9 (2d8) lightning damage.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The fluxcharger makes two slam attacks or uses Arc Lightning twice.

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage.

Arc Lightning. Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) lightning damage, and lightning jumps from the target to one creature of the fluxcharger's choice that it can see within 30 feet of the target. That second creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) lightning damage. Hit or Miss: The fluxcharger takes 5 (1d10) force damage after resolving the attack.

#### FLUXCHARGER

In an effort to create a weird that could be more easily controlled, Izzet mages tried binding elemental lightning, fire, and smoke into a framework made of the magical alloy mizzium. The experiment was partly successful: the resulting weird, a fluxcharger, doesn't explode like some other weirds do, but it is more intelligent and more headstrong than other weirds.

A fluxcharger's mizzium frame is suggestive of an angel. A faceplate is meant to give it some personality, but most people find its solemn expression and unblinking stare more unnerving than relatable.

Death Burst. When the galvanice weird dies, it explodes in a burst of ice and lightning. Each creature within 10 feet of the exploding weird must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### ACTIONS

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or lose the ability to use reactions until the start of the weird's next turn.

#### GALVANICE WEIRD

Galvanice weirds seem to be the epitome of weird technology. Indeed, they serve willingly, with cheerful stupidity, as guardians and laborers in Izzet workshops. They combine a rigid body of elemental ice with a core of lightning that animates them. If a galvanice weird is destroyed, the ice shatters and lightning crackles outward in a dangerous explosion. Still, most Izzet researchers find that their usefulness outweighs this risk.

# KRASIS

In the deep sinkholes that serve as laboratories and guildhalls for the Simic Combine, biomancers employ a combination of magic and scientific method to create novel life forms. They coax new morphologies from existing creatures or combine traits from multiple organisms into one, producing the creatures known as krasis. Some krasis are unique creatures that can't reproduce. A few multiply and become part of the guild's standard menagerie.

### CREATING A KRASIS

To create a krasis, choose the appropriate stat block: category 1 (Medium), category 2 (Large), or category 3 (Huge). Then roll once on the Major Adaptations table and once on the Minor Adaptations table (or choose an option from each table) to determine its additional characteristics. The potency of some adaptations varies based on the category of the krasis, as indicated in the descriptions of those adaptations.

Just a few examples of krasis are the battering krasis (a fusion of hammerhead shark and a powerfully built beast), the crocanura (a crocodile-frog), the drakewing krasis (a lizard-drake), the teratosuchus (a crocodile-crab), the shambleshark (a shark-crab), and the sharktocrab (an improved shambleshark that includes octopus elements as well).

#### MAJOR ADAPTATIONS

The ink cloud is stationary and fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the krasis's space before it moves. The sphere is heavily obscured until the ink disperses after 1 minute. A strong current also disperses the ink cloud.
- 7 Leaping Legs. With or without a running start, the krasis's long jump is 20 feet (category 1), 30 feet (category 2), or 40 feet (category 3). Its high jump is 10 feet (category 1), 20 feet (category 2), or 30 feet (category 3).

# KRAUL

The kraul are an ascendant power group within the Golgari Swarm, long content to linger at the margins of the undercity but now increasingly making their buzzing voices heard in the subterranean Golgari guildhall. These six-legged, insectile beings are hard-headed and literal-minded, with little grasp of metaphor or nuance.

### KRAUL WARRIOR

Kraul society is organized into well-defined roles and castes. The vast majority of the kraul occupy various tiers of soldiery, from commanders and elite troops down to the lowliest infantry.

### KRAUL DEATH PRIEST

The death priests occupy the highest roles in kraul society. They lead the buzzing chants of the kraul rites. Their inscrutable clicks and buzzing can summon crippling necromantic magic, and the presence of death seems to fortify them. They draw power from the defeat of their enemies and channel it to their followers, ensuring the continuation of the cycle.

The current leader of the kraul is a death priest named Mazirek.

#### WINGED KRAUL WARRIORS

Some kraul warriors have a flying speed of 40 feet, as a result of possessing gossamer wings. Their wings give them a higher station among the kraul soldiers. Winged kraul warriors serve the guild as scouts and shock troops.

# NIGHTVEIL SPECTER

The Nightveil specters of Ravnica are hooded, undead guardians that ride flying creatures called gloamwings. They are fearsome agents of House Dimir, protecting the territory and interests of that guild-particularly the neighborhood of Nightveil, from which the specters get their name. Their work can include driving off people who accidentally wander too close to a secret rooftop meeting, killing those who knowingly infiltrate Dimir property, and tracking those who have stolen guild secrets, then wiping those secrets from their victims' minds to ensure that they are never shared.

Limited Sentience. A Nightveil specter is created when the mind magic of House Dimir erases a person's identity, leaving a mind so broken it can no longer live. Thus, Nightveil specters have no memory of their previous lives, and they are just clever enough to follow their orders with some amount of creativity. They pursue their assigned tasks with fearless determination.

Gloamwing Mount. If a gloamwing is killed, its specter becomes fixated on destroying those responsible. If the specter survives, it can create a new gloamwing over the course of a month, during which time the specter is incapacitated.

A gloamwing's head is almost ratlike, with prominent teeth, and its leathery skin is stretched tight over its skull, where its eyes are empty sockets. Its body is mottled with bony plates, and great wings stretch from its shoulders.

Undead Nature. A Nightveil specter and its gloamwing mount don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

# NIVIX CYCLOPS

Cyclopes like those described in the Monster Manual are found primarily among the Gruul Clans. They are forces of nature, and even though they have occasionally been recruited into the Boros Legion, they can never truly be tamed.

Cyclopes serve the Izzet league as workshop guardians, personal protectors, and heavy laborers. They wear mizzium armor plating to minimize injuries from laboratory mishaps, piston gauntlets to increase their strength for lifting and punching, and telescopic helmets to minimize the shortcomings of their monocular vision. They are sometimes called monoclons or Nivix cyclopes, after the name of the Izzet guildhall.

# SIMIC HYBRIDS

The Guardian Project is a consequence of increasing tension within the Simic Combine as the threat of interguild conflict looms. Believing that the Simic must be prepared to fight for their lives when that conflict comes to a head, biomancers have created soldiers to help defend the guild. These hybrids (also called guardians, after the name of the project) are created from human, vedalken, and elf guild members who volunteer to be transformed.

# SKYJEK ROC

The aerial forces of the Boros Legion-skyknights who fly alongside the angels-take to the air mounted on Skyjek rocs. These avians are named for the skyknights who are also part of the Wojek League, called Skyjeks. From the backs of their rocs, these mounted soldiers carry out reconnaissance missions, bombard enemies on the ground, and engage flying foes.

The shape of a Skyjek roc's body makes it relatively easy to saddle and ride, and it is typically equipped with armor plating on its head and chest.

Skyjek rocs are headstrong and impulsive, but their bravery makes them ideal mounts for the Boros knights.

A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the skyswimmer, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the skyswimmer's turns.

If the skyswimmer takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the skyswimmer must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the skyswimmer. If the skyswimmer dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d12 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

WINGED THRUL

# THRULLS

When the Orzhov Syndicate rips a soul from its body to create a spirit, the cast-off remains go to the fleshmages, who use their necromantic magic to liquefy the corpse and transform it into something useful. These creations become thrulls, obedient slaves that serve in a variety of menial roles: laborers, messengers, beasts of burden, and even fashion accessories for the elite. Whatever tasks they perform, they wear faceplates forged from devalued coinage to conceal their ghastly features.

Construct Nature. A thrull doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### SERVITOR THRULL

The most wretched of thrulls are the servitors, small and slender, that serve as playthings for their Orzhov masters. They run trivial errands, transport small items, caper and dance, and keep their masters' expensive robes from trailing on the dirty street. They are utterly loyal, lacking any concept of thinking for themselves.

### WINGED THRULL

Winged thrulls are at once the most intelligent of Orzhov thrulls (which isn't saying much), as well as the smallest, most unobtrusive, and most mobile. They act as messengers and spies for their Orzhov masters and tend to mimic the mannerisms and movements of the oligarchs they serve.

# UNDERCITY MEDUSA

The medusas of Ravnica, often called gorgons, are a monstrous race of creatures that appear superficially similar to human women. In place of hair, a gorgon has a writhing mass of black, serpentine cables, and its hands are scaly claws.

The gaze of a medusa's glowing eyes causes living tissue to petrify. The transformation is rapid, leaving the victim as a stone statue, usually frozen in a position of abject fear or agony-a fine trophy for the medusa's macabre collection. The medusa must exert its will to effect this transformation, so the gaze of a surprised or friendly Ravnican medusa is harmless.

This deadly gaze attack gives medusas a degree of power among the Golgari that is out of proportion with their small numbers. Medusas command a significant share of the guild's smaller cells around Ravnica, and at least one medusa is thought to be angling for control of the entire guild at the moment.

Not all gorgons are so ambitious; some prefer to simply stalk the endless shadows of the undercity like hungry predators.

#### LUDMILLA, THE TUNNEL VIPER

Ludmilla is the last surviving member of the Sisters of Stone Death, the trio of power-hungry medusas who slew Svogthir, the original guildmaster of the Golgari Swarm. Ludmilla no longer has the collective power of her medusa sisters, so she's been forced to lurk in Ravnica's undercity, surrounded by hundreds of her petrified victims. She dreams of one day reclaiming control of the Golgari Swarm, or at least causing pain to its current guildmaster, Jarad Vod Savo (whose own sister displaced the medusas from their position).

Surprise Attack. During the first round of combat, the medusa has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that is surprised, and it deals an extra 10 (3d6) damage each time it hits such a creature with an attack.

#### ACTIONS

Multiattack. The medusa makes two claw attacks. It can also use Petrifying Gaze before or after making these attacks.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

Petrifying Gaze. The medusa fixes its gaze on one creature within 60 feet of it that it can see and that can see its eyes. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by a greater restoration spell or similar magic.

VAMPIRE WITH A GARGOYLE

### VAMPIRES

Creatures of the night, vampires are ageless undead beings who subsist on the blood of the living. They are fierce predators who mask their ravenous thirst behind a facade of sophistication and sensuality. Those who sip blood from golden chalices are no less voracious than those who tear out their victims' throats with their fangs; they just hide it better.

The vampires of Ravnica differ from those in the Monster Manual in important ways. They lack the traits and abilities that those other vampires boast, but also lack the weaknesses that hinder such vampires. What they have in common is an unquenchable thirst for the blood that sustains their undead existence.

### BLOOD DRINKER VAMPIRE

Plenty of blood drinkers haunt Ravnica's alleys and sewers, preying on those who are foolish enough to leave the relative safety of the crowds.

Orzhov Vampires. Vampires thrive in the Orzhov Syndicate, where they can collect tithes and payments from their debtors in the form of blood. Their undead nature gives them the same immortality enjoyed by the oligarch spirits, but they remain capable of experiencing all the delights of their corporeal forms. In contrast to Orzhov spirits, they also retain their personalities, which are almost uniformly cruel.

Blood Bond. Consuming a creature's blood creates a sort of empathic bond that allows the blood drinker vampire to exert some magical influence over its victim.

Multiattack. The vampire makes three melee attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the vampire for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the target is infatuated with the vampire.

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

Rapier. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.

Unarmed Strike. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage. The vampire can also grapple the target (escape DC 14) if it is a creature and the vampire has a hand free.

#### REACTIONS

Shadow Stealth. While in dim light or darkness, the vampire can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the vampire has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

#### ACTIONS

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

Unarmed Strike. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The vampire can also grapple the target (escape DC 13) if it is a creature and the vampire has a hand free.

Mind Siphon (Recharge 5-6). The vampire targets a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw, with disadvantage if the vampire has previously consumed the target's blood. On a failed save, the target takes 28 (8d6) psychic damage, and the vampire discerns the target's surface emotions and thoughts. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the vampire discerns the target's general emotional state but not its thoughts.

### MIND DRINKER VAMPIRE

When vampires join House Dimir, they can learn to siphon mental energy and memories along with the blood of their victims. They also study the magic favored by Dimir mind mages, giving them a powerful combination of abilities ideal for espionage and infiltration.

Szadek's Heirs. The founder of House Dimir, Szadek, was the first of the so-called mind drinkers. His secrets are passed on only to other members of his guild, and mind drinkers who leave House Dimir become enemies of the guild-the only exceptions to a rule that prohibits mind drinkers from feeding on others of their kind.

Cell Leaders. Thanks to their particular gifts, mind drinkers are often placed as leaders of small cells of covert Dimir operatives. They rarely trust their own agents, though, and often follow their cell members to make sure those members carry out missions as ordered. The most suspicious vampires might even siphon thoughts from their subordinates to detect any hint of betrayal.

### WURM

Wurms are huge creatures that resemble limbless, wingless dragons. They burrow through the earth and eat virtually anything they come across, and their movement accounts for much of the destruction in the rubblebelt regions of Ravnica.

A wurm burrows through loose earth by using deep sonic vibrations to liquefy the earth in front of it and swim through the area. The soil resolidifies and closes behind it. Moving through rock is slower and more difficult, and the wurm leaves a tunnel in its wake.

The Gruul Clans appreciate the devastation wurms can create, and the clans sometimes lure them into civilized areas where the destruction can be vast.

Challenge 14 (11,500 XP)

Earth Tremors. The wurm creates earth tremors as it moves overland or underground. Any creature that comes within 30 feet of the moving wurm for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Any structure or object anchored to the ground that comes within 30 feet of the moving wurm for the first time on a turn takes 10 (3d6) force damage.

Siege Monster. The wurm deals double damage to objects and structures.

Tunneler. The wurm can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

#### ACTIONS

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (5d6 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the wurm. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the wurm, and takes 17 (5d6) acid damage at the start of each of the wurm's turns.

If the wurm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the wurm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the wurm. If the wurm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

# NPCs BY GUILD

This section describes various nonplayer characters that belong to each guild. These characters can serve as enemies, rivals, allies, or contacts. In addition to the NPCs presented here, you can customize the NPCs in the Monster Manual and other sources to make them feel like part of a particular guild.

Also included in this chapter are statistics and descriptions of the guildmasters of Ravnica. Without exception, these are powerful creatures. In most campaigns, the guildmasters will come into play more often in negotiations and other social settings than in combat. Thus, each guildmaster's ideals, bonds, and flaws are included. As a general rule, a guildmaster's personal agenda is in line with the guild's goals described in chapter 2, so the guild entries there provide additional direction for roleplaying these individuals.

Several other named guild members are highlighted in sidebars.

#### SOLDIER

Soldiers are found in many of Ravnica's guilds. The soldier stat block represents a typical member of the rank and file, though weaponry and armor can vary.

| SOLDIER |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment |  |  |  |  |  |

Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage, or 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage if used with two hands.

#### LAVINIA, STEWARD OF THE GUILDPACT

Arrester Lavinia, an Azorius arrester (use the veteran stat block in the Monster Manual), is straightforward and stern. To her, justice is a bird you have to catch, not a dog that willingly walks toward its master. She worked alongside Jace, the Living Guildpact, scheduling appointments and relaying messages. The work was beneath her, but Lavinia's allegiance was to the soul of her city. Jace's disappearance worries her, but she has steadfastly refused to violate the law of the land by stepping into his duties.

# AZORIUS NPCS

The Azorius Senate's activities focus on maintaining public order. For example, the Lyev Column acts as the police force for all of Ravnica. The Azorius NPCs table summarizes key roles within this force. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the Monster Manual unless the table states otherwise.

#### AZORIUS NPCs

### SUPREME JUDGE ISPERIA

Isperia is the current guildmaster of the Azorius Senate. As a sphinx, she is aloof and values solitude above all. However, she has been forced to give up her privacy to deal with the increased crime and chaos on Ravnica.

Isperia is devoted to her guild's belief that law is the ultimate bulwark against chaos, and it is her steady hand that guides the Azorius through these uncertain times. As guildmaster, Isperia serves as the supreme judge, a role that takes advantage of her encyclopedic knowledge of Ravnica's labyrinthine legal system.

If an encounter turns violent, Isperia refrains from using lethal force if possible, preferring to subdue a wrongdoing so that the legal system can mete out justice.

#### ISPERIA'S TRAITS

Ideal: "The law provides direction for every arena of life; it is the only compass I need."

- Bond: "I can't stand by and watch disorder spread through the city. Without the Azorius, Ravnica would collapse. In the absence of order, we must establish it.'
- Flaw: "If Ravnica didn't need me, I would prefer to live a life of solitude and contemplation."

#### LAWMAGE

The Azorius Senate has spellcasters who are trained to capture lawbreakers and bring them to justice. A lawmage's magic is focused on restraining criminals and on protecting bystanders from becoming casualties when arresters are pursuing malefactors. A significant proportion of the guild's vedalken are lawmages.

#### PRECOGNITIVE MAGE

Precognitive mages, a rarity among Azorius spellcasters, are capable of capturing glimpses of the future. They are typically employed to anticipate the actions of wanted criminals, thus aiding in their capture.

The affected target can't take that action for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can end the effect on itself with a successful DC 23 Intelligence saving throw. A target that succeeds on the saving throw becomes immune to Isperia's Supreme Legal Authority for 24 hours.

Geetra is a precognitive mage who first put her gifts to use as a young thief on the streets of Ravnica. While still a teenager, she was apprehended and then pardoned in exchange for agreeing to use her talents in the service of the Azorius Senate. For decades, she worked in almost complete anonymity, her gifts unappreciated. But with the senate displaying an increased interest in the talents of precognitive mages, Geetra has been given a more prominent position, which she has embraced with enthusiasm. She worries about the impact that her guild has on the rest of Ravnica but believes in her heart that she is helping the people. Chaos can only destroy, and her visions are a tool to ensure that society can live in safety in all variants of the future.

*Appears in this chapter

#### WARLEADER AURELIA

The angel Aurelia leads the Boros Legion. During the years of her leadership, she has shown a strong appreciation for the ordinary citizens who are often caught in the middle of interguild violence.

True justice, Aurelia argues, isn't merely the enforcement of the letter of existing laws (let the Azorius fret over that), but the establishment of equitable and compassionate relationships among all of Ravnica's people. That means protecting the weak from the depredations of the strong, sheltering the innocents who are threatened by war, and ensuring that enforcement of the law doesn't become oppressive. Aurelia actively supports efforts to establish a lasting peace among the guilds in the absence of the Guildpact.

Aurelia prefers to lead the Boros Legion from the front. She brings swift and unrelenting punishment to the wicked, and her temper is legendary.

Immortal Nature. Aurelia doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

#### AURELIA'S TRAITS

- Ideal: "Justice. We must do whatever it takes to establish fair and merciful relationships among Ravnica's people-through force of arms when necessary."
Bond: "The entire legion obeys my commands, and I am therefore beholden to every one of my soldiers."

- Flaw: "I charge into battle with little heed for my own wellbeing."
### FIREFIST

Boros firefists combine potent magic with peerless fighting ability, inspiring all who serve alongside them. They often act as the point of contact between the Boros Legion and the angelic leaders.

#### FRONTLINE MEDIC

The soldiers of the Boros Legion depend on skilled healers to keep them on their feet. Frontline medics use a mix of magical healing and mundane medicine to keep their compatriots alive.

#### RECKONER

Boros reckoners combine physical power and magical prowess, serving as the shock troops of the legion. Thev are adept at breaking up mobs and organized lines of defense. Sometimes described as living thunderstorms, reckoners charge their bodies with lightning that bursts forth in their spells and lashes out at enemies who harm them. Many reckoners are minotaurs.

### LAZAV THE FACELESS

Lazav is uniquely qualified to be the Dimir guildmaster: he is a shapechanger whose mysterious genius is informed by agents from the entire Dimir network. He takes on a tremendous variety of guises as his needs and plans require. He might step out into the Ravnican streets as an elderly widow to eavesdrop at the bazaar, become a vedalken hussar of the Azorius Senate to sidestep a checkpoint, or transform into a Tin Street

Bond: "When the time is right and my plans have come to fruition, all of Ravnica will be mine." Flaw: "I can't trust anyone."

### MIND MAGE

Dimir mind mages are among the most feared spellcasters in Ravnica, thanks in large part to the aura of mystery that shrouds them and their work. Their ability to read and alter memories commands respect from the other members of House Dimir and makes them useful in the full spectrum of the guild's activities. Many mind mages lead cells of their own.

### THOUGHT SPY

Thought spies form the backbone of House Dimir's covert operations. They are trained in stealth and infiltration, tactics that they supplement with rigorously developed mental abilities. To ensure that no secrets slip through Dimir's fingers, they infiltrate rival guilds. In addition to traditional means of gathering intelligence, thought spies use their magic to spy on the thoughts of their targets.

# GOLGARI NPCS

In its embrace of death and its claim over fetid, rotting environments, the Golgari Swarm appeals to those who are comfortable in a world of fungus, rot, and monsters.

Every member of the Golgari Swarm has a function, working together like the parts of a single, larger organism. At the same time, internal factions vie for authority. The most prominent faction is the Devkarin elves, whose spiritual leader, Izoni, is no friend of the guildmaster, Jarad. The medusas are still struggling to coalesce as a faction. The kraul are slowly gaining more influence in the guild under the leadership of the death priest, Mazirek. These faction leaders can serve as patrons for Golgari characters. They might send characters on missions to interfere with a rival or to increase the power and influence of their own faction. They can also serve as major adversaries for adventurers who oppose the Golgari Swarm.

Golgari NPCs include reclaimers, who scavenge and recycle corpses and other detritus, and assassins, who belong to a secret society called the Ochran. The Golgari NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the Monster Manual unless the table states otherwise.

### JARAD VOD SAVO

The Golgari guildmaster is a Devkarin necromancer and lich named Jarad Vod Savo. In life, Jarad was an archer and accomplished hunter, as well as the brother of the previous guildmaster, the ambitious Savra. Jarad mastered the ways of necromancy so he could rise as a lich after he sacrificed himself to save his son from the demon Rakdos.

As head of the Golgari Swarm, Jarad commands elf and medusa assassins, legions of kraul, brutish trolls, and masses of undercity-dwelling creatures. Thanks to the necromantic power he wields-and with the support of his loyal guards and soldiers-he has survived a number of assassination attempts from various upstarts.

Undead Nature. Jarad doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

#### JARAD'S TRAITS

Ideal: "Death. There's wisdom to be gained in it, whether it be your own or someone else's."

Bond: "Ravnica, with all its structures and institutions, will eventually rot away, and it will be time for the Golgari to bloom from the carcass."

Flaw: "I am beyond life and death and can't be harmed."

#### IZONI, DEVKARIN MATKA

The spiritual leader of the Devkarin elves holds the position of matka. Izoni, a Golgari shaman, has recently risen to her position after the suspicious death of her predecessor, Zdenia. Izoni is known for her ability to control insects and spiders, and she is never encountered without the company of one or more swarms of insects crawling over and around her. When she walks, she appears to glide over the ground.

### GOLGARI SHAMAN

Golgari shamans are the spiritual leaders of the Golgari Swarm. They teach the guild's beliefs about the cycles of nature, using their necromantic magic to show how life sprouts from death.

Golgari shamans paint their faces so they appear to have extra eyes on their cheeks and chins. They sometimes use magical moodmark paint (described in chapter 5) to allow them to communicate by means of these marks. They wear clothing adorned with beetle carapaces, spiderwebs, or shelf fungus.

### GOLGARI LAIRS

Members of the Golgari Swarm have an intimate connection to their territory. When at least six Golgari defend their territory together, they can call on the environment to aid them. The group must include Jarad Vod Savo or at least one Golgari shaman, kraul death priest, undercity medusa, or Devkarin lich. When determining the difficulty of such an encounter, consider the lair to be one additional creature of challenge rating 1.

#### LAIR ACTIONS

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Golgari group takes a lair action, causing one of the following effects; the Golgari can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- . If the Golgari can see any sewer openings, they can cause sewage to overflow. Any creature within 20 feet of such an opening must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed up to 20 feet in a straight line away from the opening.
- Spore-laden fungi release a cloud that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the Golgari choose within 120 feet of any member of the group. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until one of the Golgari dismisses it as an action, the Golgari group uses this lair action again, or all the members of the Golgari group die. The area within the cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) poison damage.
- Tendrils of creeping fungi reach out to ensnare the enemies of the Golgari. The Golgari choose a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 60 feet of any member of the group. Each creature in the area that isn't allied with the Golgari group must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until the Golgari group uses this lair action again, all the members of the group are slain, or no member of the group is within 60 feet of the effect. A creature restrained in this way can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength check, ending the restrained effect on itself with a success.

#### REGIONAL EFFECTS

The region containing a Golgari lair is infested with mosses and strange fungi. This habitat accounts for one or both of the following effects in the surrounding undercity (the effects don't spread to the surface):

- · Moss, fungi, and other growth covers every underground surface within half a mile of the lair.
- · Fungal spores drifting throughout the lair have the power to animate corpses. Whenever a Small or Medium humanoid dies within the lair, roll a die. On an odd number, the dead creature rises up as a fungus drudge (use the zombie stat block in the Monster Manual) 1d8 hours later, unless its body is destroyed.

If all the Golgari in the lair die, the regional effects fade over 1d10 days.

# GRUUL NPCs

Like the creatures that fight alongside them, warriors and shamans of the Gruul Clans are wildly aggressive.

True to their name, the Gruul Clans include a number of different groups with their own leaders and traditions. Beyond the six most prominent clans (the Burning Tree, the Ghor, the Scab, the Slizt, the Gravel Hide, the Zhur-Taa, and the Bolrac), countless small clans-some little more than war bands-claim territories throughout the rubblebelts.

Gruul NPCs fill various clan roles. The Gruul NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the Monster Manual unless the table states otherwise.

#### GRUUL NPCs

| Role | Appropriate Stat Block |
| --- | --- |
| Clan member | Anarch* |
| Clan warrior | Berserker |
| Druid | Druid of the Old Ways* |
| Scout | Rubblebelt stalker* |
| Trog (Gruul hermit) | Gladiator |

*Appears in this chapter

#### BORBORYGMOS

For decades, the enormous cyclops Borborygmos has commanded the respect and obedience of the Gruul Clans by defeating all who challenged him. He embodies the raging fire that the Gruul believe burns in their bellies, and his wrath toward the civilization of Ravnica knows no bounds.

Mightiest of the Mighty. Borborygmos leads the Burning Tree clan, which is the largest and most diverse of the Gruul Clans. He is almost always accompanied by other members of his clan-not because he needs their protection, but because they might need his. His companions include creatures ranging from burly giants to cowering goblins.

The Gruul follow strength, and Borborygmos holds his position only because he has proved stronger than any challenger.

#### BORBORYGMOS'S TRAITS

Ideal: "We fight!" Bond: "I will bring the wilds back." Flaw: "I don't have to listen to anybody."

#### ANARCH

The rank-and-file members of the Gruul Clans, called anarchs, despise civilization and have sworn to tear down both its physical structures and its institutions.

Anarchs scavenge everything, from the hide armor they wear to the weapons they wield. As they pick through the refuse of the rubblebelts, they sometimes come across magic items and other valuable treasures.

#### NIKYA OF THE OLD WAYS

The Zhur-Taa leader, Nikya, is a powerful centaur druid of the Old Ways. In fact, she considers herself to be the last of the true Gruul druids. Though raised to be a warrior, Nikya soon discovered her natural gifts with magic. She can summon enormous constricting vines from the ancient layers of Ravnica's crust. She has little love for Borborygmos, and she believes that another leader-one who is loyal to the Old Ways-will arise among the Gruul before the End-Raze begins.

### DRUID OF THE OLD WAYS

The druids of the Old Ways are the keepers of ancient Gruul traditions devoted to the primal ferocity of animal gods such as Ilharg the Raze-Boar and Kashath the Stalker.

The End-Raze. The druids of the Old Ways believe that civilization will never be eradicated by scattered raids and petty skirmishes. They cling to the idea of a coming apocalypse, the End-Raze, when Ilharg's hoofs will trample every brick and stone of Ravnica's soaring skylines to rubble. The world will return to a state of nature in which the lawless code of muscle and savagery will reign once again.

#### RUBBLEBELT STALKER

Rubblebelt stalkers are scouts and skirmishers for the Gruul Clans. They excel at moving over challenging terrain, whether they're picking their way through treacherous ruins or clambering across rooftops. They favor ambush tactics and avoid confrontations with stronger forces, relying on their superior mobility to make their escape.

# IZZET NPCS

Though the Izzet League officially serves the function of maintaining the city's public works, most of its members join the guild to indulge their insatiable curiosity for magical knowledge. Using the guild's extensive resources and sturdy facilities, researchers pursue their studies through reckless experimentation, which often ends in destruction of property, loss of limb, or at the very least, a loud boom. Nearly all Izzet members have some capability with magic.

Izzet NPCs include chemisters, who work extensively with the magic alloy mizzium, and their attendants. The Izzet NPCs table summarizes kev roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the Monster Manual unless the table states otherwise.

#### MASTER CHEMISTER GROZGROX

Master Chemister Grozgrox is a viashino (lizardfolk) mage with a talent for shaping mizzium. His genius has earned commendations from Niv-Mizzet himself on two separate occasions, a fact that Grozgrox tries to work into conversation as often as possible.

### NIV-MIZZET

Possessed of arrogance and vanity that matches his vast intellect and tremendous power, Niv-Mizzet is the ancient dragon who founded and continues to control the Izzet League. From his private laboratory at the top of the Izzet guildhall, Niv-Mizzet directs the research and experiments of his countless underlings. He coordinates a tremendous number of apparently unrelated projects. working toward some mysterious end.

There can be little doubt that this ancient dragon is one of the most intelligent beings on Ravnica and one of the world's most powerful spellcasters. He is just as acquisitive as any dragon, but his treasure is scientific and magical knowledge. His ambition is a looming threat in the minds of all the other guildmasters, but confronting him directly is almost unthinkable thanks to the combination of his awesome magical power and the sheer physical threat of a fire-breathing, swordtoothed dragon.

#### NIV-MIZZET'S TRAITS

Ideal: "Innovation. Don't just have an idea-have all of them."

- Bond: "I have spent more than ten thousand years researching the mysteries of the world around me, but there is much more to discover."
- Flaw: "I find it tedious to converse with simpletons who lack vision."

#### BLASTSEEKERS

While chemisters focus on inventing new tools, weapons, and other devices for the guild to use, the role of a blastseeker is to put those devices to work. Despite the name, not all such devices produce explosions, but all the most interesting ones (from the Izzet perspective) do.

# ORZHOV NPCS

Every person in the Orzhov Syndicate, living or dead, has a place in the guild's rigid hierarchy. From the undead spirits that make up the ruling Obzedat to the lowly undead borrower spirits at the bottom, along with the ranks of the living in between, everyone knows where they stand: who is above them, who is below them, who owes them, and whom they owe.

The Orzhov hierarchy includes advokists who find loopholes in the law to exploit, knights who enforce the guild's will, and indentured spirits. The Orzhov NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the Monster Manual unless the table states otherwise.

TEYSA KARLOY

### OBZEDAT, THE GHOST COUNCIL

The ghosts who make up the Obzedat are traditionally called patriarchs, though they can be male or female. They are the oldest, wealthiest, and most influential oligarchs of the Orzhov Syndicate. They have been dead for centuries, but they refuse to let go of the fortunes they amassed in life. Addicted to power and prestige, these patriarchs continue to dominate the guild and accumulate even larger fortunes.

Mostly Unanimous. The ghosts of the Obzedat function as a unit, driven by their shared desire to accumulate ever more wealth for the guild. In times of disagreement, the eldest of the council exerts his seniority to bend the council to his will.

Grandfather Karlov. The head of the council, who gives final approval to its decisions and breaks ties within the group, is Karlov, known as Grandfather. In life, Karlov was the greediest of Orzhov oligarchs, and his many centuries as a spirit have not diminished his hunger for more wealth.

Undead Nature. An Obzedat ghost doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

#### THE GHOST COUNCIL'S TRAITS

Ideal: "Influence is measured in power, status, and money, but mostly money."

Bond: "Gather as much as you can while you can, for when you die, you will take it with you."

Flaw: "Everyone has a price."

#### TEYSA KARLOV

Under the authority of the Obzedat, Teysa Karlov (a mage with access to Orzhov guild spells) formerly held the title of grand envoy, serving as the representative of the Orzhov when interaction with the leadership of other guilds was necessary. A defining characteristic of the Orzhov for decades was the tension between Teysa, living in the complex political realities of the world, and the inflexible, avaricious Obzedat. Teysa argued strenuously that the Obzedat's isolationism and their reluctance to forge alliances that could make them reliant on other guilds would lead to the syndicate's downfall.

That tension reached its boiling point when Teysa enlisted the help of Tajic, Blade of the Boros Legion, in an attempt to seize power from the Obzedat. Her attempt failed, and the Obzedat imprisoned Teysa, eliminated the role of grand envoy, and canceled all dealings with other guilds. Teysa remains in prison to this day, and the Ghost Council extorts corrupt officials to make sure they keep her locked away.

Council of Five. The ghost has a trait based on who it is, as shown below:

- Enezesku: Enfeebling Ray. Enezesku's Innate Spellcasting trait includes ray of enfeeblement, which he can cast at will.
- Fautomni: Undead Fortitude. If damage reduces Fautomni to 0 hit points, he must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, Fautomni drops to 1 hit point instead.
- Karlov: Unnatural Vigor. When Karlov regains hit points, he has advantage on attack rolls he makes on his next turn.
- Vuliev: Teleportation. Vuliev's Innate Spellcasting trait includes misty step, which he can cast at will.
- Xil Xaxosz: Lingering Spite. When Xil Xaxosz is reduced to 0 hit points, his incorporeal form explodes in a burst of necrotic energy. Each creature within 5 feet of him must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Ethereal Sight. The ghost can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

Incorporeal Movement. The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Innate Spellcasting. The ghost's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At will: chill touch (at 5th level, and the ghost regains hit points equal to half the amount of damage the target takes) 1/day each: sanctuary, spirit guardians (at 4th level)

Legendary Resistance (1/Day). If the ghost fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

#### ACTIONS

Life Drain. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, and the ghost regains hit points equal to half the amount of damage the target takes. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the target finishes a long rest.

Convene the Ghost Council. The ghost summons the other four members of the Obzedat. At the start of the ghost's next turn, the other members appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of the summoner. The ghosts each roll initiative when they appear.

#### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

If five Obzedat ghosts are all within 30 feet of each other, they can collectively take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Obzedat ghosts regain spent legendary actions at the start of the turn of the ghost with the highest initiative.

- Forced Obedience. A target that all of the Obzedat ghosts can see must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or bow until the end of its next turn. Until this bow ends, the target can't take actions or reactions, and its speed is 0 and can't be increased.
- Indentured Spirits (Costs 3 Actions). The Obzedat ghosts conjure 1d6 indentured spirits (described in this chapter) within 60 feet of one of them.

# RAKDOS NPCS

The Cult of Rakdos attracts thrill seekers. Some of its members are lured by promises of hedonistic pleasure; others are drawn like moths to the spectacle of the fiery stage. They come to join a twisted community where no impulse is unacceptable, no act is too vile, and all that matters is the excitement and pleasure of the moment. They come for a chance at the spotlight-some slim hope of fame, even if it is the infamy of going down in flames. And they come for fellowship, an easy companionship without the earnest spirituality of the Selesnya, the regimented discipline of the Boros, or the hierarchy of the Orzhov.

Not every member of the guild is a performer; some members simply tag along to witness the guild's mayhem. The Rakdos NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the Monster Manual unless the table states otherwise.

*Appears in this chapter

#### RAKDOS

Rakdos, the demon for whom his cult is named, embodies hedonism. He is also the consummate entertainer. whose mere appearance is an act of grisly performance art. A monstrous figure standing thirty feet tall, spreading enormous wings, crowned with fire and swinging a flaming scythe, Rakdos demands the spotlight. His every entrance is a showstopper.

Sometimes after his grand entrance, Rakdos crouches to witness the performances of those who adore him. To them, his opinion is the only one that matters, but he is a demanding spectator. He has seen thousands of years of circus tricks and has no patience for performers who

don't give their all. His flaming scythe has brought more than one tepid show to a sudden and spectacular close.

Jaded as he is, Rakdos attends his cult's performances only rarely. He often retreats into his lair below the cult's guildhall for months or years at a time, but his followers know that he might emerge at any time to witness the latest spectacle.

#### RAKDOS'S TRAITS

Ideal: "Everyone should pursue their greatest desire." Bond: "If you want my favor, show me a performance I've never seen before."

Flaw: "What is joy?"

#### BLOOD WITCH

Blood witches imagine themselves to be the intermediaries between Rakdos and his cult-the pinnacle of his priesthood, his trusted advisors, and the messengers who communicate his will to the scattered troupes and ringmasters. The Cult of Rakdos recognizes no authority but Rakdos, and the demon lord requires no advisors. Nonetheless, the blood witches are smart, charismatic, and powerful, so their voices do carry some weight.

Blood witches strive both to protect the cult from external interference and to punish those who bring harm to the guild. They claim grandiose titles, such as Tormentor of the Wojek, as a way of mocking their intended victims.

#### RAKDOS LAMPOONER

One of the most effective weapons in the Rakdos cult's arsenal is satire, and a Rakdos lampooner is a virtuoso of that art. Lampooners generally reserve their mockery for people and guilds that have seized an outsized measure of power, those who need to be taken down a peg, rather than piling further humiliation onto those who are already struggling. They use masks, marionettes, or effigies to caricature public figures, or sometimes play pranks on those individuals directly in the streets.

### RAKDOS PERFORMER

By offering a place for those of many different talents, the Cult of Rakdos has seen its numbers swell with performing artists, including blade jugglers, fire eaters, and high wire acrobats. Performers carry the message of Rakdos out into the streets: cut loose, free yourself from the bonds of society's mores and expectations, and indulge your desires.

#### JUDITH, THE SCOURGE DIVA

ludith appears at Rakdos clubs and street shows as a singer and performance artist, combining dark soliloquies and bizarre pain stunts. She's the grande dame of the Rakdos, and what she says backstage goes.

Judith covets the adoration heaped on Rakdos by his cultists. She does countless performances a week, but the big demon gets all the praise. She has begun to assemble a small entourage of fans, toadies, and understudies who echo her complaints about the guild's leader.

- Sadistic Revelry. Each creature within 60 feet of Rakdos that is his ally or is charmed by him must use its reaction to move up to half its speed toward the creature closest to it that it can see, provided it isn't already within 5 feet of that creature. It then must make one melee attack against that creature if it is able to do so.
Scythe (Costs 2 Actions). Rakdos uses Curtain-Call Scythe. Touch of Pain (Costs 3 Actions). Rakdos makes a claw attack against one creature within 10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the creature can't maintain concentration on a spell or any other effect that requires concentration. The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### RAKDOS CARNIVAL

As lumbering giants put up makeshift stages and cackling devils ignite the footlights, the first performers begin to gather the crowds. Exuberant music with erratic rhythms draws spectators from the surrounding neighborhood, and cheers of approval greet the more accomplished performers-along with gasps and shrieks as the acts get more risky and the first blood is drawn. Acrobats cavort through the streets while sword swallowers and knife throwers flash bright steel. The crowd gets larger and wilder, the shouts and screams get louder, the fires burn brighter, and blood glistens red in the torchlight. The spectacle is gruesome but captivating; the crowd hates to watch but can't look away. Soon madness takes them, and they-devils and ogres, acrobats and spectators-are caught up in a frenzy of violence. Only when it is over does the horror of the event sink in.

A Rakdos carnival is more than the sum of its performers and its audience. It is a frenzy that grips those present, a fiendish madness that comes on suddenly and departs just as quickly, leaving gore in its wake. The carnival, in fact, has a life of its own-and when adventurers face the Cult of Rakdos in the midst of a revel, the carnival is one more foe arraved against them.

When at least six Rakdos performers perform together in public, they can call on the carnival to aid them. When determining the difficulty of such an encounter, consider the carnival to be one additional creature of challenge rating 3.

#### LAIR ACTIONS

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the carnival takes a lair action, causing one of the following effects; the carnival can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Fire erupts from the ground at up to four points of the DM's choice in the carnival. The fire lasts for 1 minute or until this action is used again. Each jet of flame is a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 5-foot radius. Each creature in the cylinder when it first appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that starts its turn in the flames must also make the saving throw.
- Whirling blades, spiked chains, or other implements of agony appear for a moment to menace 1d6 random creatures in a 20-foot cube. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) force damage.
- · Blood splashes all creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within the carnival. Each creature in that area becomes the target of a confusion spell (save DC 15).

#### REGIONAL EFFECTS

The carnival exerts a powerful influence over those who come close to the festivities:

- · When a creature that is outside the carnival sees or hears it, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or use its movement each round to move toward the carnival. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.
- · If a creature attempts to leave the carnival, the creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature instead moves toward the center of the carnival. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.

If all the Rakdos performers in the carnival die or leave its area, these effects end immediately.

# SELESNYA NPCS

Those drawn to the Selesnya Conclave find the guild's mission of inclusion and harmony appealing. They gain comfort and fulfillment from the guild's peaceful coexistence with civilization and untamed nature. But the guild's drive isn't only to draw people into a peaceable community: the Selesnya aim to build an army. They aren't naive; they realize that the ambitions of other guilds will lead to violence, and they plan to be prepared for it.

Despite the guild's atmosphere of peaceful quietude. many of its members have military roles. The Selesnya NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the Monster Manual unless the table states otherwise.

TROSTANI

The Selesnya guildmaster is an amalgamation of three dryads in body, will, and soul. Each dryad's body extends from a central trunk, so while they possess independent minds, they share a single name-Trostaniand a single life force. Usually Trostani communicates the will of the Worldsoul with one voice, but she retains three distinct personalities that embody the three parts of the Selesnyan ideal: order, life, and harmony. In the midst of increasing tensions on Ravnica, the three personalities have recently been at odds over how best to navigate the conclave through such difficult times.

Trostani spends most of her time in the towering tree of Vitu-Ghazi, the Selesnya guildhall. There she communes with Mat'Selesnya and with the dryads who lead individual Selesnya communities across Ravnica.

#### TROSTANI'S TRAITS

Ideal: "In each of us is the strength of all of us." Bond: "All will come to the warm embrace of the Conclave."

Flaw: "I have nothing but anger for those who break the bonds of the community and leave our embrace."

#### HORNCALLER

Specialized shamans called horncallers use their magic to call wild beasts to fight alongside Selesnya troops. In quieter times, they tend the animals associated with Selesnya enclaves and parks.

As a friend of Jace Beleren, she understands that he's never going to be able to settle on Ravnica, so she believes the world needs a replacement for the Guildpact. Emmara plays an active role in her community, and she has many non-Selesnya friends aside from the Guildpact. One of the most active advocates of cooperation among the guilds, she is relying on personal connections with members of other guilds to help that effort.

# SIMIC NPCs

Curiosity about the manifold wonders of life-as well as the magical science involved in modifying it-leads inquisitive and ambitious minds from across Ravnica to join the Simic Combine. Grouped together in clades and projects, Simic scientists look for new ways to speed the nature's processes of adaptation and evolution, preparing organisms of all kinds that can thrive in the dangerous and ever-changing urban environment.

Most Simic researchers are humans, vedalken, elves, and merfolk, or at least they were born that way. During their careers, they might give themselves such a wide variety of adaptations and augmentations that their heritage is hard to ascertain. The Simic NPCs table summarizes kev roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the Monster Manual unless the table states otherwise.

### PRIME SPEAKER ZEGANA

The regal and reticent Prime Speaker Zegana is the merfolk guildmaster of the Simic Combine. She upholds the traditional ways of the guild and its utopian philosophy, which espouses a vision of an ideal world in which nature and civilization coexist in perfect balance. Some people in the guild-members of the Adaptationist faction in particular-argue that her ways are outdated and the guild requires more practical leadership. In response, Zegana maintains that she serves as prime speaker only at the sufferance of the Speakers' Chamber, and if the other speakers wish to replace her, they are certainly within their rights to do so.

#### ZEGANA'S TRAITS

Ideal: "Nature's patterns are the schematics for how to improve."

- Bond: "I will use all the resources at my disposal to see that Ravnica becomes the best it can be."
- Flaw: "I can't understand how progress could ever be the wrong goal."

#### BIOMANCER

Nearly all the innovation and advancement in Simic bioengineering comes from the work of biomancers. Specialists in hybridizing and altering creatures through a mixture of science and magic, they have spawned countless hybrids and krasis in search of the perfect union between nature and civilization.
