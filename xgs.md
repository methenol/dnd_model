## COLLEGE OF WHISPERS

Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like other bards, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.

Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses a bard's reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.

#### WORDS OF SPITE

When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to make your words magically toxic to a creature's mind.

As an action, or as a reaction when you take damage, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal 2d6 psychic damage to a creature within 30 feet of you. If used as a reaction, you must target the creature that damaged you. You can do so only once per round.

If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this damage, you can steal thoughts from its broken mind, gaining access to memories from the last 24 hours of its life, as well as any significant memories of the DM's choosing. Once you steal thoughts from a creature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.

#### WORDS OF TERROR

At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror.

If you speak to a humanoid while no other visible creatures are within 30 feet for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice.

While frightened in this way, the target is terrified of the creature you chose; if you chose yourself, the target flees and becomes intensely paranoid, trying to avoid the company of all others and seeking out the safest, most secret place available to it to hide in. If you chose another creature, the target believes the creature seeks to harm it in any way possible and behaves accordingly. This effect ends on the target after 1 hour. until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.

If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### MANTLE OF WHISPERS

At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona. As an action, you can magically capture the shadow of a humanoid corpse within 5 feet that has been dead no longer than 10 minutes. You retain this shadow until you dismiss it (no action required), or capture another.

You can use the shadow as a bonus action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. You have access to this disguise as long as you retain its shadow, and can switch between your normal appearance and the disguise as a bonus action.

While you retain the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.

Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check.

Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.

### SHADOW LORE

At 14th level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature's deepest fears.

As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically fails if it can't hear you, or if it speaks no languages. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.

On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. During this time, you and the creature can understand what the other says, even if you don't share a language. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.

The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won't risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.

When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## PATH OF THE STORM HERALD

All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.

Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world's end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

#### STORM AURA

Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.

If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

Desert. When this effect is activated, all creatures of your choice in your aura take 1d4 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 10th level, 1d10 at 15th level, and 1d12 at 20th level.

Sea. When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d4 + your Constitution modifier lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d4 at 10th level, 3d4 at 15th level, and 4d4 at 20th level.

Tundra. When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 1d4 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 10th level, 1d10 at 15th level, and 1d12 at 20th level.

#### STORM SOUL

At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn't active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

Desert. You gain resistance to fire damage. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.

Sea. You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming speed of 30 feet.

Tundra. You gain resistance to cold damage. Moreover, as an action, you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the cube.

#### SHIELDING STORM

At 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.

#### RAGING STORM

At 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

Desert. Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to half your barbarian level.

Sea. When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.

Tundra. Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.

## FORGE DOMAIN

The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

## DOMAIN SPELLS Cleric Level Spells

| 1st | absorb elements, searing smite |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | arcane lock, heat metal |
| 5th | melf's minute meteors, tiny servant |
| 7th | fabricate, fire shield |
| 9th | animate objects, creation |

## BONUS PROFICIENCIES

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons, heavy armor and two artisan tools of your choice.

onto weapons and armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of medium or heavy armor or a weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item:

- · A weapon counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities.
- · A suit of armor becomes more durable. When a creature wearing this suit of armor takes nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, the damage is reduced by 2. Multiple effects of damage reduction do not stack, you choose which to use.

Additionally, its blessed by you can't be affected or altered by magical effects (such as heat metal) unless you wish it to be affected.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## CHANNEL DIVINITY: ARTISAN'S BLESSING

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items.

You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object (see chapter 5, "Equipment," in the Player's Handbook for examples of these items). The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.

The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual's end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation. The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

## CHANNEL DIVINITY: MOLTEN FORM

At 6th level, you can use a bonus action to present your holy symbol and summon a molten suit of armor around yourself, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated. You can also dismiss Molten Form at any time you choose (no action required).

While your molten form is active, you gain the following benefits:

- · Your AC can't be less than 17.
- At the start of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit . points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).
- You can use your Wisdom modifier for attack and damage rolls with melee weapons.
- · When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes fire damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

## HEIGHTENED BLESSING

Also at 6th level, the potency of your blessings have improved. In addition to previous benefits, weapons and armor blessed by you gain the following additional features:

- · A weapon blessed by you now deals an additional 1d6 fire damage once per turn.
- · A suit of armor blessed by you now reduces all bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the wearer takes by 4.

Additionally, you can bless two objects whenever you finish a long rest.

## DIVINE STRIKE

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the fiery power of the forge. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

## SAINT OF FORGE AND FIRE

At 17th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal reaches its peak. In addition to previous benefits, weapons and armor blessed by you gain the following additional features:

- · Armor blessed by you now grants the wearer resistance to fire damage, and the wearer can as a reaction to being hit by a melee attack, deal 2d6 fire damage to the attacker.
- · The extra damage granted by your blessing on a weapon increases to 2d6 fire damage, and this damage now ignores resistance to fire damage.

Finally any weapons and armor you wield or wear are always under the effects of your blessings.

## CIRCLE OF DREAMS

Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druids' guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and where the weary can find rest.

## BALM OF THE SUMMER COUNT

At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. While a creature has temporary hit points granted by this feature, its movement speed is increased by 10 feet.

## CIRCLE SPELLS

Your mystical connection to the feywild infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid Level | Circle Spells |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | augury |
| 5 th | catnap |
| 7th | phantasmal killer |
| 9th | dream |

#### HEARTH OF MOONLIGHT AND SHADOW

At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.

While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside it.

The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.

## HIDDEN PATHS

Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eve. As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

## WALKER IN DREAMS

At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.

When vou finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: dream (with you as the messenger), scrying, or teleportation circle.

This use of teleportation circle is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven't taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn't wasted.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## CIRCLE OF THE SHEPHERD

Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.

#### SPEECH OF THE WOODS

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.

You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past.

#### SPIRIT TOTEM

Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.

As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.

The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

The effect of the spirit's aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.

Bear Spirit. The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. A number of creature eqaul to your Wisdom modifier of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.

Eagle Spirit. The eagle spirit lends its swiftness to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition, creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against vou and your allies while in the aura.

Wolf Spirit. The wolf spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its instincts. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit's aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. You and vour allies gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks in the spirit's aura.

## MIGHTY SUMMONER

Starting at 6th level, beasts and fev that you coniure are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits:

- · The creature has temporary hitpoints equal to your Wisdom modifier.
- · The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### GUARDIAN SPIRIT

At 10th level, you can call upon a spiritual companion to aid you in your travels. You gain the find familiar spell. You always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the following aspects for your familiar to take on: Bear, Hawk, or Wolf. Your familiar gains features based on your choice. Whenever you cast find familiar, you can choose a different aspect.

Bear Aspect. Your familiar embodies the might of the bear. While your familiar is within 5 feet of you, you have advantage on Strength checks.

Eagle Aspect. Your familiar embodies the hawk's swiftness. While your familiar is within 5 feet of you, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against vou.

Wolf Aspect. Your familiar embodies the wolf's cunning. While your familiar is within 5 feet of you, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track other creatures, and you can pick up a creature's trail in half the normal time.

#### SPIRIT LINK

At 14th level, your connection to spirits deepens.

When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: commune with nature, contact other plane or speak with dead.

This use of contact other plane is special. Rather than making an Intelligence saving throw, you can instead make a Wisdom saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## ARCANE MARKSMAN

An Arcane Marksman studies a unique method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. These techniques are the favorite of a variety of expert marksmen, including elite elven sentinels, dwarven gnoll hunters, and a number of well-known mercenaries. Requiring both a mastery of ranged combat and an understanding of the arcane arts, Arcane Marksmen stand out as versatile and effective sharpshooters.

## ARCANE SHOT

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to infuse your shots with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical piece of ammunition from a ranged weapon, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the shot immediately after it hits or misses its target.

Additionally, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see the "Arcane Shot Options" section below). Once per turn when you fire a magical piece of ammunition from a ranged weapon as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that shot. You decide to use the option when the attack hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You have a number of uses of this ability equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.

## ARCANE MARKSMAN LORE

At 3rd level, you learn magical theory. You gain proficiency in Arcana, and learn the prestidigitation cantrip.

## CURVING SHOT

At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magical piece of ammunition and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 30 feet of the original target.

## FORCEFUL SHOT

Beginning at 10th level, when you hit a creature with an Arcane Shot, you can spend an additional use of Arcane Shot to knock the target prone.

## EVER-READY SHOT

Starting at 15th level, your marksmanship is always ready for a fight. When you roll initiative, you regain one use of Arcane Shot. If you have no uses remaining, you regain two uses of it instead.

Additionally, you can conjure 30 pieces of ammunition as a bonus action, which disappear after 1 minute. You choose the type of ammunition, which is magical and appears in your quiver or equivalent container.

## ARCANE SHOT OPTIONS

The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic. If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

Banishing Shot. You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target from this plane. If the shot hits a creature, the target must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 1d6 force damage when the shot hits it.

Beguiling Shot. Your enchantment magic causes this shot to temporarily beguile its target. Choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage, and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.

The psychic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

Bursting Shot. You imbue your shot with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The energy detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 1d6 force damage each.

The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

Enfeebling Shot. You weave necromantic magic into your shot. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.

The necrotic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

Grasping Shot. When this shot strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 1d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 1d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this arcane shot option again.

The poison and slashing damage both increase to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

Piercing Shot. You use transmutation magic to give your shot an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot fires forward in a line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 force damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.

The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

Seeking Shot. Using divination magic, you grant your shot the ability to seek out your target. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.

The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

Shadow Shot. You weave illusion magic into your shot, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with shadows. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage, and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away from itself until the start of vour next turn.

The psychic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

## WAY OF THE SOHEI

Armed combat is simply another martial art, one that followers of the Way of the Sohei have perfected. By honing various weapon styles, these soldier monks turn armaments into extensions of their own bodies. Monasteries of Sōhei can serve training grounds for armies. A Sōhei is ready to make the warzone their own; their weapon is a brush, and the battlefield is their canvas.

## ART OF WAR

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your armed martial arts training leads you to master many weapons.

You have proficiency with all martial melee weapons that lack the heavy, two-handed, and special properties. These

count as monk weapons for you when used with one hand. Additionally, weapons count as half their weight for determining carrying capacity.

## DIVINE SOUL

Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god's name.

Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.

When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list.

## SHADOW MAGIC

You are a creature of shadow, for your innate magic comes from the Shadowfell itself. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its fell energy and transformed by it.

As an action, you can reduce the range of this ability to 60 feet and choose a creature within 30 feet of you.

Being connected to such power can cause changes in your behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron, and a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days.

More active on the Material Plane than many others of its kind, the Dullahan is a reaper and debt collector both, a figure whos appearance - that of a black cloaked rider upon a grey stallion that holds its own head under one arm, a scythe of bluish cold iron clutched in the other - is a harbinger of despair and dark times to come. It collects the souls of those who are fated to die, and reaps those who have escaped the clutches of death; the only way to ward against this creature, so it is said, is with gold.

## WAR MAGIC

A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster's spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses.

Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle. using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents' attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters' magical energy against them.

In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense. A war mage's typical response: "What good is being able to throw a mighty fireball if I die before I can cast it?"

#### ARCANE DEFLECTION

At 2nd level, you have learned to weave your magic to fortify yourself against harm. When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4, and add the number roll to your AC against that attack or to that saving throw.

## TACTICAL WIT

Starting at 2nd level, your keen ability to assess tactical situations allows you to act quickly in battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.

## POWER SURGE

Starting at 6th level, you can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging spells. In its stored form, this energy is called a power surge.

You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a spell with dispel magic or counterspell, you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.

Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power surge to deal 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier extra force damage to that target.

#### DURABLE MAGIC

Beginning at 10th level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and add a d4 to all saving throws.

#### DEFLECTING SHROUD

At 14th level, your Arcane Deflection becomes infused with deadly magic. When you use your Arcane Deflection feature, you can cause magical energy to arc from you. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you each take 1d6 + your Inteligence modfierer force damage.
